Item 1. Business.
Our Business
Lulus is a customer-driven, digitally-native fashion brand primarily serving Millennial and Gen Z women. We focus relentlessly on giving our customers what they want. We do this by using data coupled with human insight to deliver a curated and continuously evolving assortment of on-point, affordable luxury fashion. Our customer obsession sets the tone for everything we do, from our personalized online shopping experience to our exceptional customer service. 
We are focused on building authentic personal relationships with our customers and offering them coveted products they cannot purchase elsewhere. We incorporate the pulse of the consumer by engaging with her where she is: across the web, on social media and across our platform, through reviews, feedback and one-on-one interactions with our Style Advisors, Fit Experts and Bridal Concierge. Customers express their love for our brand on social media and by word-of-mouth (both in-person and online). 
A key differentiator of our business model from traditional fashion retail is our use of data to optimize almost all elements of our business. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in our product creation and curation cycle. Traditional merchandising approaches are risk and capital intensive, characterized by extended in-house design cycles, seasonal assortment decisions, deep buys, limited customer feedback, and high markdowns. Unlike traditional retailers, we leverage a “test, learn, and reorder” strategy to bring hundreds of new products to market every week; we test them in small batches, learn about customer demand and then quickly reorder winning products in higher volume to optimize profitability. This strategy allows us to rapidly convert new products into profitable sales on a consistent and repeatable basis while minimizing fashion and trend risk. 
We are proud of our large, diverse community of loyal customers. Our target customer initially meets us in her 20s and stays with us through her 30s and beyond. We design a broad assortment of affordable luxury fashion for many of life’s moments. 
Recent Developments
On November 10, 2021, our registration statement on Form S-1 relating to our initial public offering (“IPO”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the shares of our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on November 11, 2021. The IPO closed on November 15, 2021, pursuant to which we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share. On November 15, 2021, we received net proceeds of approximately $82.0 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $6.1 million and other issuance costs of approximately $3.9 million. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, we filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which authorized a total of 250,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding were converted into 15,000,000 shares of common stock. Additionally, 215,702 shares of common stock were issued to the LP immediately prior to the completion of the IPO. All shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series B-1 Preferred Stock were redeemed and extinguished for a total payment of approximately $17.9 million on November 15, 2021.
Why We Win
Customer-Driven Fashion Brand:    Lulus is one of the first digitally-native fashion brands in the United States primarily serving Millennial and Gen Z women. We take pride in our ability to offer more luxurious fabrics and incorporate elevated stylistic details into our products relative to what is offered by other comparably-priced brands. Our obsessive focus on customer experience creates deep personal connections, which in turn rewards us with customer loyalty and word-of-mouth sharing of the brand.
Customer-Centric Experience:    We are passionate about building a brand synonymous with exceptional customer service. We have effectively brought the boutique experience online, developing one-on-one relationships with our customers in order to learn and then address their individual needs. The number one reason our customers contact us is for personalized fit and styling assistance. We are able to offer standardized sizing across the Lulus assortment, simplifying the shopping experience and giving our customer confidence that she is selecting the best fit.

Leveraging Data to Best Serve our Customer:    We have built a massive dataset which gives us strong insight into our customers. Millions of customers have interacted with us, leaving detailed reviews, interacting with our on-demand Style Advisors, Fit Experts, and Bridal Concierge, and completing checkout surveys. Across Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube, our over 7.8 million followers engage with us through their comments, feedback, and photographs, and support of our brand with their digital followers. In aggregate, this dataset gives us a deep understanding of our customers’ preferences. 
Marketing and Engagement Strategy:    We engage with our customer where she is, in authentic and personalized ways: through our website, mobile app, email, SMS, and on social media. This strategy helps drive brand awareness while fostering deep connections with our customers. Our authentic partnerships with brand ambassadors span the full spectrum of followership and engagement levels, from nano- and micro-influencers, to college ambassadors and celebrities, all of whom wear and genuinely love our brand. 
Data-Driven Product Creation Strategy:    Our innovative product creation strategy leverages the power of data and our “test, learn, and reorder” approach to bring new styles online almost every weekday. We are able to optimize our inventory levels to meet customer demand and minimize markdowns. This efficient, data-driven process, coupled with human insight, allows us to respond to fashion trends with speed and precision while significantly reducing risk in our business. 
Marketing
Our marketing strategy leverages our strong visual brand presence to build awareness and drive engagement with our large, diverse community of loyal customers. We integrate the power of data across multiple channels to offer a singular brand voice that speaks to Millennial and Gen Z women. We meet the Lulus customer wherever she is, enabling her discovery of the brand and providing her numerous opportunities to interact with others in the Lulus community. Through this engagement with our customers, we strive to build personal connections that are authentic and durable. We attract and engage customers through a combination of owned, earned and paid media.
Upon attracting a new or existing customer to our website or mobile experience, we seek to maximize conversion through a variety of strategies: 

● | Brand Strength and Exclusivity: As a digitally-native fashion brand, we benefit from the ability to focus our resources, as well as our customers’ attention, primarily on the Lulus brand, without the distraction or complexity of managing and marketing a large multi-brand portfolio. As a result, we focus on offering the best possible assortment of Lulus products for our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product Reviews: One of the most important aspects of our digital shopping experience is our extensive database of proprietary customer product reviews, which we first enabled in 2012 and now amounts to over 750,000 reviews. Our website has the functionality to allow customers to upload their own product photos along with their reviews, which bring the products to life on a diverse array of body types. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Boutique Styling Experience: We strive to offer exceptional customer service before, during, and after each purchase. We accomplish this by continuously improving the boutique experience on our platform through features such as our product recommendation engine and targeted messaging and with our in-house team of customer service associates who maintain deep expertise of our brand, products, and systems. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Personalized and Optimized Shopping Experience: We customize and personalize our interactions with each Lulus customer by monitoring information such as how she arrives on our site, her on-site behavior, and what she buys. Our customer insights, predictive capabilities, product recommendations, and custom-built website work seamlessly together to offer each customer a personalized experience across web, mobile, our mobile app, email, and SMS. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These strategies work in unison to help drive order conversion. Whether she is browsing social media or providing feedback on a recent purchase, we engage with our customer across a multitude of touchpoints throughout the discovery and purchase journey.

Enhance and Retain Existing Customer Relationships 
We have a large and growing Lulus community and we served 2.8 million Active Customers during the year ended January 2, 2022. We continue to leverage data-driven customer insights to develop strong customer relationships and become a one-stop shop for Gen Z and Millennial women. For example, we have had success leveraging data-driven insights across categories to offer personalized suggestions and reminders at targeted points in time, and we are focused on expanding these capabilities to provide enhanced real-time recommendations and post-purchase engagement. Additionally, we continually develop and evaluate new tools and programs designed to improve the key customer metrics that drive our business, such as frequency of purchase and Average Order Value through the following strategies:

Pursue Category Expansion 
We believe there is tremendous potential to continue to drive growth in our underpenetrated categories. We have a significant opportunity to grow our share of total apparel budget with expansion into these underdeveloped areas. For example, our recent success in bridal and swimwear demonstrates our ability to successfully launch and grow share in new categories. Our deep and personal engagement with our customers through product reviews, exit surveys and social media feedback helps us understand the product categories they are most interested in shopping and will continue to inform the breadth and depth of the categories we offer. 
Due to our customer data-driven product creation strategy, we have the ability to test new categories with minimal upfront investment and risk. New categories are opened with a controlled assortment of branded and partner products through which we learn to understand customer demand via our reorder algorithms. Our ability to leverage our existing categories to introduce and grow new ones has resulted in customer repeat orders with strong product diversification. 
Pursue International Expansion 
While we expect the majority of our near-term growth to continue to come from the United States, we believe that serving international customers represents a long-term growth opportunity. To date, we have shipped our merchandise to over 100 countries, while spending minimal dollars on marketing outside of the United States, demonstrating our global appeal and broader market opportunity. Our long term strategy is to increase our focus on global performance media and to optimize our platform and distribution processes for international customers, allowing for more flexibility across languages and currencies. We believe that providing a localized shopping experience will significantly enhance our ability to serve customers in international markets. 
Technology
The www.lulus.com website, mobile app, merchandising, customer, order, and warehouse management systems are proprietary, purpose-built solutions with the goal of delivering the best possible customer experience and operational efficiency. From payment card industry compliant checkout to the software running on handheld barcode scanners in order fulfillment, these key software processes are developed, maintained, and enhanced by our in-house engineering and data teams to meet and exceed our customers’ expectations in a scalable way. Data-driven insights are core to what we do at Lulus. Technology drives and supports our business in several foundational areas, like our merchandising test, learn and reorder model, our cost-efficient marketing, and high operational efficiency. 
Our proprietary reorder system is informed and powered by our data warehouse with predictive data modeling and business intelligence. Sales analyses across hundreds of product attributes and assortment architecture and trend analyses inform our buyers’ selection of new styles. Customer demand and return signal data, product profitability, seasonality, and product demand prediction are taken into consideration to advise our reorder buyers which products to reorder, when those reorders should arrive, and in what quantities.
We combine purpose-built technology systems with customer focused engineering and data teams, to provide us with deep customer behavior insights. Integrating information from many available sources, from customer actions and feedback on the platforms to predictive analysis, continuously enhances our understanding of customer preference. This understanding allows us to activate personalization across our platform and in our various marketing channels.
We also use our technology to optimize our operational efficiency as e-commerce fulfillment and reverse logistics are critical to profitability. Our business model is characterized by high SKU velocity, low to no SKU affinity, quick order-to-to-ship requirements, short return-to-refund timelines, and fast inventory turnover. We have built our own proprietary, integrated e-commerce backend system to minimize cost and maximize customer satisfaction.
We have built our software development and deployment cycles such that software changes can be deployed daily after being verified by fully automated testing, as well as by human functional testing. We work with reputable cloud services providers across multiple data centers, with fully redundant infrastructure within each data center, as well as with full failover capability between data centers, which allows us to serve our customers at virtually any time. Our infrastructure is flexible and scalable to provide our customers with the best possible shopping experience.

Security and Data Protection
We are committed to the security of our customers’ data and personal information. We aggregate and analyze data in order to optimize the customer experience internally, and do not monetize the information we collect by selling it to third parties for their own external purposes. We utilize both on-premise and cloud-based technologies and undertake technical and other administrative measures to ensure the protection of our systems and customer data. We use various in-house and third-party tools to support our security policies and procedures including user access controls, server monitoring, (web) firewalls, security content policies, and data encryption. We also use external certified security partners to test for vulnerabilities in our software and infrastructure, and assist in our security practices, which are designed to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Finally, we have implemented processes and procedures to allow customers to review and remove their non-transactional account data. 
Competition
The women’s apparel, footwear, and accessories industry is large, fragmented, highly competitive and rapidly evolving. The industry consists of various brands and retailers that employ several different operating models at varying price points, and consumers have the option to shop both offline and online. Our competition includes traditional brands and retailers who market to consumers via offline and online channels. Our competition also includes e-commerce retailers that generally operate as online department stores for third-party and/or private label brands. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we increase our brand awareness, expand our categories, and pursue international expansion. 
Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, quality, concept, price, breadth, and style of merchandise, as well as customer service, brand image, brand quality, strength of brand relationships, and ability to anticipate, identify, and respond to new and changing fashion trends. Because we are an early mover in our category, we believe we have a significant head start on becoming the go-to brand for Millennial and Gen Z consumers. As one of the first digitally-native brands, Lulus is well-positioned to capitalize on our deep digital footprint, social media infrastructure, loyal and active customer community, and product creation model. As a vertically integrated business, we retain full control of critical aspects of our business including brand, product, marketing, distribution, and customer service. Our long operating history means that we have collected a valuable dataset over the last decade while refining an efficient, scalable business model. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in our second and third fiscal quarters compared to the rest of the year. We believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our results of operations. We recognized 18%, 28%, 28%, and 26% of our annual net revenue during the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, respectively.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
Our trademarks, including LULUS® and 
®, are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own the registrations for LULU’S®, LOVELULUS®, and COVETED CURATED COLLECTED®. We own the domain name www.lulus.com. We believe the Lulus® trademark has significant value in the marketing of our merchandise. We have registrations in Canada, the European Union (the “EU”), the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, China, and several other countries, as well as additional pending international applications. We vigorously protect our intellectual property rights. 
Regulation and Legislation 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising and promotions, privacy laws, safety regulations, customer protection regulations and other laws that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 
We are also subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations 

11



include federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which address, among other things, the privacy and security of consumer information, sending of commercial email, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. 
Under applicable federal and state laws and regulations addressing privacy and data security, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies with respect to the collection and use of personal information, our sharing of personal information with third parties, and notice of any changes to our data handling practices. In some instances, we may be obligated to give customers the right to prevent sharing of their personal information with third parties. Under applicable federal and state laws, we also are required to adhere to a number of requirements when sending commercial email to consumers, including identifying advertising and promotional emails as such, ensuring that subject lines are not deceptive, giving consumers an opportunity to opt-out of further communications and clearly disclosing our name and physical address in each commercial email. Regulation of privacy and data security matters is an evolving area, with new laws and regulations enacted frequently. For example, California enacted legislation effective January 1, 2020 that, among other things, requires certain disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. Other states are following suit. In addition, under applicable federal and state unfair competition laws, including the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulations, we must, and our network of influencers may be required to, accurately identify product offerings, not make misleading claims on our websites or in advertising, and use qualifying disclosures where and when appropriate. The growth and demand for e-commerce could result in more stringent domestic and foreign consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on companies that transact substantial business on the internet. 
Our international business is subject to additional laws and regulations, including restrictions on imports from, exports to, and services provided to persons located in certain countries and territories, as well as foreign laws and regulations addressing topics such as advertising and marketing practices, customs duties and taxes, privacy, data protection, information security and consumer rights, any of which might apply by virtue of our sales in foreign countries and territories or our contacts with consumers in such foreign countries and territories. For example, the United States and China and the United States and Mexico, where certain of our products are manufactured, have recently engaged in an escalating trade war, which has led to each side threatening tariffs that could adversely affect our business and results of operations or cause us to relocate manufacturing to other countries and territories, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, the EU has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which imposes stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data of individuals from the EU and provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance. Furthermore, there is also increased focus on EU and UK privacy laws in respect of cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing, and there has been significant recent European court and regulatory decisions in this area, including through privacy activists. More generally, many foreign jurisdictions have laws, regulations, or other requirements relating to privacy, data protection, and consumer protection, and countries and territories are adopting new legislation or other obligations with increasing frequency. Many of these laws may require consent from consumers for the use of data for various purposes, including marketing, which may reduce our ability to market our products. 
In many jurisdictions, there is great uncertainty whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e-commerce. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and e-commerce could result in significant additional obligations on our business or may necessitate changes to our business practices. These obligations or required changes could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. Further, any actual or alleged failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations by us, our suppliers or our network of influencers could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defending against proceedings or investigations, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary penalties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—A failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations, or changes to such laws, may adversely affect our business, financial performance, results of operations, or business growth.” 
Human Capital Resources 
As of January 2, 2022, we had 736 full-time and part-time employees. We use contingent labor in varying levels throughout the year to augment our workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 

12



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. We believe our compensation programs are competitive relative to others in our industry and geography and are designed to attract, retain and reward personnel through the combination of cash-based compensation, equity-based compensation and benefits.
In support of diversity and inclusion, we advanced our Belonging, Dignity, Justice and Joy (“BDJJ”) initiatives during 2021, including the creation of employee-led affinity groups backed by strong leadership support. These affinity groups create opportunities for employees to share their diverse perspectives and connect with each other on a deeper level and are intended to foster a culture that is open, inclusive and respectful.
