Sale of Highway Products Business
In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed the sale of Trinity Highway Products, LLC (“THP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of THP, to Rush Hour Intermediate II, LLC, an entity owned by an affiliated investment fund of Monomoy Capital Partners, for an aggregate purchase price of $375.0 million, subject to certain adjustments. THP is a leading manufacturer and global supplier of commercial highway products.
We concluded that the sale of THP represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, we have presented the operating results and cash flows of THP as discontinued operations for all periods in this 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of prior periods have been recast to reflect these changes and present results on a comparable basis. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the sale of THP.
Reportable Segments
Following the sale of THP, we report our operating results in two reportable segments. All segment results set forth herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis.

Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group ("Leasing Group") is a leading provider in North America of comprehensive railcar industry services. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Trinity Industries Leasing Company ("TILC"), and partially-owned subsidiaries, TRIP Rail Holdings LLC (“TRIP Holdings”) and RIV 2013 Rail Holdings LLC ("RIV 2013"), we primarily offer operating leases for freight and tank railcars. Trinity's Rail Products Group and TILC coordinate sales and marketing activities under the TrinityRail platform, thereby providing a single point of contact for railroads, shippers, and third-party leasing companies seeking rail equipment and services.
In addition, TILC originates and manages railcar leases for third-party investors and provides fleet maintenance and management services to industrial shippers. Our affiliations with third-party investor-owned funds, through strategic railcar alliances and the formation of railcar investment vehicles, combined with TILC's fleet maintenance and management services capabilities, complement our leasing business by generating stable fee income, strengthening customer relationships, and enhancing the view of TrinityRail as a leading provider of railcar products and services. 
The railcars in our lease fleet are leased to industrial shippers and railroads. These companies operate in various markets including agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and chemicals. Substantially all of the railcars in our lease fleet were manufactured by our Rail Products Group. The terms of our railcar leases generally provide for fixed monthly rentals that vary from one to ten years. We compete in the North American full-service leasing market primarily against four major railcar lessors, as well as numerous smaller lessors. We serve our customers predominantly through full-service leases and compete primarily on the basis of the quality and craftsmanship of our railcars, competitive pricing, and our ability to provide an outstanding customer experience. 
As of December 31, 2021, the lease fleet of our subsidiaries included 106,970 railcars that were 95.7% utilized, of which 104,715 railcars were owned by TILC or its affiliates and 2,255 railcars were leased from others and are not reflected in the property, plant, and equipment amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Railcars under management, including those owned by third-party investors, totaled 136,100 railcars.
Lease Fleet Diversification
The following charts provide additional information with respect to the number of railcars in the Company's lease fleet. 
(1) Data presented in this chart reflects the number of railcars in our wholly-owned and partially-owned lease fleet, which totaled 106,970 railcars as of December 31, 2021.

Rail Products Group. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries with facilities in the U.S. and Mexico, our Rail Products Group is a leading manufacturer of freight and tank railcars in North America used for transporting a wide variety of liquids, gases, and dry cargo. 
We believe that our Rail Products Group's diversified manufacturing capabilities enable us to capitalize on changing industry trends and developing opportunities in various markets. Additionally, we offer a full range of maintenance services and flexible solutions, from field inspections and comprehensive compliance testing to standard repairs and maintenance, specialized cleaning, inspection, and testing at multiple facilities in the U.S. We also provide modification capabilities and assist in transitioning railcars to new industry standards. We believe that our investment in maintenance services extends and enhances our ability to serve our customers and our lease fleet.
Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, and industrial shippers of products in various markets, such as agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and chemicals. We compete in the North American market primarily against four major railcar manufacturers and numerous maintenance services providers.
We hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcars and components. We believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances. No material revenues are received from the licensing of these patents.
Marketing.
We sell or lease substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple U.S. locations, as well as Canada and Mexico. We also use independent sales representatives on a limited basis.
Raw Materials and Suppliers.
Railcar Specialty Components and Steel. Products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials, such as steel, as well as numerous specialty components, such as brakes, wheels, heads, side frames, bolsters and bearings. The input costs for materials, including raw steel, specialty components, and other parts and coatings purchased from third parties represent, on average, more than 70% of the cost of most railcars. Although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years, at least two suppliers continue to produce most components.
The principal material used in railcar manufacturing is steel. During 2021, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Steel prices have increased significantly since 2020 and are major components of our cost of revenues. Steel and component prices may be volatile in the future as a result of market conditions, changes in tariffs or other governmental policies. We typically use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of plate and coil steel price volatility on our operating profit. However, higher steel prices could result in increases in the cost of certain railcar components and could also reduce demand for new railcars. We may from time to time experience shortages of materials used in the production of certain railcar types; however, in general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels, and the existing contracts and relationships that we have in place will meet our current production forecasts.

Additionally, all of our rail operations are certified through the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care® Management System, which guides the continual improvement of our environmental, health, and safety practices and performance and applies to all our operations and employees, including contractors.
Workforce Talent and Diversity. We are committed to attracting and retaining highly skilled and diverse employees and are proud that our workforce is made up of talented people from a variety of backgrounds. This commitment to diversity as a driver of our long-term success is one that we strive to uphold throughout the Company, including through all stages of our human resources process, from recruitment and hiring to talent retention.
We encourage and support employee resource and networking groups, our diversity and inclusion committee, and other employee groups, which offer educational, professional development, and community service opportunities. We also provide focused training, mentoring, and employee development for specialized positions, such as plant managers, engineers, accountants, and more.
Through strategies such as our employee experience survey, our employee recognition program, and a comprehensive commitment to our core values, we are dedicated to building a healthy, engaging workplace where employees can thrive and do their best work. We pride ourselves on maintaining an active dialogue with our employees. In our facilities, for example, we benchmark overall employee engagement with an annual cross-organization survey targeting metrics such as safety, job satisfaction, and more.

Commitment to Sustainability.
We recognize that further integrating the key principles of sustainability, including environmental stewardship, safety and quality assurance, corporate social responsibility, governance, and diversity and inclusion, are important to enhancing the Company’s long-term value. We strive to employ company resources in ways that make positive contributions to our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. As we pursue improvements to our products and services, we keep in mind the environmental and societal impacts of our decisions and work to protect natural resources and the environment for the benefit of current and future generations. We continuously look for ways to improve our governance practices with the goal of promoting the long-term interests of stakeholders, strengthening accountability, and inspiring trust.
Environmental Stewardship. We take our commitment to reducing our own environmental impact seriously, as we recognize climate change is a challenge facing our business, industry, and communities today. We are committed to contributing to a more resource-efficient economy and embedding climate change mitigation into our business strategy to help confront challenges such as energy management, fuel economy and efficiency, and materials sourcing. We aim to operate our business in a manner that minimizes the impact on natural resources and the environment. We believe railcars are a more environmentally-friendly way to fuel the North American supply chain. U.S. freight railroads produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than certain other modes of commercial transportation, such as trucks. We strive to responsibly support customers' products at each stage of the product lifecycle, including recycling the railcar through scrap and salvage at the end of its useful life.
Social Responsibility. We actively engage stakeholders across our environmental, health and safety initiatives to continually improve processes and performance as we operate our businesses with a goal of zero injuries and incidents. Our goal is to add value to the communities in which we live and work, strengthening our relationships and leveraging our partnerships to amplify our impact. We strive to attract and retain a diverse and empowered workforce. Our priorities include fostering an inclusive and collaborative workplace, promoting opportunities for professional development, improving the well-being of our employees and other stakeholders, and contributing to the communities in which we operate. 
Governance. Our goal is to promote the long-term interests of stakeholders, strengthen accountability, and inspire trust. We have focused our governance practices to promote best-in-class leadership, diversity, independence and stockholder-aligned incentive practices at the most senior levels. Our Board of Directors includes an independent Chairman and diverse and independent Board members who help ensure that our business strategies and programs, including our compensation program, are aligned with stakeholder interests. Our Board of Directors and senior management teams are also committed to the Company’s continued respect for human rights throughout all our operations.
Green Financing Framework. As part of our sustainability efforts, TILC issued its Green Financing Framework in January 2021 supported by a second-party opinion from Sustainalytics, a Morningstar Company and a globally-recognized provider of environmental, social, and governance research, ratings, and data. The Green Financing Framework enhances the Company’s Sustainability strategy by contributing to a more resource-efficient economy through the financing of railcar assets that contribute to reducing the overall environmental footprint of the transportation industry.
In accordance with the International Capital Market Association's Green Bond Principles, 2018 and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association's Green Loan Principles, 2020, TILC will manage and report on eligible projects and assets to existing debt holders. The Green Financing Framework will enable Trinity’s leasing company to issue green financing instruments, including green non-recourse bonds and green loans, supported by green eligible railcar assets. Under the existing framework, TILC has issued over $4 billion of railcar-related debt that meets the criteria and qualifies for the Green Financing designation.
Governmental Regulation.
Railcar Industry. Our railcar and related manufacturing, maintenance services, and leasing businesses are regulated by multiple governmental regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA"); Transport Canada ("TC"); the U.S. Department of Transportation ("USDOT") and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA"), and the Research and Special Programs Administration; Mexico's Agencia Reguladora del Transporte Ferroviario; Mexico's Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes; and industry authorities such as the Association of American Railroads ("AAR"). All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications or operating standards affecting railcar design, configuration, and mechanics; maintenance, and rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment, tracks, and operations, including the packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials. We believe that our product designs and operations are in compliance with these specifications, standards, and regulations applicable to our business.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. Our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social ("STPS") in Mexico. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims asserted against us for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
Environmental Matters.
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and materials; and other activities relating to the protection of human health, natural resources, and the environment. 
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We believe that our operations and facilities, whether owned, managed, or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non-compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.
See Item 1A for further discussion of risk factors with regard to environmental, governmental, and other matters.
