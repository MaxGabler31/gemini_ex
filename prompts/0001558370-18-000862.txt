 Item 1. Business.
 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing potentially transformational medicines to improve the lives of patients with genomically defined cancers and rare diseases. Our approach is to leverage our novel target discovery engine to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and to craft highly selective and potent drug candidates that may provide significant and durable clinical responses for patients without adequate treatment options. This integrated biology and chemistry approach enables us to identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets that have been difficult to selectively inhibit. By focusing on diseases in genomically defined patient populations, we believe that we will have a more efficient development path with a greater likelihood of success.
 Our most advanced drug candidates are avapritinib (formerly known as BLU‑285), BLU‑554 and BLU‑667. Our lead drug candidate, avapritinib, is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets KIT and PDGFRα mutations. These mutations abnormally activate receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, and systemic mastocytosis, or SM. We are currently evaluating avapritinib in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for defined subsets of patients with GIST, which we refer to as the Navigator trial, and an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for advanced SM, which we refer to as the Explorer trial. GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma, or tumor of bone or connective tissue, of the gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract, and SM is a rare disorder that causes an overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs, which can lead to a wide range of debilitating symptoms and organ dysfunction and failure. 
 BLU‑554 is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets FGFR4, a kinase that is aberrantly activated in a defined subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, the most common type of liver cancer. We are currently evaluating BLU‑554 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC. 
 BLU‑667 targets RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is abnormally activated by mutations or translocations, and RET resistance mutations that we predict will arise from treatment with first generation therapies. RET drives disease in subsets of patients with non‑small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and cancers of the thyroid, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC, and papillary thyroid cancer, and our research suggests that RET may drive disease in subsets of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer and other cancers. We are currently evaluating BLU‑667 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RET‑altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors.
 In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we nominated a development candidate, BLU‑782, for our discovery program targeting the kinase ALK2 for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the ALK2 gene, ACVR1. We anticipate initiating IND‑enabling studies for BLU-782 in the first half of 2018.
 We plan to continue to leverage our discovery platform to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and craft drug candidates that potently and selectively target these kinases. We currently have two wholly-owned discovery programs for undisclosed kinase targets, and we anticipate nominating at least two additional discovery programs in 2018.
 In addition to our wholly-owned clinical and pre-clinical programs, in March 2016, we entered into an agreement with F. Hoffmann‑La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann‑La Roche Inc. to discover, develop and commercialize up to five small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. We will continue to evaluate additional collaborations that could maximize the value for our programs and allow us to leverage the expertise of strategic collaborators. We are also focused on engaging in collaborations to capitalize on our discovery platform outside of our primary strategic focus area of cancer.

 We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, BLU-554, BLU-667 and BLU-782 and all of our discovery programs other than the pre-clinical programs under the Roche collaboration. In September 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to BLU-554 for the treatment of HCC, and in January 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST and mastocytosis. In October 2016, the FDA granted fast track designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second tyrosine kinase, or TKI, inhibitor and for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRα D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In addition, in June 2017, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRα D842V mutation, and in July 2017, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST.
 Approved kinase drugs, such as imatinib, have demonstrated significant benefit to patients, and small molecule kinase drugs achieved approximately $25 billion in 2017 sales. Despite this success, there is room for further improvement in kinase drug discovery and development. Many of the approved drugs are multi‑kinase inhibitors that are not selective for disease drivers. This results in off‑target toxicities that limit dose levels and target inhibition, thereby reducing efficacy. Further, patients who initially respond to a targeted kinase treatment often relapse due to the development of resistance mutations. For many of the known kinases, there is a strong link between genomic alterations in a kinase and disease, including specific forms of cancer and rare genetic diseases. However, the function of the majority of the kinome is still unknown. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 35 small molecule drugs approved by the FDA that target less than five percent of the 518 kinases. Taken together, this represents a substantial opportunity for developing novel and transformative drugs for cancer, rare genetic diseases and other disease areas, including cancer immunotherapy.
 To capitalize on the kinase opportunity, we built a discovery platform that integrates a novel target discovery engine and a proprietary compound library. Our novel target discovery engine combines our expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, and cell and structural biology to provide new insights into the biology of kinases as drivers of disease. To develop kinase drugs, we start by interrogating our proprietary compound library. Our library is a unique collection of novel small molecules rationally designed and developed entirely in‑house by Blueprint Medicines’ scientists as kinase inhibitors and enriched for drug‑like properties. We do not owe any royalties or other fees to any parties associated with our novel target discovery engine and our proprietary compound library, other than any royalties or other fees that may become payable to Roche under our cancer immunotherapy collaboration. Using this discovery platform, we have produced a drug pipeline of several promising drug candidates that target genomically defined patient subsets. 
 Our Strategy    Our goal is to become a fully-integrated, biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering multiple transformative drugs to patients. The key tenets of our strategy include the following:

· | Rapidly advance the clinical development of avapritinib as a potential treatment for broad populations of GIST and SM, and if successful, seek global regulatory approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prepare for a potential commercial launch of avapritinib and build commercial capability to bring avapritinib and our other drug candidates, if and when approved, to physicians and patients for the approved indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rapidly advance BLU‑554, BLU-667 and BLU-782 through clinical development and define the potential regulatory path for these drug candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to expand our broad, differentiated pipeline of kinase drug candidates for patients with genomically defined cancers and rare diseases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evaluate potential strategic collaborations to maximize the value of our programs and platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain a commitment to Blueprint Medicines’ patient-focused and science-driven culture as we grow our business.

 Our Focus — Highly Selective Kinase Drugs for Genomically Defined Cancers and Rare Diseases
 Kinases are enzymes that function in many signaling pathways to regulate critical cellular functions. Kinase-dependent signaling networks are present in multiple different cell types, including muscle cells and cells of the immune system, and deregulation of these networks can lead to disease pathology. Abnormal activation of kinases has been shown to drive several key activities of cancer cells, including growth, survival, metabolism, cell motility and angiogenesis. Kinases may become abnormally activated through a number of mechanisms, including when: (1) a gene mutates creating a change in the resulting protein sequence; (2) chromosomes become rearranged creating a translocation or a fusion gene; or (3) excessive amounts of protein are created due to gene duplication or dysregulation leading to overexpression. There is a strong link between genomic alterations in kinases and disease, including specific forms of cancer and rare genetic diseases. Several kinases have been validated as oncogenes, which are genes that when altered can initiate and maintain cancer growth. Examples of oncogenes are ABL, EGFR, B‑RAF, ALK, BTK and JAK, among many others. Ongoing genomic analyses of tumor data sets continue to identify new roles for kinases as drivers of disease.
 Despite these successes, many opportunities remain in kinase drug discovery and development.

· | Identifying novel kinase drivers of disease. Very few kinases are the focus of approved drugs. Further, the function of the majority of the kinome still remains unexplored. Thus, there is substantial opportunity for developing novel and transformative therapies that target well‑characterized but currently difficult-to-drug kinases as well as KUBs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Crafting very selective kinase drugs. Due to the high degree of homology between kinases, specific targeting of a given kinase can be challenging. Many of the approved kinase drugs inhibit multiple kinases and are referred to as multi‑kinase inhibitors. Due to inhibition of off‑target kinases, these multi‑kinase inhibitors often give rise to severe unwanted effects, which can negatively impact the ability to dose patients at sufficient levels to achieve optimal efficacy. We believe increasing selectivity will minimize off‑target toxicities and will improve efficacy by enabling higher dose levels and greater target inhibition. Further, combination therapies require that the drugs have non‑overlapping toxicities, which could be minimized with more selective agents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Generating novel chemical matter required to target difficult‑to‑drug kinases. Novel chemical matter is needed to address targets that are known but have proven difficult-to-drug. Pharmaceutical companies generally rely on known chemical families as the basis of drug discovery programs. Consequently, the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies have similar compound libraries. New approaches are needed to develop novel chemistry and differentiated libraries that can inhibit difficult‑to‑drug kinases in alternate ways.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overcoming resistance mediated by the alteration of kinase targets. Most approved kinase inhibitors provide only temporary disease control. Patients may relapse due to the emergence of on-target resistance mutations. Novel approaches are needed to predict and inhibit resistant mutants thus providing more durable clinical responses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Approach and Platform
 Our approach is to systematically and reproducibly identify kinases that are drivers of diseases in genomically defined patient populations and to craft drug candidates that provide significant and durable clinical responses to patients. This approach enables us to drug known kinase targets that have been difficult to inhibit selectively and also identify, characterize and design drug candidates to inhibit novel kinase targets. By focusing on diseases in genomically defined patient populations, we believe that we can quickly identify the patients most likely to respond, resulting in a more efficient development path with a greater likelihood of success.
 Our approach is enabled by our drug discovery platform consisting of two pillars:

· | a proprietary, highly‑annotated library of novel compounds; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  5

 


· | a novel target discovery engine, which is a comprehensive process that interrogates kinase biology from many angles using genomics, structural biology and cell biology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our proprietary compound library is a unique collection of small molecules designed and developed entirely in‑house by Blueprint Medicines’ scientists as kinase inhibitors and enriched for drug‑like properties. We do not owe royalties or other fees to any parties associated with our novel target discovery engine and our proprietary compound library. This provides high‑quality compounds to start kinase drug discovery programs and to use in identifying new kinase targets. The compounds were designed as kinase inhibitors without specific targets in mind, a design strategy that yielded a diversity of novel chemical structures that provide access to unique chemical matter. Each compound has been extensively characterized for binding to over 450 kinases and disease‑relevant kinase mutants, and the majority of known kinases are targeted by at least one compound family. Thus, this “annotated” compound library provides high‑quality medicinal chemistry starting points that enable quick‑starts to drug discovery programs, avoiding the expense and time spent running high throughput screens. Notably, our proprietary compound library has yielded high quality chemical starting points for previously difficult‑to‑drug kinases. We have continued to expand our proprietary compound library to cover a significant portion of the kinome and anticipate that as part of our discovery efforts we will continue to increase the number of compound families that inhibit each kinase target.
 We have established a novel target discovery engine, which was developed entirely in‑house, to provide new insights into the biology of kinases as drivers of disease and to identify new kinase drug targets. There are two aspects to the novel target discovery engine:

· | Genomics Approach to Identify Novel Kinase Targets. Our high‑capacity computing infrastructure allows not only storage of very large genomic databases but also rapid analyses of these data using proprietary algorithms developed by our bioinformaticians. For example, using our proprietary kinase fusion detection algorithm to analyze human tumor sequences, we have identified both novel kinase fusions and new disease indications for several known kinase fusions. These results were published in Nature Communications in 2014.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cell‑based Screens to Identify Novel Kinase Targets. In this approach, a subset of the compounds in our proprietary compound library that exhibit remarkable potency and/or selectivity for one or a few kinases — our “tool compounds” — are used as probes in disease‑relevant cell‑based screens. Many of these tool compounds inhibit KUBs and thus allow us to evaluate potential roles for these relatively unexplored kinases in human disease.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Another aspect of our novel discovery engine is predicting resistance mutations. Through our structural and cell biology expertise, we predict mutations in kinases that render the enzyme insensitive to inhibition by an approved drug or compound in development. While treatment of patients with genomically defined cancers with a targeted therapy typically results in a significant anti‑tumor response, frequently the response is not durable. In tumors driven by an activated kinase, kinase reactivation via mutation is a common mechanism of resistance. Using our structural biology and computational chemistry expertise, we predict what changes in the kinase might result in a resistant enzyme and then confirm this prediction in a relevant cell culture model.

 Our Development Programs
 We have leveraged our discovery platform to develop a robust drug pipeline of orally available, potent and selective small molecule kinase inhibitors that target genomic drivers in several cancers and a rare genetic disease. We currently own worldwide development and commercial rights to all of our pre-clinical and clinical programs other than any drug candidates being developed in our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Roche. The following table summarizes our most advanced drug candidates as of February 15, 2018, each of which is described in further detail below.

     All of our current clinical programs target patient populations with genomically defined diseases. Generally, as we advance our drug candidates through Phase 1 clinical development, we enrich our clinical trials by selecting patients most likely to respond to our drug candidates to confirm mechanistic and clinical proof of concept. We are also collaborating with third parties to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for avapritinib in order to identify GIST patients with the PDGFRα D842V mutation, BLU‑554 in order to identify HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation and BLU-667 in order to identify NSCLC patients with RET fusions. We may collaborate with other third parties in the future to develop and commercialize additional companion diagnostic tests or to develop assays to measure target engagement, pathway modulation and early response.

      KIT and PDGFRα Inhibitor Program (avapritinib)
 Overview
 Avapritinib is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor that targets the homologous kinases KIT and PDGFRα, receptor tyrosine kinases that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders when abnormally activated. We specifically designed avapritinib to preferentially interact with the active conformation of KIT and PDGFRα to potently inhibit activation loop mutants not well-targeted by other agents, as well as a broad spectrum of other clinically relevant mutations. Avapritinib is able to potently and selectively inhibit both KIT and PDGFRα mutations with minimal inhibition of other kinases due to the high degree of structural similarity of the kinase domains of KIT and PDGFRα.

 We are initially developing avapritinib for PDGFRα-driven GIST and KIT-driven GIST, which we collectively refer to as advanced GIST, and for advanced SM. In addition, based on the preliminary safety and clinical activity data from our Phase 1 clinical trial for avapritinib for advanced SM to date, including evidence of clinical activity starting at the lowest dose level, we anticipate initiating a Phase 2 dose escalation and proof‑of‑concept clinical trial to evaluate avapritinib in patients with indolent SM, or ISM, and smoldering SM, or SSM, in the second half of 2018. We also plan to evaluate further development of avapritinib in additional diseases driven by KIT and PDGFRα.
 Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)
 GIST Disease Background
 GIST is a rare disease that is a sarcoma of the GI tract. Tumors arise within cells in the wall of the GI tract and occur most often in the stomach or small intestine. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 50‑80 with diagnosis triggered by GI bleeding, incidental findings during surgery or imaging, or in rare cases acute presentation due to tumor rupture or GI obstruction. The standard workup at primary presentation includes pathologic confirmation and imaging to assess extent of disease.
 The GIST treatment paradigm has advanced dramatically over the past 15 years. Patients diagnosed with localized disease undergo potentially curative tumor resection, while imatinib is given to high risk resected patients to prolong the time to recurrence. The advent of imatinib has improved the prognosis of patients with unresectable or metastatic disease to a five‑year median overall survival. Unresectable or metastatic patients typically receive imatinib, followed by sunitinib and regorafenib as the disease progresses.
 For patients with KIT‑driven GIST, current medical therapies slow the course of disease but progression is inevitable in most cases. Up to 50% of patients treated with frontline imatinib relapse within approximately 18 months. Of the secondary resistance mutations that lead to relapse, many of the mutations are not addressed by current therapies and confer mutations confer resistance to current treatments. A therapy that effectively suppresses a broad spectrum of KIT mutations and that is potentially amenable to combinations with existing agents is needed. 
 Patients with PDGFRα D842V‑driven GIST have great unmet medical need, as no approved medical therapies are effective. Progression can occur within as little as three months, and the median overall survival is 15 months for patients with advanced disease. 
 In the Major Markets, we estimate there are approximately 24,100 patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST, including approximately 7,700 patients with second line GIST and approximately 7,700 patients with third line or later GIST. The PDGFRα D842V mutation is found in 5‑6% of frontline unresectable or metastatic GIST patients, and we estimate there are approximately 500 patients with PDGFRα D842V‑driven GIST in the Major Markets. 
 KIT and PDGFRα Driver Mutations in GIST
 GIST is a tumor type that depends on continued signaling of a single, aberrantly active kinase. Most GISTs result from primary mutations in KIT or PDGFRα. Approximately 80% of patients have KIT‑driven GIST. Imatinib effectively inhibits most KIT primary mutations; however over time, secondary mutations occur elsewhere in the KIT gene that lead to kinase activation despite the presence of imatinib, thereby leading to disease progression. The most common mutation in the PDGFRα gene is D842V, found in approximately 5‑6% of frontline unresectable or metastatic GIST patients. There is currently no therapeutic option for patients with D842V mutant PDGFRα‑driven GIST. PDGFRα has a very similar active site structure to KIT, and the PDGFRα D842V mutation is homologous to KIT D816V. As in the case of KIT Exon 17 mutant receptors, PDGFRα D842V mutations confer ligand‑independent constitutive signaling of the mutant PDGFRα kinase.

 Pre‑clinical Development of avapritinib in GIST
 We have conducted comprehensive pre-clinical experiments to characterize the potency and selectivity of avapritinib. Avapritinib potently inhibits PDGFRα D842V in vitro (IC50 = 0.24 nM). In contrast, imatinib inhibits PDGFRα D842V at least 3,000‑fold less potently (IC50 = 759 nM). In a cellular model driven by an activated PDGFRα D842V mutant protein, avapritinib potently inhibits signaling of the oncogenic PDGFRα mutant protein as measured by inhibition of PDGFRα autophosphorylation (IC50 = 30 nM). By comparison, imatinib shows at least 100‑fold lower potency in the cellular model (IC50 = 3,145 nM). 
 We have also demonstrated significant anti‑tumor efficacy with avapritinib in an imatinib-resistant patient‑derived xenograft models with a KIT Exon 17 resistance mutation, similar to what is found in relapsed/refractory KIT‑driven GIST, as well as patient-derived xenograft models with KIT Exon 11 and KIT Exon 13 mutations. In these xenograft models, avapritinib administered orally for 25 days resulted in tumor regression at the two highest tested doses, which were well-tolerated. 

 Avapritinib elicits dose‑dependent tumor regression in a patient‑derived GIST xenograft model with a KIT Exon 11 mutation, KIT Exon 13 mutations and a KIT Exon 17 resistance mutation. In the figure above, QD means once a day and BID means twice a day.
 We recently presented pre-clinical data showing avapritinib is active across a broad spectrum of KIT and PDGFRα mutations, as shown in the figure below.

 | | IC50 (nM) 
 | | avapritinib | imatinib 
KIT Exon 11 deletion | JM domain mutations | 0.6 | 12 
KIT Exon 11 V560G | 1 | 87 
KIT Exon 11/13 | ATP binding site mutations | 11 | 9,160 
KIT Exon 11/14 | 28 | 19,650 
KIT Exon 17 | Activation loop mutations | < 2 | 60 – 12,750
KIT Exon 17 D816V | 0.27 | 8,150 
PDGFRα Exon 18 D842V | 0.24 | 759 

      In addition, we have developed an understanding of the biology that will inform the development of combinations to address these resistance mutations. We performed a comprehensive analysis of these secondary KIT Exon 17 mutations, analyzing the literature and unpublished data from opinion leaders to understand which mutations occur and to quantify their frequency in the clinical setting. We also conducted a series of in vitro biochemistry experiments using compounds from our proprietary compound library and currently available therapies (imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib) to interrogate their activity against the range of KIT Exon 17 mutations. The result is a deep understanding of the spectrum of activity of avapritinib, additional compounds from our proprietary compound library and available therapies across the range of possible mutations.

 Navigator Trial (avapritinib) – Phase 1 Clinical Trial for Patients with Advanced GIST
 Avapritinib is currently being evaluated in the dose expansion portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced GIST, which we refer to as the Navigator trial, and enrollment is ongoing. In November 2017, we reported updated data from the dose escalation and expansion portions of the Navigator trial at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society Annual Meeting. 
 As of the data cutoff date of October 11, 2017, 116 patients had been treated with avapritinib in the dose escalation and expansion portions of the Navigator trial at eight dose levels (ranging from 30 mg QD to 600 mg QD), including 76 patients with KIT‑driven GIST, 39 patients with PDGFRα‑driven GIST, and one patient with KIT/PDGFRα wild‑type GIST. The median number of prior TKI regimens was four for patients with KIT‑driven GIST (ranging from two to 11), and one for patients with PDGFRα‑driven GIST (ranging from zero to six). Among patients with KIT‑driven GIST, 64 patients (83%) previously received regorafenib. We have selected 300 mg QD as the RP2D for the expansion portion of the Navigator trial, with an option for investigators to escalate patients to the MTD of 400 mg QD following two treatment cycles.
 Safety Data. As of the data cutoff date, avapritinib was generally well‑tolerated. Most AEs reported by investigators were Grade 1 or 2. Across all grades, the most common treatment‑emergent AEs reported by investigators (≥20%) included nausea (56%), fatigue (53%), periorbital edema (43%), vomiting (41%), edema peripheral (34%), anemia (31%), diarrhea (31%), increased lacrimation (30%), cognitive effects (30%), decreased appetite (28%), dizziness (23%), constipation (22%) and hair color changes (22%). Cognitive effects are an aggregated category of individual cognitive events, each of which was observed in fewer than 20% of patients. Investigators reported treatment‑related Grade ≥3 AEs in 39 patients (34%), including anemia (9%), fatigue (7%), hypophosphatemia (4%), nausea (4%) and cognitive effects (3%). Six patients (5%) discontinued treatment with avapritinib due to AEs. An additional 43 patients discontinued treatment, with 40 patients due to progressive disease and three patients who withdrew consent. Among all 116 enrolled patients, 67 remained on treatment as of the data cutoff date.
 Clinical Activity Data. As of the data cutoff date, 30 patients with KIT‑driven GIST treated at 300 to 400 mg QD were evaluable for response assessments. In addition, 31 patients with PDGFRα D842‑driven GIST at all doses were evaluable for response assessments, including 29 patients with a D842V mutation and two patients with other D842 mutations. Two patients with a PDGFRα exon 14 mutation were excluded from analyses of clinical activity. Patients were evaluable if they had at least one centrally reviewed radiographic scan, and all reported data are based on blinded central radiology review as per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, or mRECIST 1.1 criteria, for GIST. Radiographic scans were also assessed by Choi criteria, a supportive method of response assessment in soft tissue sarcomas that has been shown to be predictive of improved prognosis in patients with advanced GIST.
 Patients with heavily pretreated KIT‑driven GIST treated at doses of 300 to 400 mg QD
 •Centrally assessed radiographic tumor reductions were observed in 20 of 30 evaluable patients (67%) across all common KIT genotypes, including mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, 14 and 17, confirmed by archival tumor biopsy and circulating tumor DNA.
 •By mRECIST 1.1 criteria, five patients had a PR (three confirmed, two pending confirmation), and 18 patients had SD, representing an ORR of 17% and a disease control rate, or DCR, of 77%.
 •By Choi criteria, 16 patients had a PR and seven patients had SD, representing an ORR of 53% and a DCR of 77%.
 •Median PFS was 11.5 months.

 Navigator Trial Design. The Navigator trial is designed to evaluate the activity, safety and tolerability of avapritinib in adults with advanced GIST. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion and a dose expansion portion. We have completed the dose escalation portion, and patient enrollment in the dose expansion portion of the Navigator trial is currently ongoing at the RP2D of 300 mg QD. The expansion portion of this trial is designed to enroll patients in the following cohorts: (1) patients with a PDFGRα D842V mutation, regardless of line of therapy, (2) patients who have received imatinib and at least one other TKI and (3) patients who have received imatinib and no other TKI. Primary objectives for the dose expansion portion of the Navigator trial include determining ORR by RECIST and the safety and tolerability of avapritinib across the three expansion cohorts. Secondary objectives include characterizing the PK of avapritinib, assessing anti-tumor activity by Choi criteria and allelic burden using circulating tumor DNA and comparing progression-free survival, or PFS, for avapritinib with PFS for each patient’s last prior anti-cancer therapy. All response assessments use blinded, central radiology review. The Navigator trial is designed to enroll approximately 250 patients, including approximately 50 patients during dose escalation and approximately 200 patients across all three expansion cohorts, at multiple sites in the United States, European Union and Asia.
 Clinical Development Plans
 In June 2017, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring the PDGFRα D842V mutation. In addition, in January 2016 the FDA granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST, and in October 2016, the FDA granted fast track designation to avapritinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST that progressed following treatment with imatinib and a second TKI inhibitor and for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with the PDGFRα D842V mutation regardless of prior therapy. In July 2017, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of GIST.

Based on feedback from the FDA at an end‑of‑Phase 1 meeting, additional data from the expansion portion of the Navigator trial may be sufficient to support a new drug application for avapritinib for the treatment of PDGFRα D842V‑driven GIST. We currently expect to complete enrollment of the PDGFRα D842V expansion cohort for the Navigator trial by the middle of 2018, and we have completed enrollment of the third line or later expansion cohort of the Navigator trial. We plan to report updated data from the Navigator trial in the following patient populations in 2018: PDGFRα-driven GIST, second line KIT-driven GIST and third line or later KIT-driven GIST. In addition, we plan to initiate a global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial for avapritinib compared to regorafenib in third‑line GIST in the first half of 2018, which we refer to as the Voyager trial. 
 In addition, in August 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third party to develop and commercialize an assay as a companion diagnostic test to identify GIST patients with the PDGFRα D842V mutation for use with avapritinib. We are also working with patient advocacy groups relevant to GIST in order to:

--+------------------------------------------------


· | identify and use existing patient registries to identify patients for rapid enrollment; and

 Systemic Mastocytosis (SM)
 SM Disease Background
 SM is a disorder of the mast cells, the key effector cells of allergic inflammation, which have several physiologic roles including wound healing, regulation of vascular and epithelial permeability and immune cell recruitment. The signature of SM is the overproduction of mast cells and the accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs. In advanced forms of SM, abnormal mast cells may also accumulate in the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract and bones. Mast cell activation and histamine release can lead to severe allergic symptoms ranging from a skin rash to hives, fever and anaphylaxis, while mast cell accumulation in advanced cases of SM can eventually lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
 SM comprises a spectrum of disease, with approximately 90-95% of patients having a KIT D816V mutation, the underlying driver of disease for most SM patients. The diagnosis, which is usually made in adulthood, involves a complex diagnostic algorithm that begins with confirmation of SM and subsequently categorizes patients into indolent or advanced subtypes of disease, a classification that has prognostic significance as shown below. Patients with ISM have a normal life expectancy. The primary burden of disease for ISM patients is the range of often unpredictable and debilitating allergic symptoms due to mast cell activation. Advanced SM includes three subsets with increasingly severe impact on life expectancy: aggressive SM, or ASM, advanced SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, SM-AHN, and mast cell leukemia, or MCL. These advanced forms of SM have a median overall survival of three to five years and are characterized by prominent organopathy and dysfunction, as well as symptoms of mast cell activation. SSM is increasingly considered as a variant of advanced SM. While SSM is not known to affect life expectancy, it has a greater degree of bone marrow infiltration, myeloproliferation and/or presents with an enlarged liver and bears a greater risk of progression to ASM, SM-AHN or MCL.

Pardanani, Blood, 121(16):3085 ‑ 3094 (2013); permission conveyed through Copyright Clearance Center, Inc. In the figure above, AHD refers to SM-AHN.
 Population studies, including a population‑based epidemiology study that we sponsored, based on the Danish National Health Registry, estimate the incidence of all subtypes of SM from 0.5 to 1/100,000 new patients per year. This represents approximately 3,200 new patients diagnosed per year in the United States. Of all SM patients, ISM accounts for 50‑80% of patients, and advanced SM accounts for the remaining 20‑50% of patients.
 The current treatment paradigm for SM varies by disease subtype. Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies that address SM patients with the KIT D816V mutation. Midostaurin, which was approved in April 2017 by the FDA for the treatment of advanced SM, is a multi-kinase inhibitor with KIT D816V inhibitory activity and imatinib does not address patients with the KIT D816V mutation. For patients with advanced and smoldering forms of SM, treatments include interferon‑alpha or cytoreductive agents to reduce mast cell burden or treatments aimed at addressing the associated blood disorder. Patients with advanced SM typically have a three to five‑year overall survival prognosis. In the Major Markets, we estimate there are approximately 2,600 patients with advanced SM.

 For ISM, management is symptom‑directed and includes avoidance of triggers of mast cell activation (such as insect stings). Treatments for ISM include histamine blockers, cromolyn, epinephrine, and, in cases of refractory patients, cytoreductive agents. Within ISM, key opinion leaders see the greatest degree of unmet need for the fraction of patients who have a heavy symptom burden that current therapies fail to address. Based on the preliminary safety and clinical activity data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with advanced SM to date, including evidence of clinical activity starting at the lowest dose level, we anticipate initiating a Phase 2 dose escalation and proof‑of‑concept clinical trial to evaluate avapritinib in patients with ISM and SSM in the second half of 2018. In the Major Markets, we estimate that there are approximately 16,300 patients with ISM and approximately 1,800 patients with SSM.
 KIT Driver Mutations in SM
 In all subtypes of SM, the mast cells of approximately 90-95% of patients display an activating mutation at the D816V position in KIT. KIT D816V status is routinely assessed as part of the workup in SM diagnosis.
 KIT signaling is needed for normal blood cell production, including the differentiation and survival of mast cells. In patients with SM, abnormal mast cells bearing the KIT D816V mutation undergo constitutive kinase activation, leading to continuous survival and proliferative signals. Rare cases of SM have been found where alternative mutations in KIT occur that are responsive to imatinib. In these cases, treatment with imatinib can reduce mast cell burden in the bone marrow and other organs and improve symptoms, thereby clinically validating KIT as a therapeutic target for SM.
 Pre‑clinical Development of avapritinib in SM
 We conducted comprehensive biochemical and cellular experiments to characterize the potency and selectivity of avapritinib. Avapritinib potently inhibits KIT D816V in vitro (IC50, or the compound concentration at which 50% of the activity is inhibited relative to control lacking compound, = 0.27 nM). In contrast, imatinib inhibits KIT D816V at least 10,000‑fold less potently (IC50 > 8,000 nM). In several cellular models driven by activated KIT mutant proteins, avapritinib potently inhibits signaling of the oncogenic KIT mutant protein, as measured by inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation and inhibition of cellular proliferation. In HMC 1.2 cells, a human mast cell leukemia model driven by the KIT D816V mutation, avapritinib potently inhibits signaling of the mutant KIT protein as measured by inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation (IC50 = 4 nM). In contrast, imatinib inhibits KIT autophosphorylation at least 2,000‑fold less potently. In P815 cells, a mouse mastocytoma model driven by an Exon 17 mutation, avapritinib potently inhibits signaling of the mutant KIT protein as measured by inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation (IC50 = 22 nM) as well as cellular proliferation (IC50 = 202 nM). By comparison, imatinib shows considerably lower cellular potency in the P815 model. 

KIT D816V Inhibition
 | Biochemical | Cellular 
IC50 (nM) | KIT D816V | HMC1.2 P-KIT | P815 P-KIT | P815 Prolif. 
avapritinib | 0.27 | 4 | 22 | 202 
Imatinib | 8,150 | 9,229 | 1,235 | 2,811 

      Potency of avapritinib against KIT D816 and other Exon 17 mutations compared to imatinib. The inhibitory potencies of avapritinib and imatinib against the KIT D816V mutant protein were evaluated in an in vitro enzyme activity assay. The inhibitory potencies of avapritinib and imatinib were also evaluated in two cell lines harboring KIT Exon 17 mutations, HMC 1.2 cells and P815 cells. Inhibition of KIT cellular signaling was measured by inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation (P‑KIT). Inhibition of cellular proliferation was also measured in P815 cells.
 The selectivity of avapritinib was further evaluated by profiling avapritinib at a concentration of 3 µM across a panel of over 450 kinases and disease‑relevant kinase mutants using KINOMEscan methodology. Avapritinib demonstrated exquisite selectivity for KIT Exon 17 mutant proteins and PDGFRα D842V in this assay, binding significantly (greater than 90% inhibition relative to control) to only 12 other kinases. We also profiled midostaurin, a multi‑kinase inhibitor with KIT D816V inhibitory activity (an inhibitory activity not present in imatinib). Midostaurin demonstrated significant binding (greater than 90% inhibition relative to control at 3 µ M) to 118 kinases, as indicated by the number of dots on the kinome tree shown below. We believe multi‑kinase inhibitors like midostaurin may not achieve full inhibition of KIT D816V due to poor selectivity and the resulting dose limitations imposed by off‑target toxicities.

 Explorer Trial (avapritinib) – Phase 1 Clinical Trial for Patients with Advanced SM
 Avapritinib is currently being evaluated in the dose expansion portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced SM, which we refer to as the Explorer trial, and enrollment is ongoing. In December 2017, we reported updated data from the dose escalation portion of the Explorer trial at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.
 As of the data cutoff date of October 4, 2017, 32 patients had been treated with avapritinib in the dose escalation portion of the Explorer trial at seven dose levels (ranging from 30 mg once daily, or QD, to 400 mg QD), including 17 patients with aggressive SM, or ASM, nine patients with advanced SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, or SM‑AHN, three patients with mast cell leukemia, or MCL, and two patients with SSM. The KIT D816V mutation was confirmed in 28 patients. Overall, 22 patients (69%) previously received anti‑neoplastic therapy, including four patients (13%) who previously received midostaurin.
 Based on pharmacokinetic, or PK, data, avapritinib demonstrated a mean half‑life of greater than 20 hours, supporting a QD dosing regimen.
 We have selected 300 mg QD as the recommended part two dose, or RP2D, for the expansion portion of the Explorer trial, which was initiated in the second quarter of 2017. A maximum tolerated dose of avapritinib in advanced SM was not determined.
 Safety Data. As of the data cutoff date, avapritinib was generally well‑tolerated. Most adverse events, or AEs, reported by investigators were Grade 1 or 2. As of the data cutoff date, the most common treatment‑emergent AEs reported by investigators (≥20%) across all grades included periorbital edema (59%), fatigue (41%), peripheral edema (34%), nausea (28%), anemia (28%), thrombocytopenia (28%), abdominal pain, diarrhea, respiratory tract infection, dizziness and headache (22% each). Investigators reported treatment‑related Grade ≥3 AEs in 16 patients (50%), with only one treatment‑related Grade ≥3 AE occurring in more than 10% of patients (neutropenia, 13%).
 No patients discontinued treatment due to a treatment‑related AE. Two patients discontinued treatment with avapritinib, including one patient with ASM who had progressive disease with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and one patient with SM‑AHN and no identified KIT mutation (i.e., wild‑type KIT). Overall, 30 of 32 patients enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the Explorer trial remained on treatment as of the data cutoff date, with a median duration of 9 months (range 4 to 19 months).
 Clinical Activity Data. The International Working Group‑Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment and European Competence Network on Mastocytosis, or IWG‑MRT‑ECNM, criteria comprise a rigorous assessment of clinical response in patients with advanced SM. These criteria include objective measures of bone marrow mast cell burden, serum tryptase and improvement in organ damage as measured by a clinical improvement, or CI, finding.

 
  15

 

 As of the data cutoff date, 18 patients had advanced SM and were evaluable for response by the IWG‑MRT‑ECNM criteria.
 Across all 18 evaluable patients with advanced SM, the data showed an objective response rate, or ORR, of 72% and a complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) rate of 56%. A detailed summary of response data is provided below.

 Results from individual components of the IWG‑MRT‑ECNM were reported as of the data cutoff date. Clinically meaningful improvements were observed in all evaluable patients, across all subtypes of advanced SM and at all avapritinib dose levels evaluated.

· | All 32 enrolled patients had decreases in serum tryptase greater than 50%.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All 25 patients who had bone marrow mast cell infiltrate of at least 5% at baseline (measured by bone marrow biopsy) showed decreases in bone marrow mast cell burden. In this group, 21 patients had at least a 50% decrease, and 15 patients achieved a CR for bone marrow mast cell burden.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All 25 patients with centrally reviewed radiographic scans showed decreases in spleen volume. In this group, 14 patients had at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, rash improved in 13 of 15 patients with urticaria pigmentosa at baseline, based on investigator assessments. Urticaria pigmentosa is an allergy‑mediated rash common in SM patients.
 Explorer Trial Design. The Explorer trial is designed to evaluate the activity, safety and tolerability of avapritinib in adults with advanced SM. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion and an expansion portion. We have completed the dose escalation portion, and patient enrollment in the dose expansion portion of the Explorer trial is currently ongoing at the RP2D of 300 mg QD. The expansion portion of this trial is designed to enroll patients with specific subtypes of advanced SM in the following cohorts: (1) patients with aggressive SM, (2) patients with an associated hematological neoplasm and (3) patients with mast cell leukemia. Primary objectives for the Explorer trial include assessing safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives include assessing response per IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria and additional clinical outcome measures of mast cell burden, organ function and disease symptoms. The Explorer trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients, including approximately 25 patients during dose escalation and approximately 35 patients across all three expansion cohorts, at multiple sites in the United States and the European Union.
 Clinical Development Plans    In January 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to avapritinib for the treatment of mastocytosis. Based on the data reported in December 2017, we plan to engage global regulatory authorities in the first half of 2018 to obtain input on registration pathways for avapritinib in patients with advanced SM and patients with ISM and SSM. We anticipate initiating a registration‑enabling Phase 2 clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with advanced SM in the first half of 2018 and a Phase 2 dose escalation and proof‑of‑concept clinical trial of avapritinib in patients with ISM and SSM in the second half of 2018. In addition, we continue to enroll patients in the expansion portion of the ongoing Explorer trial with the goal of generating additional data in 2018.

 
  16

 

 As there is currently no validated patient reported outcome, or PRO, tool for SM, we are collaborating with a health research outcomes group to develop a disease-specific PRO tool to measure changes in total symptom burden in patients with advanced SM. We also plan to develop a similar PRO tool for use in clinical trials in patients with indolent and SSM. In addition, we continue to collaborate with patient advocacy groups to recruit patients to join a patient registry, which we launched in December 2015 with the goals of improving understanding of SM and increasing patient participation in SM clinical trials.
 FGFR4 Inhibitor Program
 Overview
 BLU‑554 is an orally available, potent, selective and irreversible inhibitor of the kinase FGFR4. FGFR4 functions as a receptor whose aberrant activation is a driver of HCC. FGFR4 belongs to a family of highly homologous receptors, which include FGFR1‑4. BLU‑554 targets FGFR4, while sparing the other three FGFR paralogs, and demonstrates exquisite kinome selectivity. Pre‑clinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy data provides a strong rationale for the development of BLU‑554 for the subset of HCC patients whose tumors are driven by aberrant FGFR4 signaling. We estimate that approximately 30% of patients with HCC have tumors with aberrantly activated FGFR4 signaling, which we refer to as FGFR4-activated HCC. HCC Disease Background
 Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer‑related deaths worldwide, and HCC accounts for most liver cancers. The highest incidence of HCC occurs in regions with endemic hepatitis B virus, or HBV, including Southeast Asia and sub‑Saharan Africa. In the United States, HCC is the fastest rising cause of cancer‑related death. Over the past two decades, the incidence of HCC has tripled while the five‑year survival rate has remained below 12%.
 Cirrhosis is a key risk factor for HCC — the disease etiology varies by geography with the common theme of chronic conditions that lead to cirrhosis. In North America, the main risk factors for cirrhosis are infection with hepatitis C virus, or HCV, followed by HBV infection, alcohol consumption and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In the European Union, the main risk factors for cirrhosis are HCV, HBV and alcohol consumption. In Asia and sub‑Saharan Africa, the major risk factor is chronic HBV infection.
 The diagnosis of HCC is typically made in adults, peaking around age 70. Disease management is complicated by concurrent liver disease, which often compromises liver function in these patients. Patients are staged depending on extent of liver disease, performance status and liver function status; these factors guide treatment selection. The stage distribution at diagnosis varies by region. Countries with active national screening programs, such as Taiwan and Japan, tend to diagnose many more patients in the early stages of disease. There are currently no treatments for molecularly defined patient subgroups in HCC.
 Despite advances in the treatment of HCC, including recent approval of nivolumab and prior approvals of the multi-kinase inhibitors sorafenib and regorafenib, the prognosis for patients with advanced HCC remains poor and there is a significant unmet need for new treatments for HCC, including FGFR4-driven HCC. Patients diagnosed at an early stage receive potentially curative transplant, resection or ablative therapies. Treatments for intermediate to advanced stage patients include high‑dose chemotherapy delivered directly to the liver (transarterial chemoembolization), sorafenib, nivolumab and regorafenib. Sorafenib, which is approved as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC, is a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR and many other kinases and exhibits anti-angiogenic effects. In a pivotal trial conducted primarily at European Union and U.S. sites, sorafenib improved median overall survival by approximately three months, and 2% of patients responded. Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD-1, which received accelerated approval from the FDA in September 2017 for second-line advanced HCC based in data from a pivotal clinical trial showing a 14% object response rate in patients who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib. Regorafenib is approved as a second-line treatment for advanced HCC based on data from a pivotal trial showing improved median overall survival of 2.8 months and an 11% objective response rate in patients with documented progression following sorafenib. In clinical practice, patients often require dose modifications or discontinue therapy with sorafenib and regorafenib due to tolerability issues. There is a clear need for medical therapies with a favorable risk‑benefit profile and the potential be used alone or in combination with other approved or emerging therapies for advanced HCC.

 FGFR4 as a Driver in HCC
 The link between aberrant FGFR4 signaling and HCC was first established when an amplicon, a region of replicated DNA, that includes FGF19, the ligand that activates FGFR4, was identified in HCC patients. We estimate that more than 5% of tumors of HCC patients have this amplicon. The physiologic role of the receptor, FGFR4, and its ligand, FGF19, is to regulate bile acid metabolism in hepatocytes and liver regeneration following injury. FGF19 is normally produced in the small intestine and signals to hepatocytes through an endocrine mechanism. FGF19 forms an active signaling complex together with FGFR4 and its co‑receptor Klotho‑β. Signaling of the active complex leads to decreased CYP7A1 transcription with a resultant decrease in bile acid synthesis, as well as increased growth, proliferation and survival signals.
 FGFR4 Signaling in the Liver

 In the figure above, HBV means hepatitis B virus, HCV means hepatitis C virus, NASH means non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and KLB means Klotho‑β.
 Subsequent data suggest that FGFR4 signaling is a driver in a subset of HCC patients in whom the pathway is aberrantly activated. In these patients, FGF19 is overexpressed in hepatocytes (which do not normally express FGF19), leading to autocrine signaling and tumor growth. Pre‑clinical experiments in a genetically engineered mouse model demonstrate that exogenous FGF19 expression is sufficient to induce liver tumor growth and that tumorigenesis is dependent on FGFR4. The three elements that constitute an active FGFR4 signaling complex, FGF19, FGFR4 and Klotho‑β, are expressed together uniquely in HCC, although it is possible that they may also occur in rare cases of other solid tumors.
 We have used our novel drug discovery platform to identify a potentially broader target responder population in addition to the FGF19‑amplified patient population. We estimate that approximately 25% of HCC tumors overexpress FGF19 without amplification. We have also demonstrated a significant anti‑tumor response with an FGFR4 inhibitor in an HCC patient‑derived xenograft model that overexpresses FGF19 in the absence of amplification. Some of these results were published in Cancer Discovery in 2015. We estimate that approximately 30% of patients have FGFR4-activated HCC, and data suggest patients with HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation resulting in activation of the FGFR4 pathway generally have poor outcomes relative to other HCC patients. 
 The FGFR4 signaling pathway is a promising new driver for the development of molecularly targeted therapy in HCC. In the Major Markets, we estimate there are approximately 28,100 first and second line patients with FGFR4-activated HCC.

 BLU-554 Pre-clinical Development in HCC
 Efforts to discover selective, reversible inhibitors of FGFR4 have been challenging given the high sequence similarity among the four FGFR paralogs. A cysteine located near the ATP binding site in FGFR4 is unique among the paralogs. We therefore focused on developing a covalent inhibitor with paralog specificity and kinome selectivity. Our team of experienced medicinal chemists applied structure‑based design principles to develop a potent and selective FGFR4 inhibitor starting from known FGFR inhibitor templates. This effort yielded our development candidate, BLU‑554. We have conducted comprehensive in vitro experiments to characterize the potency and selectivity of BLU‑554. BLU‑554 potently inhibits FGFR4 enzyme activity (IC50 = 5 nM) and inhibits the activity of FGFR1‑3 at least 100‑fold less potently (IC50 ≥ 600 nM). In contrast, pan‑FGFR inhibitors such as BGJ‑398 fail to exhibit paralog specificity. The selectivity of BLU‑554 was further evaluated by profiling BLU‑554 at a concentration of 3 µM across a panel of over 450 kinases and disease relevant kinase mutants using KINOMEscan methodology. BLU‑554 displayed significant binding (greater than 90% inhibition relative to control) only to FGFR4 in this assay. In contrast, BGJ‑398 significantly bound to 14 kinases (greater than 90% inhibition relative to control).

 Paralog selectivity of BLU-554 compared to the pan-FGFR inhibitor BGJ-398. The inhibitory potency of BLU-554 and BGJ-398 against each of the FGFR paralogs was evaluated in an in vitro enzyme activity assay.

The degree of binding corresponds to the size of the circle. Kinome illustration reproduced courtesy of CSTI (www.cellsignal.com).

 We demonstrated significant anti-tumor efficacy with BLU‑554 in two in vivo HCC xenograft models where tumor growth is driven by FGFR4 signaling. BLU‑554 administered orally for 21 days resulted in robust and dose‑dependent growth inhibition of Hep3B tumors, an FGF19‑amplified model. At a dose of 100 mg/kg BID, a well‑tolerated dose, BLU‑554 induced complete remission in a subset of mice for at least 30 days after cessation of treatment. We observed a correlation between the concentration of BLU‑554 in mouse plasma and the level of expression of CYP7A1, a downstream biomarker, in the tumor. At the 100 mg/kg BID dose, significant induction of CYP7A1 expression was seen, which is an expected consequence of inhibiting FGFR4 signaling. This correlation between BLU‑554 plasma concentration, the level of induction of CYP7A1 expression and anti‑tumor efficacy supports that the observed anti‑tumor response is due to inhibition of FGFR4 signaling.

 BLU‑554 elicits dose‑dependent tumor inhibition in the Hep3B tumor xenograft mouse model, a model of FGF19 amplification. In the figure above, BID means twice a day and PO means orally.
 Aberrant FGFR4 signaling can also be driven by FGF19 overexpression in the absence of amplification. Hence, we have also evaluated the anti‑tumor efficacy of BLU‑554 in a patient‑derived xenograft model driven by FGF19 overexpression in the absence of amplification. Treatment with BLU‑554 led to dose‑dependent tumor growth inhibition. The anti‑tumor efficacy of sorafenib, the only approved systemic treatment for HCC, was also evaluated in this study. Sorafenib dosed once daily at 40 mg/kg, a dose that led to body weight loss in the mice, had only a modest effect on tumor growth.

 BLU‑554 elicits dose‑dependent tumor inhibition in a patient‑derived tumor xenograft mouse model in which tumor growth is driven by FGF19 overexpression in the absence of FGF19 amplification. In the figure above, QD means once a day, BID means twice a day and PO means orally.
 Taken together, the data presented above indicate that potent and selective FGFR4 inhibition leads to robust anti‑tumor effects in in vivo models where tumor growth is driven by FGF19 amplification or FGF19 overexpression in the absence of amplification. 
 These findings, together with our estimate that approximately 30% of patients with HCC have tumors with aberrantly activated FGFR4 signaling, provide critical information to identify a potential responder population and informed patient selection criteria in our Phase 1 clinical trial. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial for Patients with Advanced HCC
 BLU‑554 is currently being evaluated in the dose expansion portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced HCC at the MTD of 600 mg QD, and enrollment is ongoing. In October 2017, we presented updated data from this ongoing clinical trial at European Society of Medical Oncology 2017 Congress. 
 As of the data cutoff of August 18, 2017, 77 patients had been treated with BLU‑554 in the dose escalation and expansion portions of the Phase 1 clinical trial at five dose levels (ranging from 140 mg QD to 900 mg QD), including 44 patients with FGFR4-activated HCC. FGFR4-activated HCC was defined as at least one percent tumor expression of FGF19, the FGFR4 ligand, as measured by an immunohistochemistry, or IHC, assay. In general, the enrolled population was heavily pretreated: 82% received prior TKI treatment, 23% received prior immunotherapy and 91% received prior systemic therapy. PK analysis demonstrated rapid oral absorption across all dose levels, with a mean half‑life of 

 
  20

 
approximately 17 hours and exposure in the expected therapeutic range based on HCC xenograft models. Collectively, we believe that these data support a once‑daily dosing regimen.
 Safety Data. As of the data cutoff of August 18, 2017, the majority of AEs reported by investigators were Grade 1 or 2. Across all grades, the most common AEs reported by investigators related to BLU‑554 included diarrhea (71%), nausea (42%), vomiting (36%), transaminase elevation (AST 34% and ALT 32%) and fatigue (29%). Grade 3 or higher AEs related to BLU‑554 occurring in five or more patients included anemia, diarrhea and transaminase elevation (AST and ALT). Among all 77 patients treated with BLU‑554, 58 patients discontinued treatment with BLU‑554, including 42 patients due to disease progression, 11 patients due to treatment‑related AEs, three patients who withdrew consent and two patients due to the investigator’s decision.
 Clinical Activity Data. As of the data cutoff of August 18, 2017, 67 patients were evaluable for response assessment. An additional 10 patients were treated with BLU‑554 as of the data cutoff date but were not evaluable for response assessment. Response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, or RECIST, version 1.1.
 In patients with FGFR4-activated HCC (n=38), the data showed an ORR of 16% (95% confidence interval 6‑31%). In addition, 49% of patients had radiographic tumor reduction, and clinical activity was observed regardless of disease etiology or geography. As of the data cutoff date:

· | One patient had an unconfirmed complete response.
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Five patients had a partial response, with four confirmed and one unconfirmed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An additional 20 patients had stable disease, representing a disease control rate of 68%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No responses were observed in patients without FGFR4 pathway activation (n=29).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Among all 77 patients treated with BLU‑554, 19 remained on treatment as of the data cutoff date, including 15 patients with FGFR4-activated HCC. Median progression-free survival was 3.7 months among patients with FGFR4-activated HCC.
 In addition, five TKI‑naïve patients with FGFR4-activated HCC were evaluable for response assessment as of the data cutoff date. Within this group, preliminary evidence of prolonged disease control was observed. Two TKI‑naïve patients remain on treatment as of the data cutoff date with a duration of treatment of 11.4 months and 12.3 months, respectively.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Design. This Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BLU-554 in adults with advanced HCC. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion and an expansion portion. We have completed the dose escalation portion, and patient enrollment in the dose expansion portion is currently ongoing at the MTD of 600 mg QD. The expansion portion of the trial is designed to enroll patients in the following cohorts: (1) three subsets of patients with HCC, regardless of prior therapy, and (2) patients with FGFR4-activated HCC who have not been previously treated with a TKI, which we refer to as the TKI-naïve cohort. The primary objective of the expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial is to continue to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BLU-554. Secondary objectives include assessing clinical activity by RECIST version 1.1, as well as evaluating the PK of BLU-554 and pharmacodynamic markers of BLU-554 activity. The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to enroll approximately 150 patients, including approximately 40 patients during dose escalation and approximately 110 patients across both expansion cohorts, at multiple sites in the United States, European Union and Asia.
 Clinical Development Plans

In September 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to BLU‑554 for the treatment of HCC. We plan to report updated data from the expansion portion of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for advanced HCC, including preliminary data from the TKI‑naïve cohort, in the second half of 2018. We also plan to explore opportunities to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate BLU‑554 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

 RET Program
 Overview
 BLU-667 is an orally available, potent selective inhibitor of the kinase RET, including activating RET fusions and mutations and predicted RET resistance mutations. RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. RET can be activated by mutation or when a portion of the RET gene that encodes the kinase domain is joined to part of another gene creating a fusion gene that encodes an aberrantly activated RET fusion protein. RET activating mutations are implicated in MTC (approximately 60% of patients), and RET fusions are implicated in several cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (approximately 10% of patients) and NSCLC (1‑2% of patients). Our genomics analyses on the landscape of kinase fusions, published in Nature Communications in 2014, identified RET fusions in breast and colon cancer patient samples (both <1% of patients), providing a therapeutic rationale for the use of RET inhibitors in multiple patient subpopulations.
 The identification of RET fusions as drivers in some cancers prompted the use of approved multi‑kinase inhibitors with RET inhibitory activity to treat patients whose tumors express a RET fusion protein. However, we believe these drugs cannot be dosed at levels required to sufficiently inhibit RET due to toxicities that result from inhibition of the primary targets. For example, currently approved therapies such as vandetanib and cabozantinib demonstrate lower objective response rates and duration of response in patients with RET-altered NSCLC compared to selective kinase inhibitors targeting other kinase drivers such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1.
 Further, one of the greatest challenges in treating cancer is the ability of tumor cells to become resistant to therapy. Kinase reactivation via mutation to evade small molecule inhibition is a common mechanism of resistance. We have predicted future resistance mutations of drugs with RET inhibitory activity. Thus, there is a clear need for a selective RET inhibitor that targets both oncogenic RET fusions and activating mutations and their predicted RET resistance mutations. In the Major Markets, we estimate there are approximately 10,200 patients with RET-driven NSCLC and approximately 780 patients with RET-driven MTC. 
 BLU-667 Pre-Clinical Development in RET 
 BLU-667 was specifically designed to target oncogenic RET fusions and activating mutations and predicted RET resistance mutations, while sparing anti-targets such as VEGFR-2. We have conducted pre-clinical experiments in biochemical and cellular assays to characterize the potency of BLU-667 against these targets. In a panel comparing BLU-677 with the commonly used multi-kinase inhibitors cabozantinib and vandetanib and the development candidate RXDX-105, BLU-667 was the only compound to demonstrate sub-nanomolar selectivity for wild-type RET and predicted resistance mutations at the gatekeeper (V804) residue. In addition, BLU-667 selectivity was assessed in a biochemical screen of a broad panel of over 350 kinases and demonstrated approximately 90-fold selectivity for wild-type RET over VEGFR-2.

 | Biochemical IC50 (nM) | IC50 Ratio (VEGFR-2 / RET)
--------------+-----------------------+---------------------------
Wild-type RET | RET V804L | RET V804M | RET M918T | CCCDC6-RET | VEGFR-2
BLU-667 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 35 | 88x 
cabozantinib | 11 | 45 | 162 | 8 | 34 | 2 | 0.2x
vandetanib | 4 | 3597 | 726 | 7 | 20 | 4 | 1x 
RXDX-105 | 3 | 188 | 102 | 4 | 7 | 17 | 6x 

      Potency of BLU-667 against wild‑type RET, predicted RET resistant mutants and the anti-target VEGFR-2 compared to a panel of multi‑kinase inhibitors with RET inhibitory activity. The inhibitory potencies of BLU-667 and the multi‑kinase inhibitors against wild‑type RET, RET resistant mutants and VEGFR2 were evaluated in in vitro enzyme activity assays. The inhibitory potencies of these compounds were also evaluated in cell lines driven by either a wild‑type RET fusion or a mutant RET fusion.
 We have demonstrated significant anti‑tumor efficacy with BLU-667 in both a KIF5b-RET fusion allograft and a KIF5b-RET (V804L) resistant mutant allograft. Administration of BLU-667 orally twice daily for 14 days in a 

 
  22

 
wild‑type RET fusion allograft and for 14 days in a predicted RET resistant mutant allograft resulted in robust and dose‑dependent tumor growth inhibition. At a dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily, a well‑tolerated dose, the compound induced tumor regression in both models. The anti‑tumor efficacy of a multi‑kinase inhibitor with RET inhibitory activity that is being evaluated in the clinic for treatment of patients with RET fusion positive lung cancer (reference compound) was also evaluated in these models. This reference compound, dosed orally once daily at 60 mg/kg, a well‑tolerated dose, inhibited tumor growth in the wild‑type RET fusion allograft. At the same dose level in the RET resistant mutant allograft, this reference compound showed diminished inhibition of tumor growth.
     BLU-667, a RET inhibitor, elicits dose dependent tumor growth inhibition in both a KIF5b-RET fusion allograft (left figure)) and a KIF5b-RET (V804L) resistant mutant allograft model (right figure). In the figure above, BID means twice a day, and QD means once a day.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial for Patients with RET-Altered NSCLC, MTC and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
 BLU‑667 is currently being evaluated in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with RET‑altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors, and enrollment is ongoing. As of December 1, 2017, 30 patients had been enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the trial. BLU‑667 has been generally well‑tolerated to date, and the majority of AEs reported by investigators were Grade 1. We have not identified an MTD or RP2D. Investigators have reported preliminary evidence of clinical activity in patients with NSCLC, including patients with KIF5B and other RET fusions, and RET‑altered MTC. We plan to report preliminary data from this clinical trial and initiate the expansion portion in the first half of 2018.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Design. This Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BLU-667 in multiple ascending doses in adults with RET-altered NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors. The trial consists of two parts: a dose escalation portion and an expansion portion. The goal of the dose escalation portion is to establish an MTD or a recommended dose if the MTD is not achieved. Once the MTD is reached or a recommended dose is established, we plan to open expansion cohorts for the following four patient groups: (1) NSCLC patients with a RET rearrangement who have undergone prior treatment with a TKI that inhibits RET, (2) NSCLC patients with a RET rearrangement who have not been previously treated with a TKI that inhibits RET, (3) patients with MTC and (4) patients with RET-altered solid tumors, other than NSCLC and MTC. Secondary objectives for this trial include assessing the PK profile of BLU-667, assessing RET gene status in plasma and tumor tissue, characterizing the PD of BLU-667 and assessing response rate by RECIST. The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to enroll approximately 115 patients, including approximately 35 patients during dose escalation and approximately 80 patients across all four expansion cohorts, at multiple sites in the United States and the European Union. 
 Collaboration with Roche 
 In March 2016, we entered into the Roche agreement pursuant to which we and Roche have agreed to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of up to five small molecule therapeutics targeting kinases believed to be important in cancer immunotherapy, as single products or possibly in combination with other therapeutics. The parties are currently conducting activities for up to five programs under the collaboration, including up to two collaboration programs leveraging our novel target discovery engine and proprietary compound library to select potential targets.

 
  23

 

 Under the Roche agreement, Roche is granted up to five option rights to obtain an exclusive license to exploit products derived from the collaboration programs, or licensed products, in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Such option rights are triggered upon the achievement of Phase 1 proof-of-concept. For up to three of the five collaboration programs, if Roche exercises its option, Roche will receive worldwide, exclusive commercialization rights for the licensed products. For up to two of the five collaboration programs, if Roche exercises its option, we will retain commercialization rights in the United States for the licensed products, and Roche will receive commercialization rights outside of the United States for the licensed products. We will also retain worldwide rights to any products for which Roche elects not to exercise its applicable option. Prior to Roche’s exercise of an option, we will have the lead responsibility for drug discovery and pre-clinical development of all collaboration programs. In addition, we will have the lead responsibility for the conduct of all Phase 1 clinical trials other than those Phase 1 clinical trials for any product in combination with Roche’s portfolio of therapeutics, for which Roche will have the right to lead the conduct of such Phase 1 clinical trials. Pursuant to the Roche agreement, the parties will share the costs of Phase 1 development for each collaboration program. In addition, Roche will be responsible for post-Phase 1 development costs for each licensed product for which it retains global commercialization rights, and we and Roche will share post-Phase 1 development costs for each licensed product for which we retain commercialization rights in the United States.
 We received an upfront cash payment of $45.0 million in March 2016 upon execution of the Roche agreement, and subject to the terms of the Roche agreement, we will be eligible to receive up to approximately $965.0 million in contingent option fees and milestone payments related to specified research, pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestones. Of the total contingent payments, up to approximately $215.0 million are for option fees and milestone payments for research, pre-clinical and clinical development events prior to licensing across all five potential collaboration programs, including contingent milestone payments for initiation of each of the collaboration programs for which the parties will work together to select targets. In addition, for any licensed product for which Roche retains worldwide commercialization rights, we will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from low double-digits to high-teens on future net sales of the licensed product. For any licensed product for which we retain commercialization rights in the United States, we and Roche will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single-digits to low double-digits on future net sales in the other party’s respective territories in which it commercializes the licensed product. The upfront cash payment and any payments for milestones, option fees and royalties are non-refundable, non-creditable and not subject to set-off.
 Under the Roche agreement, each party has granted the other party specified intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Roche agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Roche agreement. Following Roche’s exercise of its option with respect to the collaboration programs for which it will obtain worldwide rights, we will grant Roche an exclusive license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize the licensed products generated through such collaboration program. Similarly, Roche will grant us an exclusive license under Roche’s intellectual property to develop and commercialize licensed products in the United States for the collaboration programs on which we will retain rights in the United States, with Roche receiving a license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize such licensed products outside of the United States. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Roche agreement, we have agreed to work exclusively with Roche with respect to each collaboration target, and we have agreed to work exclusively within the field of cancer immunotherapy for a period of up to 30 months after the execution of the Roche agreement. In addition, subject to specified exceptions, Roche has a right of first negotiation in the event that we desire to grant any third party rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product under either of the collaboration programs for which we will retain commercialization rights in the United States. Roche’s right of first negotiation will not apply in connection with a change of control of us, an assignment by us in accordance with the terms of the Roche agreement or certain agreements with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, academic institutions, not-for-profit third parties or distributors. 
 The Roche agreement will continue until the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Roche agreement. Prior to its exercise of its first option, Roche may terminate the Roche agreement at will, in whole or on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis, upon 120 days’ prior written notice to us. Following its exercise of an option, Roche may terminate the Roche agreement at will, in whole, on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis, on a collaboration program-by-collaboration program basis or, if a licensed product has been commercially sold, on a country-by-country basis, (i) upon 120 days’ prior written notice if a licensed product has not been commercially sold or (ii) upon 180 days’ prior 

 
  24

 
written notice if a licensed product has been commercially sold. Either party may terminate the Roche agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency and in certain other circumstances agreed to by the parties. In certain termination circumstances, we are entitled to retain specified licenses to be able to continue to exploit the licensed products.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, including avapritinib, BLU‑554, BLU-667 and BLU-782, and our core technologies, including our novel target discovery engine and our proprietary compound library, and other know‑how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.
 We file patent applications directed to our drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding these new chemical entities as well as uses of these new chemical entities in the treatment of diseases. We also file patent applications directed to novel fusions that we have discovered through our target discovery engine and the use of these fusions in diagnosing and treating disease. As of February 15, 2018, we owned ten issued U.S. patents, 25 pending U.S. patent applications, 5 pending U.S. provisional applications, 87 foreign patent applications pending in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, three issued foreign patents, and nine pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications. Our pending patent applications pertain to our key research and development programs, specifically our programs for avapritinib, BLU-554, BLU-667 and BLU-782, and our pipeline, specifically novel recurrent fusions. Our issued U.S. patents are projected to expire between 2033 and 2034, and any patents that may issue from our pending U.S. applications would be projected to expire between 2034 and 2037.
 The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced drug candidates as of February 15, 2018 are summarized below. Each of these portfolios is in its early stages and, with respect to some of the pending patent applications covering our drug candidates, prosecution has just begun or is in progress. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.
 Avapritinib (KIT and PDGFRα)
 The intellectual property portfolio for our avapritinib program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for avapritinib and analogs, compositions of matter for KIT inhibitors with different compound families, as well as methods of use for these novel compounds. As of February 15, 2018, we owned five issued US patents, four pending U.S. patent applications, 36 pending foreign patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico New Zealand, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan and Venezuela, one pending PCT patent application and two U.S. provisional applications directed to our KIT and PDGFRα program, including avapritinib. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patents issuing from the pending applications covering avapritinib will have a statutory expiration date of October 2034. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 BLU-554 (FGFR4)
 The intellectual property portfolio for our BLU-554 program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for BLU‑554 and analogs, as well as compositions of matter for FGFR4 inhibitors with multiple compound families. The portfolio also includes patent applications directed to methods of use for the novel compounds as well as patent applications directed broadly to FGFR4 selective inhibitors. As of February 15, 2018, we owned four issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, one pending U.S. provisional application, one pending PCT international application, 41 foreign patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico New Zealand, Russia, South Africa and Taiwan, and three issued foreign patents directed to our FGFR4 program, including BLU-554. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patent issuing 

 
  25

 
from the pending applications covering BLU-554 will have a statutory expiration date of July 2033, December 2033, October 2034 or September 2037. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 BLU-667 (RET)
 The intellectual property portfolio for our BLU-667 program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for BLU-667 and analogs, compositions of matter for other inhibitors of predicted RET resistance mutations and methods of use for these novel compounds. As of February 15, 2018, we owned five pending U.S. patent applications, four pending PCT applications, six pending foreign patent applications filed in Argentina, Lebanon, Uruguay and Taiwan, and one pending provisional U.S. patent applications directed to our RET program, including BLU-667, which, if issued, will have statutory expiration dates of 2036 or 2037.
 BLU-782 (ALK2)
 The intellectual property portfolio for our BLU-782 program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for BLU-782 and analogs, compositions of matter for other inhibitors with different compound families and methods of use for these novel compounds. As of February 15, 2018, we owned one pending U.S. patent application, one pending U.S. provisional patent application and one pending PCT international application directed to our ALK2 program, including BLU-782, which, if issued, will have statutory expiration dates of April 2037 or October 2038.
 Platform
 The intellectual property portfolio directed to our platform includes patent applications directed to novel gene fusions and the uses of these fusions for detecting and treating conditions implicated with these fusions. As of February 15, 2018, we owned ten pending U.S. patent applications and ten pending European Union patent applications directed to this technology, which, if issued, will have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2034 to 2035.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non‑provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. See “— Government Regulation — U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity” below for additional information on such exclusivity. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third‑party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.

 
  26

 

 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non‑competition, non‑solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights.
 With respect to the building of our proprietary compound library, we consider trade secrets and know‑how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know‑how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to our discovery platform, these trade secrets and know‑how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and other rare genetic diseases. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the field of kinase inhibition for cancer and other diseases. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostic tests in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 If our drug candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently conducting or planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in development.
 avapritinib
 We are initially developing avapritinib, which is designed to target KIT and PDGFRα mutations, for patients with advanced GIST and advanced SM. If avapritinib receives marketing approval for advanced SM, it will face competition from Novartis AG’s midostaurin, a multi-kinase inhibitor with KIT D816V inhibitory activity that was 

 
  27

 
approved in April 2017 by the FDA for the treatment of advanced SM. If avapritinib receives marketing approval for third line advanced GIST, it will face competition from Bayer AG’s regorafenib, and if avapritinib receives marketing approval for second line advanced GIST, it will face competition from Pfizer Inc.’s sunitinib. In addition, if avapritinib receives marketing approval for advanced SM, GIST and/or for GIST patients with the PDGFRα D842V mutation, it may face competition from other drug candidates in development for these indications, including drug candidates in development by AB Science S.A., ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, AROG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Plexxikon Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited. 
 BLU‑554
 We are initially developing BLU‑554 for patients with advanced HCC driven by FGFR4. If BLU-554 receives marketing approval for patients with FGFR4-activated HCC, it will face competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which was approved in September 2017 by the FDA for the treatment of HCC, as well as sorafenib and regorafenib, multi-kinase inhibitors for the treatment of HCC. In addition, BLU-554 may face competition from other drug candidates in development by Abbisko Therapeutics Co., Ltd, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Celgene Corporation, Eisai Inc., H3 Biomedicine Inc., Incyte Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis AG, Sanofi S.A., Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., U3 Pharma GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, and Xoma Ltd. 
 BLU‑667
 We are initially developing BLU‑667 for patients with RET-driven NSCLC, MTC and other advanced solid tumors. If BLU-667 receives marketing approval for RET-driven NSCLC, MTC or other advanced solid tumors, it may face competition from drug candidates in development by Loxo Oncology, Inc. and Mirati Therapeutics, as well as several approved multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity being evaluated in clinical trials, including alectinib, apatinib, cabozantinib, dovitinib, lenvatinib, ponatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetinib. 
 BLU‑782
 We are initially developing BLU‑782 for patients with FOP. If BLU-782 receives marketing approval for FOP, it may face competition from drug candidates in development by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Commercialization Plans
 Our goal is to become a fully‑integrated biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering transformative drugs to patients. Given our stage of development, we have started to establish our own commercial organization and distribution capabilities. Our initial focus is on genomically defined patient populations in oncology and a rare disease, which we believe will allow us to efficiently commercialize our drug candidates in the United States on our own initially and worldwide longer‑term. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to avapritinib, BLU-554, BLU-667 and BLU-782 and all of our discovery programs other than the pre-clinical programs under the Roche collaboration. Subject to obtaining regulatory approval, we believe that we may be able to commercialize one or more of our drug candidates in as little as five years from when we select a development candidate. In addition, subject to regulatory approval, we believe we can successfully launch and commercialize our initial drug candidates on our own, using a small and highly specialized sales force similar to those of other rare disease companies. However, we may establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to leverage their capabilities to maximize the potential of our drug candidates.
 Under the terms of our agreements related to the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests, third parties are responsible for the commercialization of companion diagnostic tests for avapritinib in order to identify GIST patients with the PDGFRα D842V mutation, BLU‑554 in order to identify HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation and BLU-667 in order to identify NSCLC patients with RET fusions.

 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, or drug substance for avapritinib, BLU‑554, BLU-667 and BLU-782 for our pre-clinical and Phase 1 testing from one third‑party manufacturer and drug product from two third party manufacturers. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have a long‑term supply arrangement in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for API, drug product or drug substance. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the API, drug product and drug substance prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA and/or a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency.
 Our drug candidates avapritinib, BLU‑554, BLU-667 and BLU-782 are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale‑up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue developing drug candidates that can be produced cost‑effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 Under the terms of our agreements related to the development and commercialization of companion diagnostic tests, we will rely on third parties to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for avapritinib in order to identify GIST patients with the PDGFRα D842V mutation, BLU‑554 in order to identify HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation and BLU-667 in order to identify NSCLC patients with RET fusions. We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any other companion diagnostic tests we may seek to develop.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the regulatory authority’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, debarment, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
· | completion of extensive nonclinical tests, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  29

 


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be actively maintained, including by submitting annual reports;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial‑related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical study sites and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non‑human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the pre-clinical data, general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30‑day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non‑compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers and/or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials for oncology indications generally involve a small number of disease-affected patients who are treated with the drug candidate in escalating dose cohorts. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to determine the MTD, or a recommended dose if the MTD is not achieved, assess the PK profile, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 1 clinical trials for oncology indications may also evaluate preliminary evidence of clinical activity. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in 

 
  30

 
disease‑affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug and provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a drug during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 Post‑approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any finding from other clinical studies, tests in laboratory animals, or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long term stability and quality of the final drug product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA Review Process
 Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the drug and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure drug quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain adequate evidence of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fiscal year 2018 fee schedule, 

 
  31

 
effective through September 30, 2018, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $2,421,495. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($304,162). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. In addition, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non‑orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drugs or drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re‑analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new drug to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials by inspecting the sponsor or clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the drug labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post‑market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved drugs. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved drugs that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of drugs. Drug 

 
  32

 
approvals may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and based on pre-clinical or preliminary clinical data demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 In addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life‑threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post‑marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.

 Pediatric Trials
 A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. Development program candidates designated as orphan drugs are exempt from the above requirements. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed‑upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
 Post‑Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company and the approved drug are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”) and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off‑label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off‑label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. There are also limitations on industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities. Modifications or enhancements to the drug or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. Any distribution of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.
 In the United States, once a drug is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our drugs in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute drugs manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a drug after approval may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the drug from the market, and may require substantial resources to correct.
 The FDA also may require post‑approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and post‑marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. The distribution of 

 
  34

 
pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record‑keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs.
 Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
 Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act. If drugs are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child‑resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recalls, seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record‑keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review 

 
  35

 
an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven‑year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six‑month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA‑issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the European Commission, after receiving the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. In addition, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.
 In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 We expect that our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostic tests, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. For example, we have entered into agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for avapritinib in order to identify GIST patients with the PDGFRα D842V mutation, BLU‑554 in order to identify HCC patients with FGFR4 pathway activation and BLU-667 in order to identify NSCLC patients with RET fusions. In the 

 
  36

 
United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic test developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic test device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic test device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
 In the EEA, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the E.U. Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low‑risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA.
 European Drug Development
 In the European Union, our future drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.

 
  37

 

 Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the current EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Clinical Trials Directive, has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, which is set to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation will apply by October 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 European Drug Review and Approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto‑immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk‑benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

 European Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third‑party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third‑party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third‑party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third‑party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies 

 
  39

 
for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third‑party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point‑of‑sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TJCA, includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, on January 20, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating these subsidies, but on October 25, 2017, a federal judge in California denied their request for a restraining order. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through these marketplaces. There may be further action to repeal, replace or modify the Affordable Care Act. While any legislative and regulatory changes will likely take time to develop, and may or may not have an impact on the regulatory regime to which we are subject, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and 

 
  40

 
pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has enforced the Anti‑Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti‑kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers.
 In addition, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi‑million and multi‑billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which publicly posts the data on its website. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health 

 
  41

 
information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Employees
