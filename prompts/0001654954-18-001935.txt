  Overview
 
 RumbleOn, Inc., a Nevada corporation, operates a capital light disruptive e-commerce platform facilitating the ability of both consumers and dealers to Buy-Sell-Trade-Finance pre-owned vehicles in one online location. Our goal is to transform the way pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most efficient, timely and transparent transaction experience. Our initial focus is the market for vin specific pre-owned vehicles with an initial emphasis on motorcycles and other powersports.
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”), we refer to RumbleOn, Inc., formerly Smart Server, Inc., as “RumbleOn,” “RMBL,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” and similar words.
 
 Serving both consumers and dealers, through our online marketplace platform, we make cash offers for the purchase of pre-owned vehicles. In addition, we offer a large inventory of pre-owned vehicles for sale along with third-party financing and associated products. Our operations are designed to be scalable by working through an infrastructure and capital light model that is achievable by virtue of a synergistic relationship with our regional partners, consisting of dealers and auctions. We utilize regional partners in the acquisition of pre-owned vehicles as well as to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution services. Correspondingly, we earn fees and transaction income, while our regional partners earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales and fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs.
 
  Our business model is driven by a technology platform we acquired in February 2017, through our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NextGen Dealer Solutions, LLC (“NextGen”). The acquired system provides integrated vehicle appraisal, inventory management, customer relationship and lead management, equity mining, and other key services necessary to drive the online marketplace. Over the past 16 years, the developers of the software have designed and built, for large multi-national clients, a number of dealer and, what we believe to be, high quality applications solutions.
 
  Our business combines a comprehensive online buying and selling experience with a vertically-integrated supply chain solution that allows us to buy and sell high quality vehicles to and from consumers and dealers transparently and efficiently at a value-oriented price. Using our website or mobile application, consumers and dealers can complete all phases of a pre-owned vehicle transaction. Our online buying and selling experience allows consumers to:
 
   ●
 Sell us a vehicle. We address the lack of liquidity available in the market for a cash sale of a vehicle by consumers and dealers through our cash offer to buy program. Dealers and consumers can sell us a vehicle independent of a purchase. Using our free and simple appraisal tool, consumers and dealers can receive a haggle-free, guaranteed 3-day firm cash offer for their pre-owned vehicle within minutes and, if accepted, receive prompt payment. Our cash offer to buy is based on the use of extensive pre-owned retail and wholesale vehicle market data. When a consumer accepts our offer, we ship their vehicles to our closest regional partner where the vehicle is inspected, reconditioned and prepared for pending sale. We believe buying pre-owned vehicles directly from consumers is the primary driver of our source of supply for sale and a key to our ability to offer competitive pricing to buyers. By being one of the few online sources for consumers to receive cash for their vehicle, we have a significant opportunity to buy product at a lower cost since dealer and auction markup is eliminated from these consumer purchases. In addition, we believe our willingness to provide cash offers and purchase a customer’s vehicle sight unseen, whether or not the customer is buying a vehicle from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for vehicles.


   ●
 Purchase a pre-owned vehicle. Our 100% online marketplace approach to retail consumer and dealer distribution addresses the many issues currently facing the consumer and dealer distribution marketplace for pre-owned vehicles, a marketplace we believe is primed for a disruptive change. We believe the issues facing the marketplace include: (i) heavy use of inefficient listing sites, (ii) a highly fragmented dealer network; (iii) a limited selection of high quality pre-owned vehicles for sale; (iv) negative consumer perception of the current buying experience; and (v) a massive consumer shift to online retail. We offer consumers and dealers a large selection of pre-owned vehicles at a value-oriented price that can be purchased in a seamless transaction in minutes. In addition to a transparent buying experience, our no haggle pricing, coupled with an inspected, reconditioned and certified vehicle, backed by a fender-to-fender warranty and a 3-day money back guarantee, addresses consumer dissatisfaction with the current buying processes in the marketplace. As of December 31, 2017, including vehicles of our dealer partners, we have 751 pre-owned vehicles listed for sale on our website, where consumers can select and purchase a vehicle, including arranging financing, directly from their desktop or mobile device. Selling pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers is the key driver of our business.

   ●
 Finance a purchase. Customers can pay for their vehicle using cash or we will provide a range of finance options from unrelated third parties such as banks or credit unions. Customers fill out a short online application form, and, if approved, apply the financing to their purchase.


   ●
 Protect a purchase. Customers have the option to protect their vehicle with unrelated third-party branded Extended Protection Plans (“EPPs”) and vehicle appearance protection products as part of our online checkout process. EPPs include extended service plans which are designed to cover unexpected expenses associated with mechanical breakdowns and guaranteed asset protection, which is intended to cover the unpaid balance on a vehicle loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. Vehicle appearance protection includes products aimed at maintaining vehicle appearance.


 To enable a seamless consumer and dealer experience, we are building a vertically-integrated pre-owned vehicle supply chain marketplace, supported by proprietary software systems and data which include the following attributes:
 
   ●
 Vehicle sourcing and acquisition. We acquire virtually all of our pre-owned vehicle inventory directly from consumers and dealers. Using pre-owned retail and wholesale vehicle market data obtained from a variety of internal and external data sources, we evaluate a significant number of vehicles daily to determine their fit with consumer demand, internal profitability targets and our existing inventory mix. The supply of pre-owned vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including: the total number of vehicles in operation; the rate of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate pre-owned vehicles; and the number of pre-owned vehicles sold or remarketed through our consumer and dealer channels. Based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year, consumer acceptance of our cash offer to buy, and the large size of the United States market relative to our needs, we believe that sources of pre-owned vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.


   ●
 Inspection, reconditioning and logistics. After acquiring a vehicle, we transport it to one of our closest regional partners who are paid to perform an inspection and to recondition the vehicle to meet “RumbleOn Certified” standards. High quality photographs are then taken, the vehicle is listed for sale on Rumbleon.com and the regional partner stores the vehicle pending delivery to the buyer. This process is supported by a custom pre-owned vehicle inventory management system, which tracks vehicles through each stage of the inspection, reconditioning and logistic process. The ability to leverage and provide a high margin source of incremental revenue to the existing network of regional partners in return for providing inspection, reconditioning, logistics and distribution support reduces our need for any significant investment in retail or reconditioning facilities.


  Corporate History
 
 RumbleOn, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada in October 2013 as a development stage company under the name Smart Server, Inc. In July 2016, Berrard Holdings Limited Partnership (“Berrard Holdings”) acquired 5,475,000 shares of common stock of the Company from the prior owner of such shares pursuant to an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, dated July 13, 2016. The shares acquired by Berrard Holdings represented 99.5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Steven Berrard, a director and our Chief Financial Officer, has voting and dispositive control over Berrard Holdings. The aggregate purchase price of the shares was $148,141. In addition, at the closing, Berrard Holdings loaned the Company, and the Company executed a promissory note, in the principal amount of $191,858 payable to Berrard Holdings. Effective August 31, 2017, the note was amended to increase the principal amount by $5,500 to $197,358 in aggregate amount payable to Berrard Holdings.
 
 In October 2016, Berrard Holdings sold an aggregate of 3,312,500 shares of the Company’s common stock to Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other purchasers. The 2,412,500 shares acquired by Mr. Chesrown represented 43.9% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The remaining shares owned by Berrard Holdings after giving effect to the transaction represented 39.3% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
 On November 28, 2016, the Company completed a private placement with certain purchasers, with respect to the sale of an aggregate of 900,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.50 per share for total consideration of $1,350,000 (the “2016 Private Placement”). In connection with the 2016 Private Placement, the Company also entered into loan agreements, pursuant to which the purchasers would loan to the Company their pro rata share of up to $1,350,000 in the aggregate upon the request of the Company at any time on or after January 31, 2017 and before November 1, 2020.
 
 On January 8, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “NextGen Agreement”) with NextGen, Halcyon Consulting, LLC (“Halcyon”), and members of Halcyon signatory thereto (“Halcyon Members,” and together with Halcyon, the “Halcyon Parties”) pursuant to which NextGen agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets of NextGen in exchange for a payment of approximately $750,000 in cash, the issuance to NextGen of 1,523,809 unregistered shares of Company common stock (the “Purchaser Shares”), the issuance of a subordinated secured promissory note issued by the Company in favor of NextGen in the amount of $1,333,333 (the “Acquisition Note”) and the assumption by the Company of certain specified post-closing liabilities of NextGen under the contracts being assigned to the Company as part of the transaction (the “NextGen Acquisition”). On February 8, 2017, the Company assigned to NextGen Pro, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“NextGen Pro”), the right to acquire NextGen’s assets and liabilities (but not any other rights or obligations under the NextGen Agreement).

 On January 9, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and stockholders holding 6,375,000 of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to change the name Smart Server, Inc. to RumbleOn, Inc. and to create an additional class of Company common stock. The Certificate of Amendment became effective on February 13, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), after the notice and accompanying Information Statement describing the amendment was furnished to non-consenting stockholders of the Company in accordance with Nevada and Federal securities law.
 
 Immediately before approving the Certificate of Amendment, the Company had authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (the “Authorized Common Stock”), including 6,400,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Outstanding Common Stock,” and together with the Authorized Common Stock, the “Common Stock”). Pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, the Company designated 1,000,000 shares of Authorized Common Stock as Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Common Stock”), which Class A Common Stock ranks pari passu with all of the rights and privileges of the Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and (ii) all other shares of Common Stock, including all shares of Outstanding Common Stock were deemed Class B Common Stock (the “Class B Common Stock”), which Class B Common Stock are identical to the Class A Common Stock in all respects, except that holders of Class B Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding.
  
 On January 9, 2017, the Company’s Board and stockholders holding 6,375,000 of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock approved the issuance to (i) Mr. Chesrown of 875,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Chesrown, and (ii) Mr. Berrard of 125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Berrard.
 
 Also, on February 8, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), RumbleOn and NextGen Pro completed the NextGen Acquisition in exchange for approximately $750,000 in cash, the Purchaser Shares, the Acquisition Note, and the other consideration described above. The Acquisition Note matures on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Maturity Date”). Interest accrues and will be paid semi-annually (i) at a rate of 6.5% annually from the Closing Date through the second anniversary of such date and (ii) at a rate of 8.5% annually from the second anniversary of the Closing Date through the Maturity Date. The Company’s obligations under the Acquisition Note are secured by substantially all the assets of the NextGen Pro pursuant to an Unconditional Guaranty Agreement (the “Guaranty Agreement”), by and among NextGen and NextGen Pro, and a related Security Agreement between the parties, each dated as of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Guaranty Agreement, NextGen Pro has agreed to guarantee the performance of all of the Company’s obligations under the Acquisition Note.
 
  On March 31, 2017, we completed funding of the second tranche of the 2016 Private Placement. The purchasers were issued 1,161,920 shares of Class B Common Stock and notes in the aggregate principal amount of $667,000, (the “Private Placement Notes”), in consideration of cancellation of loan agreements having an aggregate principal amount committed by the purchasers of $1,350,000. 
 
 Also on March 31, 2017, we completed the sale of 620,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, at a price of $4.00 per share for aggregate proceeds of $2,480,000 in a private placement offering, (the “2017 Private Placement.”) We sold an additional 37,500 shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with the 2017 Private Placement on April 30, 2017. Our officers and directors acquired 175,000 shares of Class B Common Stock in the 2017 Private Placement. Proceeds from the 2017 Private Placement were used to complete the launch of our website, acquire vehicle inventory, continue development of our platform, and for working capital purposes.
 
 On October 23, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering (the “2017 Public Offering”) of 2,910,000 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock at a price of $5.50 per share for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $14.5 million. In connection with the 2017 Public Offering, on October 19, 2017, the Class B Common Stock uplisted from the OTCQB and began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “RMBL.”
 
  Our Strategy
 
 RumbleOn’s strategy is to provide a 100% online supply chain marketplace solution for the retail distribution of pre-owned vehicles to consumers and dealers, while providing regional partners access to software solutions and services allowing them to earn incremental revenue and enhance profitability through increased sales leads, and fees earned from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. The recognition of the need for the RumbleOn solutions is the result of our management team gaining a clear understanding of the key drivers of complete supply chain solutions to create a different and disruptive way to both acquire and distribute pre-owned vehicles online from their deep experience in the automotive sector with disruptive businesses such as: AutoNation™, Auto America™, and Vroom™. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to disrupt the pre-owned marketplace in powersports and recreational vehicles as it suffers from many of the same negative consumer sentiments and dealer practices that existed in the automotive sector prior to the advent of and the significant influx of new entrants with improved business models. In addition, the powersports and recreation vehicle segment lacks the significant competition that exists in the automotive sector due to its fragmented dealer network, relative size and the niche nature of its products. Management believes consumers prefer to transact through a well-designed simple online/mobile solution, with a broad selection of pre-owned vehicles at highly competitive prices. RumbleOn applications provide a cash offer financing options and logistics/delivery solutions designed to provide an exceptional consumer experience. We intend to replicate and improve upon the positive attributes of the various “Sell us your car” and other related programs that have proven successful in automotive retail for entities such as AutoNation™, CarMax™, Carvana™, Vroom™ and others.

 RumbleOn’s regional partner strategy is focused on creating a synergistic relationship wherein regional partners have the ability to leverage the RumbleOn online marketplace and partner services offerings to drive increased revenue through the purchase or sale of pre-owned vehicles via the online marketplace platform and the ability to earn fees from inspection, reconditioning and distribution programs. Regional partners have the ability to show the complete RumbleOn vehicle inventory on their website and have access to preferred pricing on the acquisition of vehicles. We intend to add additional regional partners to our network and we are currently in discussions with a number of other potential partners regarding joining the network. We believe that our operations, designed to be both capital and infrastructure light, will leverage the regional partner network to provide inspection, reconditioning and distribution, thus minimizing the number of warehouse locations, reconditioning centers and logistics facilities we operate. We plan to primarily operate a centralized headquarter, call center, and limited number of strategically located warehouses as needed.
 
 RumbleOn’s initial focus was on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles as it provided a targeted, identifiable segment to establish the functionality of the platform and the RumbleOn brand. Harley-Davidson is a highly regarded and dominant brand (representing approximately 50% market share of new 601cc+ on-road motorcycles according to both Harley-Davidson public filings and the Motorcycle Industry Council) in the motorcycle market, with a base of over three million pre-owned motorcycles registered for use in the United States. According to Harley-Davidson, as disclosed in their 2017 investor meeting presentation, and management estimates, each year approximately 400,000 pre-owned Harley-Davidsons are sold, with Harley-Davidson dealers selling approximately 125,000 units, 250,000 units sold in private consumer and independent dealer transactions, and 25,000 sold via other means. As our business has evolved we have expanded into other powersports and recreational vehicle with a strong emphasis on the “metric” brands of motorcycles (Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, etc.) which essentially doubles the available market and is a natural extension as these vehicles are often sold or traded for Harley-Davidson vehicles. The metric market and dealer profile closely mirror that of the Harley-Davidson market although it is more highly fragmented and the average pre-owned vehicle selling price is less than a pre-owned Harley Davidson. In addition, many of the metric dealers also retail other powersport vehicles including ATVs, UTVs, snowmobiles and personal watercraft providing RumbleOn an opportunity for product extensions by leveraging existing regional partner relationships.
 
  Our Growth Strategy
 
 We intend to transform the way pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold and thereby significantly grow our business and gain market share by targeting the large number of private consumer transactions driven by listing only sites such as Craigslist. Management believes a significant number of pre-owned vehicle transactions are completed on a peer to peer basis. We believe these transactions are highly inefficient and consumers view the process as cumbersome. Our online consumer direct sourcing strategy, wherein we make a cash offer to a consumer or dealer utilizing our website or mobile application allows us to deliver value pricing on our vehicles for sale. We believe our large-scale inventory of pre-owned vehicles for sale, coupled with our 100% online marketplace platform, transparent selling process, certified and reconditioned pre-owned vehicles and ability to offer financing and ancillary products provides a unique customer experience as compared to current alternatives when purchasing a pre-owned vehicle. We believe we can aggressively drive RumbleOn brand recognition and awareness at a relatively low expense by utilizing digital, social media and guerrilla marketing techniques, as there are few national competitors and consumers are very brand focused and loyal. For example, approximately 15 key motorcycle events, such as Daytona Bike Week and the Sturgis Bike Rally, attract millions of attendees annually, many of whom are motorcycle and other powersport and recreational vehicle enthusiasts. We intend to have a significant presence at these type of events, with onsite advertising and sales facilities to build brand awareness. In addition, we anticipate engaging with or sponsoring powersport groups, providing us a targeted audience to which to market RumbleOn and showcase the ease with which they can buy, sell, or trade a vehicle online. Once powersports and recreational vehicle enthusiasts have sampled our website, we believe the unique experience will be compelling and drive organic growth. Over time, management believes we will build a proprietary database of customers and their interests, which will facilitate customer retention and cross sell activities.

  Our Market
 
 We currently operate in the powersports and recreational vehicle market with significant scale and breadth of products. The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates that in 2014, 9.2 million people owned 10.1 million motorcycles in the United States. 87% of these were on-highway models, our initial targeted segment. According to the Powersports Business 2016 Market Data Book, or the 2016 Market Data book, pre-owned motorcycle registrations were 1.1 million units in 2015 with new unit sales of approximately 573,000 or approximately $7 billion in new vehicle sales. The owner demographic is favorable to the market outlook as millennials and baby boomers are maturing into the median ranges. The owner group is characterized by brand loyal riding enthusiasts. According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, in 2014 the median owner age was 47 years with a median income of $62,200 which is approximately 10% above the United States’ average. The dealer market is fragmented with an estimated 10,000 outlets authorized to sell powersports and recreation vehicles that include new and pre-owned motorcycles, scooter, and all-terrain vehicles.
 
 The ATV, UTV/side-by-side, snowmobile and personal watercraft vehicle, or PWC, markets, are a logical next extension for our platform, as there is significant overlap in the motorcycle dealer base with dealers of these products. According to data from Power Product Marketing and the 2016 Market Data Book, there were approximately 630,000 sales of ATV/UTV/Side-by-sides in 2015. There are approximately 1.2 million snowmobiles registered in the United States (another 600,000 in Canada) and in 2016, approximately 95,000 snowmobiles were sold in the United States and Canada. Lastly, according the National Marine Manufacturers Association and the Personal Watercraft Industry Association, in 2015 there were more than 54,000 new PWCs sold in the United States and there are currently approximately 1.2 million PWCs registered in the United States.
 
 As we look to further extend the platform, the two largest adjacent segments are represented by the recreational boating and recreational vehicle (motor vehicle or trailer equipped with living space and amenities found in a home) industries. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, there were approximately 15.7 million recreational boats in the United States in 2014, and there were approximately 940,000 sales of pre-owned boats in 2014. Correspondingly, the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association estimates that currently more than 8.9 million households own an RV and in 2017 there will be over 470,000 shipments of RVs from manufacturers to dealers.
 
  Competition
 
 The United States pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicle marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and pre-owned vehicles; independent dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an outstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of vehicles, breadth and depth of product selection, and value pricing. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in pre-owned vehicle retailing includes our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying experience by virtue of our low, no-haggle prices and our 100% online marketplace platform including our website and mobile application and our ability to make a cash offer to purchase a vehicle with our customer-friendly sales process and our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on our website. In addition, we believe our willingness to make a cash offer to purchase a customer’s vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a vehicle from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles allowing us to offer value-oriented pricing. We believe the principal competitive factors for our ancillary products and services include an ability to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices delivered in an efficient manner to the customer. We will compete with a variety of entities in offering these products including banks, finance companies, insurance and warranty providers and extended vehicle service contract providers. We believe our competitive strengths in this category will include our ability to deliver products in an efficient manner to customers utilizing our technology and our ability to partner with key participants in each category to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices. Lastly, additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we will operate.
 Seasonality
 
 Historically, the industry has been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the fall quarter but increase in February and March, coinciding with tax refund season.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
 Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy.  As of December 31, 2017, we have a trademark registration for “RumbleOn” and various applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 Government Regulation
 
 Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.

  State Motor Vehicle Sales, Advertising and Brokering Laws
 
 The advertising and sale of new or pre-owned motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states in which we do business. Although we do not anticipate selling new vehicles, state regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which powersports and recreational vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. If our products and services are determined to not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states. In addition, even absent such a determination, to the extent dealers are uncertain about the applicability of such laws and regulations to our business, we may lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of dealers in our network, which would affect our future growth.
 
 Several states have laws and regulations that strictly regulate or prohibit the brokering of motor recreational vehicles or the making of so-called “bird-dog” payments by dealers to third parties in connection with the sale of motor vehicles through persons other than licensed salespersons. If our products or services are determined to fall within the scope of such laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures, which could be costly, to reduce our exposure to those obligations, including the discontinuation of certain products or services in affected jurisdictions. Additionally, such a determination could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation.
 
 In addition to generally applicable consumer protection laws, many states in which we may do business either have or may implement laws and regulations that specifically regulate the advertising for sale of new or pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles. These state advertising laws and regulations may not be uniform from state to state, sometimes imposing inconsistent requirements on the advertiser of a new or pre-owned recreational vehicle. If the content displayed on the websites we operate is determined or alleged to be inaccurate or misleading, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation. Moreover, such allegations, even if unfounded or decided in our favor, could be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant sums in settlements, and could interfere with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states.
 
  Federal Advertising Regulations
 
 The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.
 Federal Antitrust Laws
 
 The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be pre-owned by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our dealer network.
 
 In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.
 
 The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability.
