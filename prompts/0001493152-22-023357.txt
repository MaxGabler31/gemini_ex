STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN AND 2021 PROGRESSION
 
When we began executing on our current strategy of restructuring and recapitalization, the Company had approximately $16.2 million in assets and only a handful of struggling or undercapitalized businesses. In just over two years, we divested underperforming assets, added eight distinct business lines, and grew assets to more than $285 million, which includes a significant amount of cash to leverage our ongoing business plan. We believe 2022 will be a breakout year for DSS. The tireless work of our dedicated team since embarking on our strategy to transform the Company in late 2019 has led to significant value creation and placed us on a solid trajectory for accelerated growth.
 
We continue to revitalize the company by focusing on strengthening the organization by (i) exiting unprofitable business lines, (ii) investing in and reviving the Company’s core businesses, (iii) improving top line revenues and net margins, (iv) controlling costs and (v) creating new long-term scalable, recurring revenue streams. 
 
In 2020, we made the decision to divest the DSS Plastics Group and sold the primary assets of DSS Plastics Group to a subsidiary of Bristol Graphics for $683,000 at closing, and a contingency payment (earnout) of $517,000 that may be earned over the following 12-month period, $390,000 of which was recognized in 2020. The remaining asset and liability of this division is its lease space located in Brisbane, California. In April 2021, the Company terminated this lease with the landlord effective March 31, 2021. Early in 2021, the company was formally dissolved.


In May 2021, DSS, Inc. and Proof Authentication Corporation (“Proof”) signed a purchase agreement pursuant to which Proof acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of DSS Digital, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS and the Company’s anti-counterfeit, authentication, and brand protection technology. DSS retained certain key customers through a non-exclusive licensing agreement while continuing to use the innovative anti-counterfeiting technology on consumer packaging for authentication and consumer engagement purposes under the Company’s Premier Packaging Corp. division. 
 
REVIVING ONE OF OUR CORE BUSINESSES
 
In 2020, management made substantial adjustments to revive and improve the productivity and operating revenue of our Premier Packaging Corporation, Inc. (Premier) subsidiary. We have invested in operations, state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment, people, and processes to increase its capacity, improve quality and delivery, and to ensure it has the resources to support its growing customer base and their evolving supply chain demands. We have completed its facility expansion with operations beginning at the new 105,000 sq. ft. facility in early March 2022, where DSS, Inc.’s Headquarters will also be located.
 
We will continue to add capabilities in key areas that increase operational efficiencies to strengthen our foundation and offerings to our customers, while continuing to provide world-class customer service to the customers we serve.
 
IMPLEMENTING BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION INITIATIVES
 
One of the most important objectives of our strategic business plan is the commitment to diversify the Company’s operating revenue. Management believes it imperative to transition the Company’s revenue into new business lines which generate scalable and reoccurring revenue, preferably in contemporary and emerging growth business opportunities. To achieve this goal, we continue to acquire, invest in, or start-up new business lines that meet this criterion. Adding additional products and assets to existing business lines is essential so that current operations can continue on their growth trajectory and further transition toward scalable, recurring revenue streams.


Within the past year, we have had three successful public offerings and have put this capital to work in several ways. Our diverse book of clients and investments has given us strong competitive advantages globally in many industries; we intend to aggressively capitalize on these advantages moving forward.


In 2021, the Company made substantial investments in the following new and existing business lines:
 
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) - A portion of this capital has been deployed into American Medical REIT (AMRE), a subsidiary of DSS Securities, Inc., which acquired its first four medical facilities in 2021, totaling approximately 360,000 sq. ft. of quality healthcare assets across the US and more than $74 million in assets. This division is now generating average yields of approximately eight percent, and we have a massive pipeline of opportunities to further grow AMRE in the quarters ahead – including an LOI for a property that could more than double its total assets.
 
While other areas within commercial real estate have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic, medical real estate has demonstrated considerable resiliency and demand. With a now formidable foundation in place, we are in a great position to further pursue opportunities to expand AMRE as we continue to execute on our strategic growth plans. Ultimately, this is a business we intend to spinoff in an IPO at an optimal time, enabling us to further share our success with our shareholders.

COMMERCIAL LENDING - The expansion of our medical real estate holdings is in part supported by our lending and financing business line, primarily through our majority-owned American Pacific Bancorp, Inc. (APB) subsidiary. APB issued nearly $20 million in new loans since September 2021 and has assembled a diversified portfolio of strong credit quality. In addition to commercially licensed medical real estate financing, APB’s portfolio includes governmental bond anticipation note financing, C&I inventory and equipment financing, and land development loans.
 
Our $40 million 2021 third quarter investment in APB has been extremely successful, driving the expansion of our reoccurring scalable business income model in multiple ways. We now have nearly half of the fresh funds we injected generating interest and fee income, and we expect to have another $15 million loaned out in the near-term as we build our portfolio of high-quality commercial loans.
 
DSS BIOHEALTH SECURITY, INC. -
 
Impact BioMedical progressed on multiple fronts in 2021, including key patent awards, the advancement of key programs, the release of positive study results, and furthering of global manufacturing and pharmaceutical licensing discussions. We anticipate announcing our first licensing deal in the near future.


In July 2021, Impact BioMedical entered a collaboration to research its plant-based preservation booster, Procombin. Personal care as well as household and institutional cleaning formulators are dealing with a dwindling set of options for safe and effective preservatives and preservation boosters. Procombin was developed to address this challenge by using plant-based solutions to increase the effectiveness of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents. Major contract negotiations are underway for the potential use of Procombin in a wide range of consumer products, ranging from household cleaning products to shampoos and conditioners.
 
During the past year, Impact BioMedical has laid the groundwork for a future that is focused on scientifically tested, high-impact solutions to global problems that humans are facing from food preservation to antibiotics to creating new ways to develop medicines.


In addition to Impact BioMedical, we expanded our BioHealth business in 2021 through investments in Vivacitas Oncology, Inc. (Vivacitas) and Puradigm, LLC. (Puradigm). These investments give us positions in both the oncology space as well as the air purification and pathogen prevention market. 
 
Our March 2021 investment in Vivacitas, a clinical-stage company focused on difficult-to-treat cancers, further demonstrated our commitment to addressing unmet needs in healthcare. With a rich pipeline of promising assets, Vivacitas provides significant upside potential.
 
In May 2021, we launched DSS PureAir, Inc. concurrently with our investment in Puradigm, the developer of innovative proactive air and surface purifications solutions. Even before COVID-19, the market for air purifiers was strong, and now growth is accelerating even more. Our partnership with Puradigm enables us to rapidly enter this growing global market with best-in-class products and distribution rights in North America, as well as exclusive distribution rights in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, and other Asian markets.


DECENTRALIZED SHARING SYSTEMS - The Direct Marketing / Online Sales industry is a market that will help us diversify and meet our scalable reoccurring revenue target in an exponential growth industry with high profit margins. The direct marketing, network marketing, or online sales is designed to sell products or services directly to the public through independent distributors, rather than selling through the traditional retail market. We believed that with the transition of a significant sector of retail sales now converting to the now popular “gig economy”, an investment in this business model would meet our strategic business plan objective and vision.
 
On March 1, 2021, Decentralized Sharing Systems, Inc. (“Decentralized”) announced that it increased its investment in Sharing Services Global Corporation (“Sharing Services” or “SHRG”), a publicly traded company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition and development of innovative companies, products, and technologies in the direct selling industry, through a $30 million convertible promissory note dated April 5, 2021. Through this investment in Sharing Services Global, we gained controlling interest with nearly 60 percent ownership. The SHRG platform leverages the capabilities and expertise of various companies that market and sell products direct to the consumer and generated nearly $28 million in revenue in the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
 
With SHRG now officially part of the DSS family, we believe we are in a great position to accelerate its customer acquisition, new product development, and portfolio of offerings as we capitalize on a wealth of growth opportunities and potential synergies in this exciting, multi-billion-dollar industry. Building upon the success already achieved by the SHRG team, we plan to explore opportunities to enter new markets while continuing to expand SHRG’s independent representative network, both domestically and globally, which currently stands at more than 14,000 active distributors. In addition to capitalizing on organic growth opportunities, we are actively exploring some very exciting potential acquisitions to further accelerate our growth in this attractive and sizeable global market.

With our increased position and majority ownership of SHRG, its financials will be consolidated moving forward. Based on historical performance, this alone places DSS on a solid trajectory to generate potential revenue in excess of $50 million in 2022, representing potentially more than a 150 percent increase in revenue growth year-over-year.
 
SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GROUP - The Securities business line was organized in 2019 as part of the strategic business plan to establish or acquire assets positioned for long-term and scalable, recurring fee income. These targeted investments include REITs, broker/dealers, mutual funds management, ETFs, and other fund management platforms.


Our rapidly growing securities business line achieved strong footholds achieved in 2021 – including strategic investments in broker dealers WestPark Capital and Sentinel Brokers; the formation of Liquid Value Asset Management Limited (LVAM), and the launch of our DSS AmericaFirst Quantitative Funds (DSS AmericaFirst) family.


LVAM is a proprietary algorithmic trading firm majority owned by our wholly owned subsidiary, DSS Financial Management, Inc. Led by Wilson Lee, former co-head of Societe Generale’s equity derivatives in Asia, and Jackson Kwan, a former portfolio manager at Citadel in Chicago, LVAM aims to include short- and long-term trades while offering the unique attribute of being able to liquidate the portfolio into cash within five to ten minutes under normal market conditions. Together with the strong performance track record of the team, these attributes position LVAM as a prime vehicle for private and institutional investors seeking a highly liquid investment fund with extremely attractive risk adjusted returns relative to the volatility and unpredictability of the markets.
 
DSS AmericaFirst, launched in the fourth quarter of 2021, is a suite of mutual funds managed by DSS Wealth Management, Inc. DSS AmericaFirst currently consists of four mutual funds and expects to expand into numerous investment platforms including additional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, unit investment trusts, and closed-end funds.
 
Reporting Operating Segments:
 
As we have reported above, we financially report business operating results on only five operating segments, which we believe will certainly increase and transition as the newer lines of business develop and mature. However, the five business segments that we are reporting on in 2021 are as follows:

The division also provides resources and production equipment for our ongoing research and development of security printing, brand protection, consumer engagement and related technologies. Premier is nearing completion of its facility expansion with operations expected to begin at the new 105,000 sq. ft. facility in early March 2022.

Traditional RIA’s, Brokers Dealers, REIT’s and other personal investment companies would also be considered competition.
 
Customers
 
Product Packaging: During 2021, two customers accounted for approximately 41% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2021, these two customers accounted for approximately 48% of our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2020, these two customers accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenue and 60% of the Company’s consolidated trade accounts receivable balance. This customer diversification improvement was driven by addition of several new customers to our overall customer base.

Securities and Investment Management: Since October of 2021, our Securities and Investment Management division has a mixture of retail and institutional investors.
 
Raw Materials
 
Product Packaging: The primary raw materials the Company uses in its businesses are paper, paperboard, corrugated board and ink. The Company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies and uses a wide variety of paper grades, formats, ink formulations and colors. Paper and paperboard prices continued to increase in 2022, and we believe increases in future years are expected. Except for certain packaging customers where the Company enters into annual contracts, for which changes in paperboard pricing is absorbed by the Company, the Company has historically passed substantially all increases and decreases to its customers, although there can be no assurances that the Company will continue to do so in the future.


Direct Marketing: Sources its products from 3rd party suppliers for nutritional, performance, and health and beauty product ingredients. We rely on our extensive supplier network for availability of an extensive range of vitamins, minerals, botanicals, plant and herb extracts, as well as nutritional supplements. We are expecting continue price pressure and supply chain issues into 2022 and have put significant risk mitigation strategies in place to avoid dramatic P&L effects based on this anticipated and continued volatility. The company passes any substantial increase of its raw materials or finished goods on to its customers to limit any significant margin impact.


Environmental Compliance
 
It is the Company’s policy to conduct its operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other requirements. While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Government Regulation
 
Our biotechnology business is faced with potential government regulations. If new legislation, regulations, or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our patent monetization efforts and, in turn, our assets, expenses and revenue. United States patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The America Invents Act includes several significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities, such as our Company, on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could adversely impact our ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.
 
Moreover, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.

LOOKING AHEAD IN 2022
 
We believe 2022 will be a breakout year for DSS. Spurred by innovation, industry needs, and timely acquisitions, in 2022 we will focus on improving top line revenue and top line revenue diversification and profitability. Through our expertly cultivated processes and industry research, we can ensure the success of our projects across diverse sectors and business environments. The opportunities within our business lines and high-growth markets have unlimited potential, and our entities within these sectors are contemporary, scalable, and offer recurring revenue opportunities.
 
When we began executing on our current strategy of restructuring and recapitalization, the Company had approximately $16.2 million in assets and only a handful of struggling or undercapitalized businesses. In just two years, we divested underperforming assets, added eight distinct business lines, and grew assets to more than $285 million, which includes $57 million in cash as of our December 31, 2021 filing with the SEC. Today, we have approximately 40 subsidiaries operating across nine attractive market business lines, with five of those business lines now with significant operations and generating revenue. 
 
We have been fortunate to have attracted tremendous talent to lead each of our business units. When building out our businesses, we look for established, industry leaders with long track records and the expertise to add meaningful value to our DSS ecosystem and create a foundation for success.
 
Our diverse book of clients and investments has given us strong competitive advantages globally in many industries; we intend to aggressively capitalize on these advantages moving forward. We believe the momentum of our success and ongoing evolution will continue to be unabated in 2022 based on the multitude of major successes in 2021 that are key drivers and the catalyst of new value creation in the coming year and beyond.
