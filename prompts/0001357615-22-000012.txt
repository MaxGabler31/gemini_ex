Additional information relating to the Frazer-Nash acquisition is described in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
HomeSafe Alliance LLC Contract Award
In November 2021, we announced that HomeSafe Alliance LLC (“HomeSafe”), a KBR led joint venture, was awarded the global household goods contract by U.S. Transportation Command. The contract ceiling value is $20 billion with a potential 9-year term, inclusive of all options periods. HomeSafe is expected to be the exclusive household goods move management service provider for the U.S. Armed Forces, Department of Defense civilians and their families. Under this contract, HomeSafe plans to modernize and infuse technology to improve the domestic and international relocation experience for all military personnel and their families. The contract award is currently under protest.
Significant Joint Ventures and Alliances
We enter into joint ventures and alliances with other reputable industry participants to capitalize on the strengths of each party and provide greater flexibility in delivering our services based on expertise, cost and geographical efficiency, increase the number of opportunities that can be pursued and reduce exposure and diversify risk. Our significant joint ventures and alliances are described below. All joint venture ownership percentages presented are stated as of December 31, 2021.
Aspire Defence Limited, a joint venture owned by KBR and two financial investors, provides a range of facilities life cycle management services at the British Army’s garrisons at Aldershot and across the Salisbury Plain in the U.K. KBR owns 45% of Aspire Defence Limited that is reported within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting.
In 2016, we established the Affinity joint venture with Elbit Systems Ltd. to procure, operate and maintain aircraft and aircraft-related assets over an 18-year contract period, in support of the UKMFTS project. KBR owns a 50% interest in Affinity. In addition, KBR owns a 50% interest in the two joint ventures, Affinity Capital Works and Affinity Flying Services, which provide procurement, operations and management support services under subcontracts with Affinity. The investments are accounted for within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting. 
Brown & Root Industrial Services is a joint venture with Bernhard Capital Partners and offers maintenance services, turnarounds and small capital projects, primarily in North America, in which we own 50% equity interest. The investment is accounted for within our STS business segment using the equity method of accounting.
JKC Australia LNG is a joint venture contracted to perform the engineering, procurement, supply, construction and commissioning of onshore LNG facilities for a client in Darwin, Australia. The project is being executed through two entities (collectively, "JKC"), which are VIEs, in which we own a 30% equity interest. The investment is accounted for within our STS business segment using the equity method of accounting. 
Backlog of Unfulfilled Orders
Backlog is our estimate of the U.S. dollar amount of future revenues we expect to realize as a result of performing work on awarded contracts. For projects within our unconsolidated joint ventures, we have included our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s estimated revenues in backlog to provide an indication of future work to be performed. The future revenues we expect to realize as a result of backlog was $15.0 billion and $15.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with approximately 17% and 16%, respectively, related to work being executed by joint ventures accounted for using the equity method of accounting. We estimate as of December 31, 2021, 30% of our backlog will be recognized as revenues or equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates within fiscal year 2022. For additional information regarding backlog, see our discussion within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Contracts and Regulations
Our business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, principally the U.S. DoD and NASA. When working with these and other U.S. government agencies and entities, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. U.S. government contracts are generally subject to the FAR, which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, other agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD FAR Supplement ("DFARS"), and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements. Among other things, these laws and regulations:
•require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;
•define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-type U.S. government contracts;
•require compliance with CAS;
•require reviews by the DCAA, DCMA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with a contractor’s business systems; 
•restrict the use and dissemination of and require the protection of unclassified contract-related information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data; and
•prohibit competing for work if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, as defined by these laws and regulations, related to such work exists and/or cannot be appropriately mitigated, neutralized or avoided.
Our GS business segment primarily performs work under cost-reimbursable contracts in the U.S. with the DoD and other U.S. governmental agencies. If the U.S. government concludes costs charged to a contract are not reimbursable under the terms of the contract or applicable procurement regulations, these costs are disallowed or, if already reimbursed, we may be required to refund the reimbursed amounts to the customer. Such conditions may also include interest and other financial penalties. If performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the customer retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. Generally, our customers have the contractual right to terminate or reduce the amount of work under our contracts at any time. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our GS business segment also participates in PFI contracts, such as the Aspire Defence and UKMFTS projects. PFIs are long-term contracts that outsource the responsibility for the construction, procurement, financing, operation and maintenance of government-owned assets to the private sector. These contracts may contain both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable elements. The PFI projects in which KBR participates are all located in the U.K. with contractual terms ranging from 15 to 35 years, and involve the provision of services to various types of assets ranging from acquisition and maintenance of major military equipment and housing to transportation infrastructure. Under most of these PFI contracts, the primary deliverables of the contracting entity are the initial construction or procurement of assets for the customer and the subsequent provision of lifecycle management services for the life of such assets. The amount of renumeration from the customer to the contracting entity is negotiated on each contract and varies depending on the specific terms for each PFI. 
Contract Types
The Company performs work under contracts that broadly consist of fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials or a combination of the three. 
Fixed-price contracts include both lump-sum and unit-rate contracts. Under lump-sum contracts, we perform a defined scope of work for a specified fee to cover all costs and any profit element. Lump-sum contracts entail significant risk to us because they require us to predetermine the work to be performed, the project execution schedule and all the costs associated with the scope of work. Unit-rate contracts are essentially fixed-price contracts with the only variable being units of work to be performed. Further, our fixed-price contracts may include cost escalation and other features that allow for increases in price should certain events occur or conditions change. Fixed-price contracts are typically subject to change orders if the scope of work changes or unforeseen conditions arise resulting in adjustments to the fixed price. Although fixed-price contracts involve greater risk than cost-reimbursable contracts, they also are potentially more profitable because the owner/customer pays a premium to transfer project risks to us.
Time-and-materials contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor. The rates cover the cost of direct labor, indirect expense and fee. These contracts can also allow for reimbursement of cost of 
material plus a fee, if applicable. In U.S. government contracting, this type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty of the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. With respect to time-and-materials contracts, we assume the price risk because our costs of performance may exceed negotiated hourly rates. In commercial and non-U.S. government contracting, this contract is generally used for defined and non-defined scope contracts where there is a higher degree of uncertainty and risks as to the scope of work. These types of contracts may also provide for a guaranteed maximum price where the total cost plus the fee cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price or not-to-exceed provisions.
Under cost-reimbursable contracts, the price is generally variable based upon our actual allowable costs incurred for materials, equipment, reimbursable labor hours, overhead and G&A expenses. Profit on cost-reimbursable contracts may be in the form of a fixed fee or a mark-up applied to costs incurred, or a combination of the two. The fee may also be an incentive fee based on performance indicators, milestones or targets and can be based on customer discretion or in the form of an award fee determined based on customer evaluation of the Company's performance against contractual criteria. Cost-reimbursable contracts may also provide for a guaranteed maximum price where the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. Cost-reimbursable contracts are generally less risky because the owner/customer retains many of the project risks, however it generally requires us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and budget. Cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S. government are generally subject to the FAR and are competitively priced based on estimated or actual costs of providing the contractual goods or services. The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies. Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Equipment and materials essential to our business are obtained from a variety of global sources. The principal equipment and materials we use in our business are subject to availability and price fluctuations due to customer demand, producer capacity and market conditions. We monitor the availability and price of equipment and materials on a regular basis. Our procurement function seeks to leverage our size and buying power to ensure that we have access to key equipment and materials at low prices and ideal delivery schedules. While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant supply chain disruptions globally and within the United States, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate experiencing, any significant procurement difficulties, as we purchase our required materials and equipment from a variety of sources. However, a number of factors that we may not be able to predict or control could result in increased costs for these materials, including the continued impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as global trade relationships and other general market and political conditions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Intellectual Property
The use of intellectual property generally benefits our STS business segment. We have developed, acquired or otherwise have the right to license leading technologies, including technologies held under license from third parties, used for the production of a variety of petrochemicals and chemicals and in the areas of olefins, refining, fertilizers, coal gasification, semi-submersibles and specialty chemicals. We also license a variety of technologies for the transformation of raw materials into commodity chemicals such as phenol which is used in the production of consumer end products. In addition, we are a licensor of ammonia process technologies used in the conversion of natural gas to ammonia with a fully developed, proprietary, end-to-end green ammonia solution K-GreeNTM. We are the exclusive licensor of Hydro-PRTTM, a cutting-edge, scalable technology that utilizes supercritical steam to convert a wide range of single-use and other plastics into commercial raw materials used to produce new plastics. We also offer technologies for crystallization and evaporation, concentration and purification of strong inorganic acids. We believe our technology portfolio and experience in the commercial application of these technologies and our related know-how differentiates us, enables our sustainability strategy and enhances our margins.
Our rights to make use of technologies licensed to us are governed by written agreements of varying durations, including some with fixed terms that are subject to renewal based on mutual agreement. Generally, each agreement may be further extended and we have historically been able to renew existing agreements before they expire. We expect these and other similar agreements to be extended so long as it is mutually advantageous to both parties at the time of renewal. For technologies we own, we protect our rights, know-how and trade secrets through patents and confidentiality agreements.
Seasonality
Our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. However, various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods, including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance. Additionally, weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services. 
Environmental Regulation
Our business involves planning, design, program management, construction and construction management and operations and maintenance at various project sites throughout the world, including oil field and related energy infrastructure construction services, in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Our operations may require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic or hazardous substances, which are subject to stringent and complex laws relating to the protection of the environment and prevention of pollution.
Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, and some laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed. For example, there are a number of governmental laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and comparable national and state laws that impose strict, joint and several liabilities for the entire cost of cleanup, without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. In addition, some environmental regulations can impose liability for the entire clean-up on owners, operators, transporters and other persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such hazardous substances costs related to contaminated facilities or project sites. Other environmental laws applicable to our and customers' operations affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act as well as other comparable foreign and state laws. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances or a failure to comply with any applicable environmental and worker health and safety laws regulations could result in substantial costs to us, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage, personal injury or cessation of remediation activities.
Additional information relating to environmental regulations is described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
Human Capital Management
Across KBR, 2021 has been known as ‘the year of our people’. We entered the year with ambitious plans to build on our empowering culture, enhance our employee experience and ensure that we deserve our reputation as an employer of choice. Through the combined efforts of our employees and leadership team, this bold initiative has already resulted in tangible benefits for our people and the business, helping us realize our vision to bring together the best and brightest to deliver technology and solutions that help our customers accomplish their most critical missions and objectives.
Culture and Values
We refreshed our One KBR Values in late 2020, as follows:
•We Value Our People
•We Deliver
•We Are People of Integrity
•We Empower
•We Are a Team of Teams
We brought these to life early in 2021 by a cascade of conversations between managers and their teams in every business and market. Our aim was to lift our values off the page and into our employees’ local experience, identifying any areas for improvement and building on our existing strengths. This concerted effort was underpinned by a review of our people processes to ensure these reflect our culture and values, resulting in updates to selection and exit interviews, job descriptions and training collateral. We then tested how embedded the values are through our global ‘People Perspectives’ employee survey, achieving high scores in each value area. This positive feedback about our organizational culture is particularly encouraging as many employees continued to work remotely through the pandemic. However, we are not complacent. Leaders across KBR continue to consciously reinforce our values through their everyday behavior and to proactively engage and communicate with their teams as hybrid working arrangements become the new normal. 
Employee Health & Safety
We are subject to numerous worker health and safety laws and regulations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation, the Mine Safety and Health Administration laws and safety requirements of the Departments of State, Defense, Energy and Transportation of the U.S. government. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including the U.K. where we are subject to the various regulations enacted by the Health and Safety Act of 1974. These laws and regulations are frequently changing, and it is impossible to predict with certainty the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future.
Our global Zero Harm culture encompasses ten sustainability pillars. The central pillar is Health Safety & Security and is supported by the key Zero Harm principle of “Courage to Care,” which we define as the willingness to intervene when one observes something that does not meet acceptable standards. We believe our Zero Harm culture has resulted in a work environment that promotes employee engagement and ownership. Although we have experienced significant improvement in our safety performance indicators, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful and from time to time we may experience incidents or unsafe work conditions or practices may arise. Our project sites often put our employees and others in proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials. Additionally, our employees and others at certain project sites may be exposed to severe weather events or high security risks. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally sound workplace for all of our employees and those who work with us. Consequently, we may incur substantial costs to maintain the safety and security of our personnel in these locations.
COVID-19
As the dynamic impacts of the pandemic continued to affect all businesses and markets throughout 2021, the employees of KBR have been reassured by our robust safety protocols, which are founded on our Zero Harm culture. Our people are resilient, and while personal and operational challenges have persisted, they continued to provide excellent service to our customers. 
During 2021, we introduced a requirement for all people attending KBR sites to be fully vaccinated, or by exception to undertake daily testing, to safeguard the health of visitors and colleagues. Safety protocols remained in place, such as social 
distancing and wearing masks, and this safe environment has enabled large numbers of employees previously working from home to return to the workplace in accordance with local pandemic guidance. In the US, we prepared early for the Executive Order for Federal Contractors, and by the end of 2021, 95% of affected employees were either vaccinated or had approved accommodations in place and underway. 
Mental Health & Fitness
During 2021, our focus on employee wellbeing to enable peak performance continued, and our Mental Health & Wellbeing Committee and Employee Resource Group ("ERG"), OK NoW ("Network of Well-Being"), took significant strides implementing our wellbeing strategy. A structured communication program, global roll-out of training to over 700 managers and expansion of our Wellbeing Ambassadors program to over 9,000 employees have helped create an environment where employees can thrive and perform at their best. We also provide all employees and their families with free 24/7 access to a first-rate employee support program and a mental fitness app to help track and support their mental health and resilience. These efforts have resulted in a supportive environment as evidenced in our global survey results, where we achieved a high Wellbeing Index score.
Organization Agility 
KBR continues to grow organically and through acquisition, while remaining agile and restructuring where required to support our long-term strategy. At the end of 2021, we employed approximately 28,000 people performing diverse, complex and mission critical roles in 34 countries. In addition, our unconsolidated joint ventures employ approximately 10,000 employees. 
With a fundamental focus on our customers, our working practices adapt to their projects and priorities while empowering our employees to balance personal and work commitments through increasing adoption of flexible working practices. This agile working approach has also supported our Inclusion & Diversity journey, allowing us to recruit from global and diverse talent pools. Responses to our global survey demonstrated that this modern approach resonates with our employees, with a majority saying they are able to balance their work and personal lives and have the flexibility to take time off while still meeting the needs of our fast-paced, customer-focused organization. 
Talent Acquisition
In 2021, we hired almost 6,000 employees, and while some markets found candidates in shorter supply, we maintained a strong applicant flow by clearly articulating our EVP, running social media campaigns highlighting KBR’s unique culture and values and showcasing the important work our employees perform across the world. 
Teams of experts from across KBR reviewed our onboarding and hiring processes to ensure best practices are adopted in all business areas and we expanded our use of digital talent platforms to monitor candidate supply and demand in real time. During the year, we instituted unconscious bias training for all new recruiters and managers and undertook a concerted effort of outreach to diverse candidates, including recruitment at historically black colleges and universities and veteran hiring events. We have also begun to track the progress of diverse candidates through our HR information systems, which showed that 30% of our new hires were women and 49% were Black, Indigenous or people of color.
Inclusion & Diversity
The leadership team at KBR fundamentally believes that Inclusion & Diversity ("I&D") is good for business. It helps us innovate, helps our teams perform and creates an environment where everyone can belong. Diversity is embedded in KBR, with employees from over 120 countries. In 2021, we increased our data capture to encompass race/ethnicity in all markets, with 94% of all employee records now updated. As of December 31, 2021, our employees had the following gender and race/ethnicity demographics:

Additionally, our Board of Directors is 30% women and 30% Black, Indigenous or people of color. Our particular attention on gender increasingly shows in our demographics with the percentage of women in KBR increasing from 23.4% to 24.8% in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Our I&D Council helps shape our strategic priorities. In 2021, it provided recommendations related to working practices, target setting, supporting racial and ethnic diversity and sustainability in the supply chain. Furthermore, it has committed to identifying best practices to create an inclusive organization for employees with disabilities, increase the number of women in operational and business leadership roles and improve retention of diverse talent.
In 2021, we required each area of the business to develop and implement a tailored I&D action plan, which was directly linked to payout under our short-term incentive program. Our 2022 plans will build on this baseline while incorporating the 2021 recommendations from the I&D Council as appropriate. 
We continue to strive for increased visibility of I&D data, enabling us to better analyze our performance across all people processes, from the candidate pipeline to pay equity, and in 2022 we are extending our data capture of veteran status and sexual orientation. With enhancements to our benefits, such as the introduction of supplementary childcare/elder-care benefits and expansion of floating holidays, and persistent focus on I&D among our Team of Teams, we are confident that KBR will continue to see improvements within our gender and race/ethnicity demographics. In 2021, KBR's President and Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action Pledge, making a public commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, and KBR has been recognized externally for our progress to date with our ranking in the top 100 of Forbes’ list of The World’s Top Female-Friendly Companies. 
Employee Resource Groups
For many years, KBR has encouraged employees to participate in employee-led Employee Resource Groups, where networking, advocacy and education help instill an environment where everyone can contribute. In addition to OK NoW, our ERG focused on mental health and wellbeing, we have expanded our ERGs in the I&D arena with the addition of the Armed Forces Community, the globalization of our Pride & Allies ERG and plans to launch MERGE, an ERG focused on minority groups. Together with ASPIRE, our ERG focused on the promotion of gender diversity, these other I&D focused ERGs came together in the ‘All In’ community, which was launched in 2021, and held a series of high-impact events on topics ranging from neurodiversity to understanding disabilities in the workplace. Our ERGs are rounded out with IMPACT, the community for early career professionals, which also expanded globally in 2021 to host a series of fireside chats with the CEO and virtual networking events to connect colleagues across KBR. Our Team of Teams value is embedded in these ERGs, giving employees a strong voice across KBR, and providing inspiring insight for leaders and colleagues across the globe.
Talent Development & Succession
In addition to our focus on developing early career professionals, which includes established intern and graduate programs, KBR offers a suite of world-class courses for employees in management and leadership roles. Together with the extension of our formal talent review processes in 2021, they help strengthen succession planning at all levels, supplementing the Board’s continued oversight of our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Leadership Team succession planning. During the year, we also introduced a formal Front Line Leaders program, designed to support employees newly transitioning into these critical roles, and began implementing a new approach to performance management, with frequent, real-time feedback conversations replacing traditional performance reviews. 
Our other area of focus was on technical talent. In 2021, we welcomed 12 distinguished technical leaders to the inaugural One KBR Technical Fellows program. This important program fosters our culture of innovation, fuels collaboration across diverse disciplines and helps us attract, mentor and inspire the next generation of talent.
Employee Engagement
In line with the labor market tightening across the globe, we saw an increase in voluntary turnover in 2021 in some countries when pent up demand from early in the pandemic was released as economies rebounded. Our agile hiring practices allowed us to keep pace with demand for talent, with applicant flow and staffing levels remaining at previous strong levels. This resilience was helped by our continued focus on our employees evidenced by the results of our People Perspectives Survey in which a majority of our employees said KBR is a great place to work. As well as many strengths, employee feedback from the survey identified opportunities to improve and we are developing plans to increase employees' engagement across KBR. 
With remote working commonplace, our communications programs continued to modernize with the introduction of the KBR podcast ‘In Orbit’, the continued development of our Communities of Interest and our ‘People First’ video series in which leaders discussed how our people strategy is supporting KBR employees across the world. Our employees’ high level of engagement is deep-rooted with a majority of respondents feeling proud of what they accomplish and is a credit to their managers who scored highly in the survey’s Manager Effectiveness Index. Each business area has developed a plan to build on this positive response and address any local areas of concern as we continue to put our people at the heart of KBR. 
Ethics and Compliance
We prioritize conducting our business with ethics and integrity. We are subject to numerous compliance-related laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, other applicable anti-bribery legislation and laws and regulations regarding trade and exports. The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to the FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, CAS, the Services Contract Act, DoD security regulations and many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. We are also governed by our own Code of Business Conduct (our "Code") and other compliance-related corporate policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws. Our Code is a guide for every employee in applying legal and ethical practices to our everyday work. In particular, our Code describes our standards of integrity and relevant principles and areas of law most likely to affect our business. We regularly train our employees regarding our Code and other specific areas including anti-bribery compliance and international trade compliance.
