Raw Materials
The Company uses a wide variety of raw materials which are generally purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has an adequate supply of raw materials necessary to meet demand and continues to actively manage recent supply chain constraints. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity pricing and inflation and attempts to control these impacts through increased prices to customers and various other programs with its suppliers. 
Suppliers
The Company manufactures many of the parts and components used in its products. Substantially all materials, parts and components purchased by the Company are available from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has a sufficient number of suppliers necessary to meet demand and continues to actively manage recent supply chain constraints. 
Inventory and Backlog
The Company regularly and systematically adjusts production schedules and quantities based on the flow of incoming orders. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, backlog generally was not considered a significant factor in the Company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of the Company’s products. During 2021, backlog significantly increased due to supply chain constraints and inventory increased to support production. The Company remains focused on delivering products and services to customers against an elevated backlog and continues to actively manage inventory levels.
Shared Services
The Company has production facilities in Suzhou, China and Vadodara, India that support multiple business units. During 2021, the Company embarked on projects to expand both the China and India facilities in an effort to increase its footprint in these emerging markets as the Company believes there is tremendous potential for growth across all segments. The projects are expected to be completed in 2022. In addition, IDEX has personnel in China, India, Dubai, Mexico, Latin America and Singapore that provide sales, marketing, product design, engineering and sourcing support to its business units in those regions 
as well as personnel in various locations in South America, the Middle East, Korea and Japan to support sales and marketing efforts in those regions.
Employees
At December 31, 2021, the Company had 7,536 employees. Approximately 5% of its employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions, with various contracts expiring through November 2023. Management believes that the Company has a positive relationship with its employees. The Company historically has been able to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements satisfactorily, with its last work stoppage occurring in March 1993. 
Human Capital Management
The Company recognizes that its success would not be possible without the valuable contributions of its workforce. Investment in people enables the Company to accomplish its goals and deliver innovative customer solutions. The Company’s corporate Human Capital strategy is overseen by its Chief Human Resource Officer (“CHRO”). Annually, the CHRO presents a talent review to the Company’s Board of Directors. As part of the review, the team details each enterprise-level senior leadership position and outlines succession plans to ensure the Board is informed of the Company’s plans for business continuity and success.
The Company’s workforce advancement strategy succeeds through investment in three pillars: skill-building for the entire workforce, leadership development aligned with the Company’s methodology and fostering a great culture. The Company’s approach to training and education helps drive long-term value by providing employees with opportunities to develop skills both individually and as teams:
•Employees have access to learning through a variety of sources, including the IDEX Academy, which is the primary platform for global leadership development programs, local development programs and specific individual development plans. These trainings also help to develop future and potential leaders in the IDEX leadership methodology. 
•The Company also enables employee development and growth by offering full-time U.S. employees who have at least six months of service the ability to participate in the Tuition Reimbursement program. Through the program, employees can have certain expenses from secondary educational institutions reimbursed up to $5,250 per year. 
•The Company also built the IDEX Accelerating Management Potential (“I-AMP”) Collegiate Talent Program in 2018 to give early career professionals the opportunity to learn the Company’s values and business, and to grow within the Company in both full-time and internship roles. Since the program began, over 78 percent of participants have represented either gender or racial minority groups, and the Company will continue its focus on providing opportunities for diverse early career professionals. 
•The Company prioritizes hiring team members who will embrace the team-driven culture and also places considerable emphasis on leveraging the talented employees within the Company’s internal pipeline, filling many leadership positions with Company employees. 
•Across the enterprise, the Company’s goal is to achieve manufacturing company top quartile employee engagement as measured by its engagement survey. Given the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the work environment, the Company is encouraged that employees are staying engaged as it remains in the top quartile among manufacturing companies with employee engagement at 76 percent. 
Employee Pay and Benefits
Attracting and retaining top talent is critical to the success of the Company’s business. The Company offers a highly competitive pay and benefits package for employees in all the markets where it operates. The performance-based pay packages provide many employees with short-term performance incentives. The Company also provides equity-based, long-term incentives to its senior leaders. In 2021, many of the Company’s business units took proactive action with off-cycle pay rate increases for hourly employees as the labor dynamics tightened. The Company increased its 2022 compensation budgets as related to previous years to maintain its focus on retaining key talent. 
The Company’s U.S. employees can participate in a 401(k) retirement plan and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows an employee to purchase IDEX stock through payroll deductions. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
The Company has always recognized diversity as foundational to creativity and resilience; the three pillars of Innovation, Diversity and Excellence form the acronym that is the Company’s name, IDEX. Gender, ethnic, cultural and other human diversity is critical to the Company’s success. 
In 2021, the Company hired a Vice President, Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) Officer (“CDO”) reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Subsequently, the CDO engaged the executive leadership team and Board of Directors to finalize a three-year DE&I High Level Strategy and Tactics road map. Our Board of Directors regularly reviews DE&I progress. In 2021, the Board of Directors also added its first African American member. 
In 2021, the Company increased its number of senior leaders who are racially diverse by 28%. The Company also saw a 5% increase in people managers that are racially diverse. Women in senior leadership and management roles held steady in 2021. As a part of the DE&I strategic roadmap, in 2022 the Company plans to: 1) hire a global DE&I team; 2) embed DE&I metrics into Executive Leadership Team goals and compensation; 3) review diverse talent quarterly with business leaders; 4) implement a company-wide inclusive leadership development plan; and 5) actively benchmark progress against competitors and DE&I best practice partners.
Further, the Company has been conducting pay equity analyses for U.S. employees since 2018 to ensure that employees’ actual pay was substantially similar to their predicted pay. Where appropriate, the Company provided base pay adjustments for employees that were outliers from their predicted pay, further reinforcing the Company’s commitment to diversity and a culture of inclusion, equality and respect. 
Workplace Health & Safety
The Company is proud to manufacture highly engineered products, including many that have life-saving benefits. Doing this would not be possible without the systems the Company has developed and implemented to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, and those who work in the Company’s locations. The first part of this system is the IDEX Employee Health and Safety (“EHS”) Policy which outlines the Company’s vision to provide an injury free workplace for employees and prevent pollution of the environment. This is supplemented by the Company’s EHS Framework in which the Company defines the three pillars of its EHS system, and the nine elements that reside under these pillars. These two documents underpin EHS at IDEX and assist leadership and employees in meeting the Company’s vision. 
The Company also encourages all full-time employees enrolled in the U.S. Healthcare Benefit Plan to participate in the third-party operated Wellness Program which provides access to annual biometric screenings, health evaluations and wellness credits that can be earned for meeting individual wellness goals each year. A number of the business units organize complementary wellness programs, including walking clubs, health fairs and lunch and learns with nutritionists for their employees. 
The Company continued to remain vigilant with its employees’ health and safety in 2021 as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the policies and procedures that were implemented in 2020 were continued or modified as the situation dictated. 
Worker Rights and Protection
The Company believes that a respectful workplace is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment, and this involves more than just compliance with the law. The Company strives to create a work environment that is free of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior and consistent with the Company’s values – a place where everyone is invited to do their best every day and feel free to report any concerns. The Company has policies, procedures and regular training in place to protect its workforce and prevent workplace harassment and discrimination. This includes a global Code of Business Conduct & Ethics policy where employees agree to follow and receive annual training. The Company also maintains a global hotline where employees are encouraged (and can choose to remain anonymous) to report any concerns or issues.
