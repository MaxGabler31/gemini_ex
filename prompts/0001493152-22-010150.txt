BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”, “Grapefruit”, “GBI”, or “the Company”) was formed as a California corporation on August 28, 2017 and began operation in September 2017. On July 10, 2019, Grapefruit acquired Imaging3, Inc. (“IGNG”) in a reverse acquisition (the “Acquisition”). Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, IGNG issued to Grapefruit’s existing shareholders approximately 81% of the post-Acquisition IGNG common shares and the IGNG shareholders retained 19% of the post-Acquisition IGNG common shares. As a result, our financial statements are prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with Grapefruit as the accounting acquirer and IGNG treated as the legal acquirer and accounting acquiree. On December 16, 2019, Grapefruit filed the necessary paperwork with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and OTC Markets to effect the Company Name and Ticker symbol changes from “IGNG” to “GPFT” formally changing our corporate name from Imgaing3, Inc. to Grapefruit USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is trading under the Ticker Symbol “GPFT”.
 
The Company holds its annual distribution licensure which allows us to operate through June 14, 2022. Our annual manufacturing license has been renewed by the California Department of Health. Grapefruit has not yet applied for a license to cultivate and will not until construction of our cultivation facility has been substantially completed. We own two acres of fully entitled cannabis real property located in the Coachillin’ Industrial Cultivation and Ancillary Canna-Business Park where we intend to build a 30,000 square foot fully licensed cannabis facility. The location within Coachillin’ allows the Company to apply for and hold every cannabis license available under the California Cannabis laws.
 
In July 2021, Grapefruit obtained a development permit to build a 30,000 square foot “Mothership” facility intended to house a state-of-the-art indoor grow as well as a separately licensed distribution hub and laboratory that will produce the patented Hourglass line of topical creams as well as high quality extracts from trim generated by processing the indoor grow. We intend to obtain CGMP  certification for the lab pursuant to the Good Manufacturing Practice regulations enforced by the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”). We expect that our facility will meet proper design, monitoring, and control of our manufacturing processes to assure the strength, quality, and purity of all Hourglass products manufactured by us during the construction. We anticipate the FDA mandating all cannabis facilities be CGMP certified to continue in operation once cannabis is federally legalized. Obtaining CGMP certification will make the eventual federalization of cannabis a very smooth transition for our company because most of what is required by the FDA will be already addressed and implemented at our facility.
 
Auctus Fund Financing
 
On May 31, 2019, the Company executed the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Auctus Fund pursuant to the terms of which the Company agreed to sell $4,000,000 of the Notes and issue $6,200,000 of callable warrants (the “Warrants” and, together with the Notes, the “Securities”) to Auctus. Auctus is the Selling Security Holder. In addition, on May 31, 2019, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Auctus (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) whereby we are obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of the shares underlying the Securities. On July 25, 2019 (as amended on January 17, 2020), a registration statement was filed to comply with the Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the SPA, Auctus became obligated to purchase the $4,000,000 of Notes from Grapefruit in four tranches as follows: $600,000 at the SPA closing, which was funded on June 6, 2019; the second tranche of $1,422,750 on the day IGNG filed the registration statement, which was funded on August 16, 2019; the third tranche of $1,030,000 was funded the day the SEC declares the registration statement effective and the fourth tranche of $1 million was funded 90 days after effectiveness. As of December 31, 2021, all tranches of this financing were completed. The Company has received gross proceeds of $4,052,750. On August 23, 2021, an updated registration statement was filed to comply with the Registration Rights Agreement.
 
On April 15, 2021, the Company and Auctus Fund agreed to a fixed conversion price regarding all Notes at $0.075 (the “Global Amendment”) subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company’s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events. Furthermore, in consideration of the Global Amendment, Auctus was granted cash Warrants by the Company for the purchase of 20,000,000 shares of the Company at an exercise price of $0.075 per share. The effective date of the Global Amendment is December 31, 2020.

Industry Overview
 
Global consumer spending on legal cannabis in 2018 showed a growth rate of 20 percent in sales of cannabis in regulated markets. Cannabis sales are on track to increase 36 percent to $14.9 billion in 2019 and reach $40 billion by 2024 according to the “State of Legal Cannabis Markets” Report released by Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. This report points to growth in the cannabis markets while underlining the challenges that face the sector. The “Total Cannabinoid Market” (“TCM”) in the United States, which includes medical and recreational cannabis sales in regulated dispensaries, plus sales of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals and hemp-based CBD products.
 
Most notably, in 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GW Pharmaceutical’s Epidiolex and passed the 2018 Farm Bill legalizing hemp and cannabidiol oil derived from hemp as long as it contained less than 0.3% THC. According to State of Legal Cannabis Markets, 7th Edition, by Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics, the 2018 Farm Bill allows pharmacies, extraction labs, and general retailers to sell CBD-based products in all 50 states, which is expected to enhance the TCM. In the U.S. alone, sales of CBD products in all channels are expected to reach $20 billion by 2024.
 
In 2018 the legal cannabis industry experienced one of its slowest annual expansion rates since Colorado launched the adult-use era in 2014.
 
In California, its legal spending on cannabis fell, from $3 billion in 2017 to $2.5 billion, in the year in which it implemented an adult-use regulatory regime. A key takeaway from the California market is that highly restrictive regulations and high tax rates are hurting the legal market’s ability to compete with the illicit market. The barriers to enter into the legal cannabis market are also increasing in California because its temporary cannabis licensing scheme has ended. Currently any license applicant must now wait a protracted amount of time before the applicant receives its license and must wait a year in some cases for the application to make its way through the local and state licensing authorities.
 
According to the “State of Legal Cannabis Markets” Report, other key trends in the United States Legal Cannabis Markets include:
 

● | Total legal cannabis spending in regulated dispensaries in the U.S. topped $9.8 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow to $30 billion in 2024, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Investment capital raised by cannabis companies more than quadrupled to $14 billion in 2018, according to Viridian Capital Advisors. 
● | Despite a 55 percent decline in 2018 in New Cannabis Ventures’ Global Cannabis Stock Index, the five largest Canadian licensed producers closed the first quarter of 2019 at a combined market capitalization of $48 billion. 
● | A total of 13 state markets will have passed the $1 billion mark in total annual legal cannabis spending by the end of 2024—by the end of 2018, only three had done so (California, Colorado and Washington).

Grapefruit’s Competitive Advantage in the Industry
 
In December 2020, we shifted our corporate focus becoming an innovative cannabiotech company following the successful development of our patented Hourglass™ Time Release THC+CBD-Infused Topical Cream. Hourglass is the first and only patented Full Spectrum THC+ Cannabinoid Topical Cream that provides its users with a full body, synergistic entourage effect that was only available by smoking, vaping or consuming cannabis. Our Topical Cream is scientifically designed to deliver the full effects of THC combined with a broad range of cannabinoids for your overall health, wellness, and well-being. Laboratory tested with complete results available on every package via a designated QR Code. There is no other topical cream product on the market with our patented technology that provides users with the holistic benefits of the entourage effect of THC+CBD, CBN, CBG, Delta8, THCV and CBE. Hourglass™ is currently available in licensed retail and mobile cannabis dispensaries in Central California and Los Angeles County, California. USA. Hourglass™ is not intended for use to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and we are not claiming otherwise.
 
In July 2022, we decided to bring our patented Hourglass™ Time Release THC+CBD-Infused Topical Cream to the federally legalized Canadian cannabis marketplace. In January 2022, the company’s licensed Canadian distribution partner Medz Cannabis filed a Notice of New Cannabis Product (“NNCP”) with Health Canada on Grapefruit’s behalf for its Hourglass THC+CBD Topical cream. Health Canada is the Canadian federal government department that is responsible for national health policy. It approves and oversees the production of all cannabis products and is the licensing authority for all companies involved in the cannabis industry. Health Canada requires that all cannabis products meet federal regulatory requirements before they can be sold in Canada. Under Canada’s Federal Cannabis Regulatory scheme, Health Canada must be notified of a company’s intent to sell a cannabis product that has not previously been sold in the country. Approval of the NNCP is a mandatory prerequisite to the launch of Grapefruit’s Hourglass technology-based products in Canada.
 
On March 21, 2022, Health Canada approved the Company’s NNCP application authorizing Grapefruit to sell its patented Hourglass™ Time Release THC+CBD-Infused Topical Cream to licensed retail outlets throughout Canada under NNCP ID No. NP-V2EHUWO907.
 
Grapefruit holds its State of California annual licensing from the Bureau of Cannabis Control and the California Department of Public Health. The Company has its permanent annually renewable licensure as opposed to a provisional or temporary license. The Company has found the annual renewal to be a non-intrusive and scaled down as opposed to what the renewal process was previously. The Company is one of the earliest registered distribution companies with the State of California to have an annually renewable license as opposed to the provisional licenses previously granted.
 
On January 1, 2019, the State of California eliminated the temporary cannabis licensing scheme. The regulatory changes have impacted the ability of new businesses to enter the marketplace and compete with Grapefruit. However, none of Grapefruit’s commercial cannabis businesses have been impacted by the regulatory changes to the marketplace.
 
Grapefruit chose to operate within the Coachillin’ Industrial Cultivation and Ancillary Canna-Business Park (the “Park”), located in Desert Hot Springs, California, 14 miles north of downtown Palm Springs. The Park is the first and largest cooperative canna-business compound of its kind. It is unique in that the landowners each own a proportionate interest in a collaborative owner’s association, which allows them to share much of the park overhead such as clean cultivation water, park security and access to agricultural power rates. Grapefruit understood the State’s regulatory burdens and expense for commercial cannabis businesses to successfully operate. For example, the State requires cannabis business to provide 24 hour-per-day on-site armed security for their facility. This is a shared expense of the property Coachillin property owners. In addition, Coachillin property owners pay agricultural power rates of sixteen (16) cents per kilowatt hour which is significantly less than what others pay for power. The location within Coachillin allows the Company to apply for and hold every cannabis license available under the California Cannabis laws.
 
Distribution
 
Grapefruit initially obtained its California wholesale recreational and medicinal cannabis distribution license on January 4, 2018. Thereafter, Grapefruit met all of its ongoing regulatory requirements and was granted an annual distribution license. The Company will continue to be a premier manufacturer and distributor of legal cannabis products in California.

In California, cannabis cultivators and manufactures are prohibited from selling their products – e.g., topicals, flowers or edibles - directly into the marketplace. These companies are required to use a licensed distributor, such as Grapefruit. Grapefruit’s distribution license affords it a twofold strategic advantage: first, to market and sell its own cannabis product lines to retailers throughout California; and second to buy and resell bulk cannabis oil, flower and trim as an unfettered middleman to any properly licensed customer anywhere in California that it identifies a profit opportunity.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company owns a fully licensed ethanol extraction facility in the City of Desert Hot Springs, CA. The Company owns and operates a Type 6 Ethanol Extraction Plant which removes the essential cannabis compounds, such as THC Distillate, that we, and others use, to produce cannabis products.
 
Grapefruit manufactures its patented Hourglass™ Time Release THC+CBD-Infused Topical Cream at its facility allowing it to maintain strict quality control standards. In addition, Grapefruit’s extraction lab produces high quality distillate or “Honey Oil” from trim that Grapefruit sources utilizing its distribution license as set forth above. THC Honey Oil is a fundamental cannabis commodity which serves as the active ingredient in products from infused edibles to tinctures/creams to the cartridges used in vapes or e-cigarettes. Honey Oil sells in the wholesale marketplace at approximately $2,250 to $3,250 per liter. Pricing is dependent on quantity purchased as well as other market factors such as the availability and cost of the underlying trim – the raw cannabis material from which Grapefruit produces oil. The Company decided to manufacture its own RSO (“Rick Simpson Oil”) infused product line. Grapefruit chose to set up its extraction laboratory in the City of Desert Hot Springs because the City does not tax the manufacture of oil by Grapefruit at its Desert Hot Springs extraction facility, thereby providing Grapefruit with an additional competitive advantage.
 
Branding
 
We package and brand cannabis products. One of the key elements to our branding strategy is performing an analysis on a product’s competitor(s) currently in the retail space and working to make our product stand out. We work on pricing strategies, boutique branding elements and other ways to differentiate when shelf space gets limited and retailers slow down on taking certain product classes.
Hourglass™ Time Release THC+CBD-Infused Topical Cream
 
The Company is currently manufacturing, marketing, and selling its patented Hourglass™ Time Release THC+CBD-Infused Topical Cream throughout California. Hourglass is the only Full Spectrum THC+ Cannabinoid Topical Cream that provides its users with a full body, synergistic entourage effect that was only available by smoking, vaping or consuming cannabis. This is the first and only patented Topical Cream that scientifically delivers the full effects of THC combined with a broad range of cannabinoids for your overall health, wellness, and well-being. Laboratory tested with complete results available on every package via a designated QR Code. There is no other topical cream product on the market with our patented technology that provides users with the holistic benefits of the entourage effect of THC+CBD, CBN, CBG, Delta8, THCV and CBE. Users will no longer be prevented from enjoying the many benefits of cannabis without eating an edible, using a tincture or lighting a joint, pipe or vape and will be able to discreetly apply additional cream for any desired effect. Hourglass™ is currently available in licensed retail and mobile cannabis dispensaries in Central California and Los Angeles County, California. USA. Hourglass™ is not intended for use to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and we are not claiming otherwise.
 
The Company has also developed a 2018 Farm Bill compliant hemp-based CBD version of Hourglass™ which is currently being sold on its e-commerce website, www.hourglassonlinestore.com. The 2018 Farm Bill compliant hemp version of Hourglass™ contains no THC whatsoever which allows for greater flexibility to market and sell this version in traditional sale’s channels. The Hemp-derived version of Hourglass™ is not intended for use to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and we are not claiming otherwise.

Summit Boys
 
In August 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement acquiring the majority ownership and control of Summit Boys, Inc., a very well-known and established cannabis extraction brand with product lines in retail stores throughout the State of California. The Company plans on continuing the business without interruption and plans on licensing the Summit Boys brand in the State of Oklahoma under that State’s newly enacted legalized statutory scheme for cannabis products. This non-significant and non-operating subsidiary has been consolidated with Grapefruit’s financial statements. As consideration, the Company issued 4,545,455 shares of common stock for 51% ownership if Summit Boys, Inc.
 
Summit Boys premium extracts include sugar, crumble, badder, live resin, diamonds, budder, sauce, caviar and other extracted cannabis products, which are currently placed in licensed dispensaries throughout California and are protected by United States of America Trademark Reg. No. 6406802, July 6, 2021.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company filed trademark and service mark applications with the State of California to protect its Company name as well as its Rainbow Dreams and Sugar Stoned cannabis product names. The Company received the following Registration Statements from the California Secretary of State:

1. | On August 20, 2019, the Secretary of State of the State of California issued the Company its Registration of Service Mark, Registration No. Y1GZNV6, for its corporate name, Grapefruit, thereby protecting its Service Mark and line of business from other competitors within the industry.

4. | On February 4, 2021, the Secretary of State of the State of California issued to Grapefruit its Registration of Trademark, Registration Nos. 02009331 and 02009332, for its Hourglass patented time release THC + Cannabinoid delivery cream under “Cannabis infused skin cream.” The term of the Trademark Registrations extends to and includes February 3, 2026. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. | On July 6, 2021, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a Trademark protecting the Summit Boys Brand under Registration No. 6406802. 

 
The Company currently maintains a portfolio of trade secrets relating to the formulas for its patented Hourglass topical creams, CBD gummies, vaporization cartridges and oils as well as its proprietary manufacturing process for its Hourglass line of topical creams.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
We have retained employees with cannabis-related experience in product manufacturing, branding, marketing and retail sales in the State of California. We have a strategic relationship with a full service traditional and digital marketing agency that will promote our company and products. We have a multi-pronged approach to marketing our Company and its branded product lines: (1) social media – including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter; (2) influencers who are expected to promote our branded products directly to recreational cannabis users; (3) attendance at specific industry events that are designed to promote our company to both macro and micro targeted audiences; (4) static marketing (e.g., well placed bill board advertising); and (5) use of an outside sales force for the personal touch required to obtain shelf-space in all recreational and medicinal dispensaries.

Additionally, the Company maintains an online digital platform where customers may purchase the Company’s products.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
 
In general, raw materials essential to our business are readily available from multiple sources. We have been able to source the materials required to manufacture our entire line of branded products Our products use both non-cannabis and cannabis raw materials. We have the entire United States for the sourcing non-cannabis raw materials – such as terpenes, which are the compounds from plant extracts that provide the unique flavor profile in cannabis products, and cells, which are the industry standard vaporization carts. The California cannabis marketplace is diverse, and we have developed the relationships with other companies to ensure the consistent availability of the raw materials.
 
Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems, or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
 
Competition
 
The cannabis industry is subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. We may experience significant competitive pricing pressures as well as competitive products and services providers. Several significant competitors may offer products and/or services with prices that may match or are lower than ours. We believe that the products and services we offer are generally competitive with those offered by other cannabis companies. It is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant research advantage over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in research and shifts in customer preferences away from natural supplements could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Additionally, CBD is a naturally occurring cannabinoid constituent of cannabis. It was discovered in 1940 and is known to exhibit neuroprotective properties in many experimental systems. However, development of CBD as a drug has been confounded by the following: 1) low potency; 2) a large number of molecular targets; 3) marginal pharmacokinetic properties; and 4) designation as a schedule 1 controlled substance. We view that companies specializing in the sale, distribution and manufacturing of CBD based products as some of our stronger competitors based on recent laws and regulatory schemes.
 
Government Approvals and Regulations
 
The formulation, manufacturing, processing, labelling, packaging, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by several federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. The FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labelling and distribution of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbs) and cosmetics, whereas the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate the advertising of these products.
 
The FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged and held in compliance with strict rules, and require quality control provisions similar to those in the GMP regulations for drugs. The FDA could in the future choose to inspect one of our facilities for compliance with these regulations and could cause non-compliant products made or held in the facility to be subject to FDA enforcement actions.

-

 

The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA and their regulation of foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics may increase or become more restrictive in the future. Additional legislation could be passed which would impose substantial new regulatory requirements for dietary supplements, potentially raising our costs and hindering our business. We do not believe our current products are subject to the FDCA as our products are not intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease.
 
Our advertising is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of dietary supplement and weight loss products and companies. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labelling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class action certifications, seek class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any of these types of adverse actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition to FDA and FTC regulations, our products may face further regulation under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining marketing approval for our products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be marketed or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In the case of countries with similar obstacles, we would be unable to market our product candidates in countries in the near future or perhaps at all if the laws and regulations in those countries do not change.
 
Additionally, the Company is also subject to California law regarding dissemination of information via advertising. Mainly, these rules and regulations relate to directing advertisements to people aged 21 years and older. The type of advertising the Company expects to conduct and pursue is similar to how alcohol companies direct their advertising and marketing efforts.
 
Controlled Substance Regulation
 
At some point our products may be developed and be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, both during clinical development and post approval, and our financial condition.
 
Certain products we may develop could contain controlled substances as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, not currently “accepted medical use” in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription. We do not intend to produce “controlled substances” at this time due to regulatory complications.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 9 full-time employees. Grapefruit has 3 employees at its lab facilities. One of the lab employees is responsible for managing onsite operations at the Warehouse. The Company has 3 outside salespeople located in Northern California. These salespeople manage the marketing and sales of Grapefruit’s Summit Boys extract product lines. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups at this point in time, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, legal compliance and other services on an as needed basis.
