THE COMPANY

Gratitude Health, Inc., (the “Company”) manufactures, sells and markets functional RTD (Ready to Drink) beverages sold under the Gratitude trademark. The Company’s first five drinks are Chinese Dragon Well Green Teas. Second and third functional-drink lines are now in development. The Gratitude mission is to disrupt this beverage market through our manufacturing and marketing of functional beverages that specifically promote healthy aging and to never produce a product that in any way will adversely affect the health of our customer. The Gratitude vision is to work with research partners to develop functional drinks that can easily be incorporated into one’s daily lifestyle and fit their nutritional goals.
THE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING:
 
Gratitude Health, Inc. is building the “Gratitude” brand with the launch of unique, naturally flavored and unsweetened RTD (Ready To Drink) teas.
 
Today, tea is the second largest drink category in America and is an obvious driver and mainstay in delivery systems across food and beverage categories. Americans and, especially Millennial Americans, are increasingly becoming more and more aware of the generous levels of cancer-fighting antioxidants found in tea.
 
While Green, White and Black teas are the most common types consumed in America, research shows that their growth is solid year-over-year but barely above flat. We believe this is due to two factors:
 

● | The category is staid and boring and, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
● | RTD teas are not delivering on their health promises. 

 
We are addressing these issues with unique varieties of tea that not only have interesting and curious names but also health research that supports their benefits. Naturally, we will be calorie and carb free and always strive for maximum antioxidant delivery. Our teas are sourced from Dragon Well in China. Our initial five flavors are:
 

● | Wildberry 
--+-----------------
● | Blood Orange 
● | Mint 
● | Original 
● | Peach

Supporting these unique flavors and key to our brand-building presentation will be our package, a first-to- RTD-market “mason jar” like 16-oz bottle featuring artistic, graphic designs actually etched onto the glass-container.
 
We will promote this unique presentation as more than eco-friendly (“eco” being of great importance to millennials) because they will be collectibles and advertised as such thus making their collectability and reuse arguably the eco-friendliest mass-market beverage bottle in the world. To even further support this unique presentation, artistic and colorful labels (logo, art, nutritional and redemption information) will cover the etchings driving the desires for those that keep them to buy their “missing” collectible.
 
Interestingly, the 2017 Natural Beverage Guide (Bevnet, Inc.) displays hundreds of Natural-Drink companies and not one has a “Mason” jar configuration. We believe this packaging will be widely preferred to the predominantly plastic bottles in the market today, we further expect modern consumers to understand and appreciate the flavor profile and obvious nutritional benefits of the teas.
  
Having identified the opportunity and clearly focused upon the healthy features and benefits available in Gratitude’s tea offerings, Gratitude has introduce its first five flavors of tea into the New York City market.
 
The Company is continuing its development plan for 2019: (1) pursuing additional distributors for our Dragon Well Tea brands on the east coast of the United States; and (2) launching and distributing KetoFuel™ a ready-to-drink line of ketogenic meal-replacement shakes in shelf-stable Tetra Pak containers. We have engaged a leading scientist with advanced studies into the ketogenic diet to create this proprietary and strategically balanced fat-to-protein-to-carbohydrate, macro-nutrient formulation that refuels and supports the body’s ability to naturally burn fat for energy and maintain consumers already in ketosis. KetoFuel™ is the ultimate meal replacement drink and is created to deliver healthy nutrition for all. Each “keto shake” delivers proper macro and micro nutrients in a scientifically developed balance of healthy fat, protein and carb ratios. KetoFuel™ is USDA Organic and will come in 16.9 oz, shelf-stable Tetra Pak Prisma containers and will be sold across multiple beverage channels.

MARKET INFORMATION AND THE VALUE CHAIN AND ROUTES TO MARKET
 
According to Beverage Marketing Corporation’s 2017 “DrinkTell” database, RTD tea sales totaled $10.31 billion in 2017 up four percent. Importantly, Gratitude’s market analyses and product development targets the main attributes fueling this growth. According to this database, “Ready-to-drink tea is leading the growth in its category with new forms and formulations that offer both function and flavor. Consumers are willing to trade up to products that offer them better quality or benefits.” Further according to BMC, “Retailers say refrigerated RTD teas are the leading segment in this category, and new varieties are emerging. In the RTD tea category, reduced-sugar formulations and local and artisanal brands are poised for continued growth.”
 
We are the first company to introduce Chinese Dragon Well Tea to the mass RTD American market. Dragon Well is subtle in taste with a hint of chestnut and is the most popular tea in China being granted “Imperial” status. Because it is “Green”, our tea will be well known to the US consumer. Because it is “DragonWell”, it will be a welcome new experience to the US RTD market. All our teas are either low calorie--45 per 16z—or totally unsweetened. Our “small batch * handmade” brand positioning features totally unique and first-to-market packaging that meets artisanal characteristics influencing today’s consumer purchase.
 
According to the Tea Association of the USA, in its 2017-2018 Tea Market Review and Forecast, Ready-to-drink (RTD) tea accounted for some 45.7% of the tea market share in 2017 and will exceed 1.7 billion gallons in 2017. The Review states “Specialty Tea is still driving interest and consumption in the category with consumers grazing for new and different options and flavors and origins. Sustainability of these high quality, higher priced teas confirms that the analogy to wine is stronger than ever.” Furthermore, according to the Tea Association: “Naturalness continues to drive consumers who demand foods that are closer to their unrefined or pure state, seeking “less processed” drinks, incentivizing companies to remove artificial ingredients. This trend will also encourage consumers to reach for foods in their most natural, original form, such as true teas, for health benefits, instead of supplements and nutraceuticals. Tea is a natural, simple and whole food.”
 
By marrying a famous and revered green tea in China with such organic flavors as Peach, Mint, Wildberry and Blood Orange and putting those complementary flavors in a totally unique glass package, Gratitude is well positioned for our targeted consumer audience.
 
Gratitude’s retail shelf price is between $2.99 to $3.49 per bottle. We have established cost for finished product per bottle and per 12-count case. We will approach and engage the same retail systems and value chain structure relative to all RTD beverage brands in the industry.
 
There will be three routes to market:
 

1. | Direct-to-Retail sales (grocery, big box, and drug chains). 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Direct Store Delivery (DSD) with shelf management for C-stores, specialty accounts, and such institutions as colleges and universities. 
3. | Direct-to-Consumer sales via the internet. We will partner with Amazon for fulfillment. 


· | ● | Value chain for channel one includes delivered pricing from Gratitude direct to the retailer. We will target a suggested retail price in these accounts. Knowing that these accounts demand net delivery to their warehouses and a SET gross margin, Gratitude will price cases at wholesale to this channel of trade at a set price per bottle per cost of goods sold as calculated so that the Company has already calculated its margin less cost of freight for delivery. 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ● | Sales to DSD delivery systems require a more competitive wholesale price and higher retail price, which enables a structure where a distributor can earn a meaningful margin in an extremely competitive environment. The DSD retail customer is often a C-Store or Specialty store that requires regular deliveries and in-store management of inventory in “reaches”, meaning that often the DSD merchandises the shelf for his customer. This service cost is passed to the wholesaler. Therefore, to accommodate this pricing model, Gratitude must be more competitively priced to the DSD. The retailer also needs room to mark up the brand to accommodate their gross margin goals. So, Gratitude will reduce its gross margin in this channel and the DSD distributor will expect a set gross margin. The C-Store retailer usually expects a minimum set gross margin at his level. 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ● | The third sales model is direct consumer sales through the internet. These sales are always made by the case with an added delivery fee to the individual. We will partner with Amazon to handle orders and fulfillment and simply deliver to their regional warehouses. These sales provide great opportunity for gross margin having eliminated the distributor and retailer margin, but require significant digital marketing programs and advertising. We will use this channel immediately to service consumers that have heard of the brand but can’t find it at their local store yet. We know this channel will not be a large business initially but, as the brand grows, we plan to build this segment aggressively.
