ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
SurgePays, Inc. (“SurgePays”, “we”, “our” or “the Company”), incorporated in Nevada on August 18, 2006, is a technology and telecommunications company providing essential financial services and prepaid products to the underbanked and underserved communities.
About SurgePays, Inc.
 
SurgePays, Inc. is a financial technology and telecom company focused on providing essential services to the underbanked community. The Company’s blockchain fintech platform utilizes a suite of financial and prepaid products to convert corner stores into tech-hubs for underbanked neighborhoods. The Company’s telecom subsidiaries provide mobile broadband, voice and SMS text messaging to both subsidized and direct retail prepaid customers.
 
SurgePhone Wireless and LocoRabbit Wireless
 
SurgePhone, a wholly owned subsidiary of SurgePays, is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) company with 2 branded channels of business. SurgePhone is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) to provide subsidized mobile broadband services to consumers qualifying under the federal guidelines of the Affordable Connectivity Program (the “ACP”). The ACP (the successor program, as of March 1, 2022 to the Emergency Broadband Benefit program) provides SurgePhone up to a $100 reimbursement for the cost of each tablet device distributed and a $30 per customer, per month subsidy for mobile broadband (internet connectivity) services. SurgePhone has received approval to offer subsidized mobile broadband in these 14 states: California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas.
 
LocoRabbit is the retail pure prepaid wireless offering with talk, text, and 4G LTE data at prices that are lower than other well-known prepaid competitors. Available nationwide, LocoRabbit is sold online direct to consumers through the nationwide network of convenience stores, gas stations, mini-marts, bodegas and tiendas connected to the SurgePays software platform. The SIM kits usually hang from a peg hook on the SurgePays gift card rack. Due to owning the payment platform, SurgePays is able to exclusively offer an industry high commission to the retailer for top-ups paid monthly at the client’s store.

SurgePays Fintech (ECS Business)
 
We refer to the collective operations of ECS Prepaid, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company, Electronic Check Services, Inc., a Missouri corporation, and Central States Legal Services, Inc., a Missouri corporation, as “SurgePays Fintech.” This was previously referred to as the “ECS Business.”
 
SurgePays Fintech has been a financial technology tech and wireless top-up platform for over 15 years. Through a series of transactions between October 2019 and January 2020, we acquired the ECS Business primarily for the favorable ACH banking relationship; a fintech transactions platform processing over 20,000 transactions a day at approximately 8,000 independently owned retail stores. The goal was to incorporate our blockchain components into the existing ECS Business network. As of January 1, 2021, we believe the ECS Business platform has been successfully merged into our platform with secure ledger data backups and will continue to serve as the proven backbone for wireless top-up transactions and wireless product aggregation for the SurgePays nationwide network.
 
Surge Blockchain
 
SurgePays Blockchain Software is a back-office marketplace platform offering wholesale consumable goods direct to convenience stores, bodegas, minimarts, tiendas and other corner stores who are transacting on the SurgePays Fintech platform. The wholesale e-commerce platform is easily accessed through the secure app interface – similar to a website. We believe what makes this sales platform unique is that it also offers the merchant the ability to order wholesale consumable goods at a significant discount from traditional distributors with one touch ease. We are able to sell products at a significant discount by using on demand Direct Store Delivery (DSD.) Our platform is connected directly to manufactures, who ship products direct to the store while cutting out the middleman. The goal of the SurgePays Portal is to leverage the competitive advantage and efficiencies of e-commerce to provide as many commonly sold consumable products as possible to convenience stores, corner markets, bodegas, and supermarkets while increasing profit margins for these stores. These products include herbal stimulants, energy pills and shot drinks, dry foods, communication accessories, novelties, PPP products, bagged snacks, processed meats, automotive parts and many more goods, all in one convenient wholesale e-commerce platform.


LogicsIQ, Inc.
 
LogicsIQ, Inc. is a software development company providing marketing business intelligence (“BI”), lead generation, and case management solutions primarily to law firms in the mass tort industry. The company’s CRM “Intake Logics” facilitates the entire life cycle of converting a potential lead into a signed retainer client integrated into the law firms case management software. Our proven strategy of delivering cost-effective retained cases to our attorney and law firm clients means those clients are better able to manage their media and advertising budgets and reach targeted audiences more quickly and effectively when utilizing our proprietary data driven analytics dashboards. Our ability to deliver transparent results has bolstered our reputation as an industry leader and solidified a solid client base.
 
On February 14, 2022, we confidentially submitted an amended draft registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC relating to an initial public offering of LogicsIQ’s common stock. If, after the SEC completes its review process, and subject to market and other conditions, the registration statement is declared effective and the initial public offering closes, LogicsIQ will still remain majority owned by SurgePays.
 
Centercom
 
Since 2019, we have owned a 40% equity interest in Centercom Global, S.A. de C.V. (“Centercom”). Centercom is a bilingual operations center providing the Company with sales support, customer service, IT infrastructure design, graphic media, database programming, software development, revenue assurance, lead generation, and other various operational support services. Centercom is based in El Salvador.
 
As the Company announced on March 24, 2022 via the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K, Anthony P. Nuzzo, Jr., the Company’s President, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Chief Executive Officer of LogicsIQ, a subsidiary of which we own over 90%, died suddenly on March 18, 2022. The entire Company mourns this terrible loss.
 
Mr. Nuzzo owned 50% of Centercom.

The strategic acquisition of a bilingual operations hub has powered the Company’s rapid growth and revenue. After acquiring ownership in Centercom, SurgePays has built out the infrastructure required to scale in synergy and efficiency to support the Company’s hyper growth sales and customer growth.
 

Experienced Leadership Team
 
Our management team consists of 3 executives with over 20 years in the prepaid wireless, underbanked and convenience store distribution industry while presiding over companies with a collective revenue run of over $2 Billion. Our finance team is led by a CFO with a background in private equity backed, and publicly traded companies ranging from $100 million to over $1.3 billion in annual revenue while our software development team is led by a CTO who got his start in the early days of operating systems. We believe the combination of operating skills from our management team with the experience of successfully leading major multi-million-dollar, multinational companies give our organization a significant strength relative to most small- and medium-sized beverage companies.
Growth Strategies

Competition
 
Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. Most traditional convenience store distributors are companies that have been in business for over 50 years and utilize the historical “manufacturing plant to truck to warehouse to truck to store” logistics model. However, we believe that with our diverse product line, better efficiencies resulting in lower wholesale cost of goods sold, we have the ability to obtain a large market share and continue to generate sales growth and compete in the industry. The principal competitive factors in all our product markets are technical features, quality, availability, price, customer support, and distribution coverage. The relative importance of each of these factors varies depending on the region. We believe using our direct store distribution model nationwide will open significant opportunities for growth.
 
There are many competitors in the prepaid wireless and mobile broadband industry. We feel what makes SurgePhone different is we are a grassroots company with our products placed in the neighborhood stores where the underbanked shop. We can offer wireless services, through the corner stores, at a lower price to customers since we own the transaction software processing the activations and top-ups.
 
The markets in which we operate can be generally categorized as highly competitive. In order to maximize our competitive advantages, we continue to expand our product portfolio to capitalize on market trends, changes in technology and new product releases. Based on available data for our served markets, we estimate that our market share of the convenience store sales business at this time is less than 1%. A substantial acquisition would be necessary to meaningfully and rapidly change our market share percentage.
 
Distributors generally do not have a broad set of product and service offerings or capabilities, and no single distributor currently provides all the top selling consumables while offering products and services to enhance the lifestyle of the underbanked such as prepaid wireless, gift cards, bill payment and reloadable debit cards. We believe this creates a significant opportunity for a dynamic paradigm shift to a nationwide wholesale e-commerce platform.
 
Nationwide Product Deployment 
 
The SurgePays Blockchain platform streamlines the process for bringing products directly to the retail store. Our sales protocols have been tested and proven transferable from one product offering to another while ultimately providing our network of stores with better pricing and a larger product selection.
Competitive Edge
 
Our competitive edge is simple: we have the ability through our software platform, along with our relationships, capacity, efficiency, economies of scale and experience necessary to bring our financial services and prepaid products to the underbanked market in an effective and efficient manner to ensure success. Our sales protocols have been tested and proven transferable from one product offering to another while ultimately improving our target stores with better pricing and more product selection.
 
Our strategy for increasing revenues is based on developing, maintaining, and expanding our nationwide network of retail stores. Our relationship-driven approach to selling along with providing many of the top selling c-store products at a wholesale discount greater than traditional distributors gives management confidence of continued growth into the foreseeable future.
 
We have established relationships with distribution companies delivering significant sales per day for our subsidized mobile broadband product. This should increase as we add more states.

Research and Development Activities
 
We conduct research and development on an ongoing basis, including new and existing products to offer and software product development to ensure we are delivering the most efficient, secure, and fast transactions at the store level. The SurgePays software platform is housed on the Amazon Web Service Cloud for redundancy, stability, and reliability. Traditionally, convenience stores are high volume and fast paces stores where space at the register is at a premium, thus leaving no room for a computer so wireless top-ups or cell phone activations are done over a Verifone terminal traditionally used for processing credit cards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue the enhancement of our software platform and application to transact via tablets and other smaller devices while developing new products that meet or anticipate such changes in our served markets. Many of the stores we serve are now connected to the internet. This has allowed us to innovate our software to be more adaptive to equipment that is more compatible with the space constraints of the register area in a store.
 
Much of the development for specific products we offer is done by the manufacturers and is dictated by market conditions. For example: When the iPhone 12 was released, we simply added iPhone 12 chargers and adapters to its suite of smartphone accessories. Our continuity is secure due to our ability to adapt through adding new products seamlessly.
 
Seasonality
 
We experience some seasonality whereby the peak tax season months show a higher level of sales and consumption. However, the structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the peak tax season months in the spring have historically been approximately 5% greater than the peak other months, and as our product portfolio continues to expand, the level of seasonal peaks we expect to diminish.
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2022, our human capital resources consist of thirty-two (32) employees and approximately eight (8) independent contractors. Historically all salaries have been consolidated under SurgePays while contractor expenses are paid by the appropriate subsidiary. Since January 1, 2021, all salaries are allocated to the appropriate subsidiary.


We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
