Item 1. Business
Business Overview
We provide comprehensive data solutions designed to empower organizations across the semiconductor ecosystem to improve the yield and quality of their products and operational efficiency for increased profitability. Our offerings include proprietary software, professional services based on proven methodologies and using third-party cloud-hosting platforms for software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), electrical measurement hardware tools, and physical intellectual property (“IP”) for integrated circuit (“IC”) designs. We derive revenues from two sources, Analytics and Integrated Yield Ramp, by monetizing our offerings through contract fees for on-premise licenses, SaaS, and other professional services and a value-based, variable fee or royalty, which we call Gainshare, on our historical integrated yield ramp (“IYR”) engagements. Our products and services have been sold to integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, equipment manufacturers, electronics manufacturing suppliers (“EMS”), original device manufacturers (“ODMs”), out-sourced semiconductor assembly and test (“OSATs”), and system houses. We are headquartered in Santa Clara, California and also operate worldwide with offices in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
Our products and services are used by many Fortune 500 companies across the semiconductor ecosystem to achieve smart manufacturing goals by connecting and controlling equipment, collecting data generated during manufacturing and test operations, and performing advanced analytics and machine learning to enable profitable, high-volume manufacturing. For example, our foundry customers generate and analyze key manufacturing data using our solutions to shorten the time necessary for technology development and to provide their fabless customers with a higher yielding process with improved electrical performance, which are both critical metrics for market success. Higher yields in less time can also mean less total raw materials and process runs, which help lower customers’ total cost and minimize environmental impact. Also, for example, equipment manufacturers and factories use our connectivity products to implement evolving industry standards for their equipment or operations, respectively, with required quality and stability. By way of further example, our IDM and fabless customers use our solutions to generate unique, differentiated data that can be analyzed with our machine learning (or ML) and artificial intelligence (or AI) algorithms to predict downstream manufacturing issues, resulting in shorter time for designs to meet performance requirements with fewer iterations and faster time-to-market. For final example, our foundry and OSAT customers use the AI and ML applications of our software to optimize for process control, assembly, and/or test.
Our long-term business strategy is to be the data solutions provider of choice for the semiconductor and electronics ecosystems. To achieve this, we intend to:

● | Offer a Common, Flexible Platform for a Broad Group of Customers Across the Supply Chain. As semiconductor and electronics products are made with the efforts of equipment manufacturers, front end foundries, chip and system designers, design automation, IP providers, and OSATs, there is a need to analyze the data across this whole chain to optimize yields, operational efficiencies, time to market, quality, and reliability. The Exensio platform is designed to provide a common platform - whether deployed in the cloud (SaaS) or on premise - to enable these different participants to analyze the relevant end-to-end data in near real-time, with data stores from 10s to 100s of terabytes (TBs) and flexible configurations for IDM, foundry, fabless, and OSAT specific needs. Our ML solutions combine professional services with the Exensio platform to further enable our customers to push their analytics “to the edge” of their global supply chains and shift the analysis and decision-making processes closer to where their data is being generated. We believe enabling edge analytics will further increase our customers’ ability to improve product yield, quality, performance, and profitability, and therefore, should drive the market for our products and services.

● | Drive Tool-Level Software Installations to Create an Infrastructure of Connected Equipment and Enable Smart Factories. We believe that driving installation of our software products at the tool level will provide an infrastructure of connected equipment and help to enable smart factories. In July 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Advantest Corporation through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Advantest America, Inc., (which
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we collectively refer to as Advantest) that includes the development of cloud-based applications for Advantest tools that leverage our Exensio software analytics. We believe this will allow us to increase the network of tools connected with PDF software and provide Advantest tool customers with increased data management and analytics. In December 2020, we acquired Cimetrix Incorporated (or Cimetrix) and began providing software products based on open standards for equipment control and connectivity to equipment manufacturers and factories. We believe that in the smart manufacturing era, the industry will demand the increased equipment connectivity and control our products and solutions offer. Further, we believe that the benefits from integration between analytics on equipment, the factory, and in the cloud will provide synergies with our existing end-to-end analytics offerings.

● | Create Differentiated Data Sources for Better Analytics. Historically, companies have only used data that was generated from their manufacturing and test process to drive improvements. We offer unique IP (such as Characterization Vehicle® (CV®) test chips) that is not part of an IC’s functionality, but significantly improves the manufacturing process by improving yield learning and reducing time to market. Also, our Design-for-Inspection™ (DFI™) system provides on-chip instrumentation and measurement applications from 28 nanometer (nm) down to 7nm and smaller - designed to identify blockers that impact product yield and quality months earlier than any other hardware- or software-based methodology. We believe that in the More-than-Moore (MtM) era, the differentiated data we provide can play an important role in enabling our customers to bring new products to market faster and with higher quality and performance, and, ultimately, more profitability.

Brief History
PDF Solutions was incorporated in Pennsylvania in November 1992, and we reincorporated in California in November 1995. In July 2000, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in July 2001, we completed an initial public offering. Our shares of common stock are currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Market as PDFS. We do not have any multi-class voting stock or any non-voting stock.
From 2000 through 2009, we expanded our technology footprint and our operations in various countries through acquisitions. From 2009 to 2019, we primarily focused on the pervasive application of our technology to leading edge logic manufacturing and achieving yield targets with our clients that maximized Gainshare royalties. In 2013, we leveraged our extensive experience in yield simulation software and CV® test chip development and started research and development on an e-beam solution for non-contact, inline electrical characterization and process control for wafer inspection. The first-generation e-beam tool for DFI™ was completed in 2015, and the second generation was commercially deployed in 2019. In a parallel effort, starting in 2014, we re-architected our point-solution software tools into a new generation, highly-integrated data analytics Exensio platform, which resulted in accelerated growth in software through 2019. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Cimetrix and began providing software products based on open standards for equipment control and connectivity to equipment manufacturers and factories.
Industry Background
Rapid technological innovation with increasingly shorter product life cycles has fueled the economic growth of the semiconductor industry since the days of the PC revolution. IC companies have historically ramped production slowly, produced at high volume once a product gained market acceptance, and slowly reduced production volume when price and demand started to decrease near the end of the product’s life cycle. Today there are many different business models across the semiconductor industry: products that follow the traditional life cycle just described, products targeted towards fast-moving market segments like Internet of Things (or IoT) – which utilize mature process nodes and requires a fast ramp to volume with a relatively short life cycle –, and products focused on long term market segments like automotive and industrial where product life cycles can last a decade or longer. There is a lot of variation across these business models depending on the level of design complexity and the maturity of the process node used for product implementation. Processors, memory and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) continue to leverage the most advanced process nodes and experience significant challenges to achieve competitive initial yields and optimized performance. Some products and market segments, however, are content to utilize older process nodes. Regardless of the process node used for implementation or how long the product will be sold in the market, success for every semiconductor company is predicated, among other things, on fast product yield ramp and the ability to optimize manufacturing and test metrics, such as yield

reclamation, product quality, and test efficiency, throughout a product’s life cycle. Thus, technologies or capabilities that can accelerate yield ramp, improve product quality, and optimize production efficiencies are highly sought after because they typically lead to cost reduction and revenue generation concurrently, causing a leveraged effect on profitability.
Technology and Intellectual Property Protection
Our success is largely dependent upon our proprietary software. We believe the creative skills and technological ability of our personnel, product enhancements, and new product development are necessary to maintaining our position as a leading provider. We rely primarily on trade secret rights, copyright and trademark laws, and nondisclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our technology. We seek to protect our IP under patent laws and as of December 31, 2021, we held 185 U.S. patents. Our issued patents have expiration dates from 2022 through 2039. We intend to prepare additional patent applications when we feel it is beneficial. We also employ protection of our trademarks, with registration of marks, including Characterization Vehicle, Cimetrix, CV, eProbe, Exensio, pdFasTest, PDF Solutions, and the PDF Solutions and Cimetrix logos. We have common law rights to additional trademarks, including ALPS, DFI, DirectProbe, DirectScan, FIRE, and VarScan. We also enter into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and confidentiality and license agreements with our customers and the various parties we partner with to resell, distribute, and, in some cases, integrate our products. Further, we limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Third parties could in any case develop competing technologies that include similar functionality or features, or otherwise are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries where we operate. Our business could suffer significantly if we fail to protect our proprietary technology.
In addition, through yield, performance, and reliability improvement services over more than 20 years, we have accumulated a vast library of physical IP in the form of test structures. As part of our DFI and CV systems, our engineers create designs of experiments (or DOEs) and layouts for targeted fail modes. We have also developed electrical measurement hardware tools and proprietary extraction, design, and analysis software. In addition, our technology embodies many production-proven and patented algorithms. Further, our IP includes proven methodologies that our implementation teams use as guidelines to drive our customers’ use of our technology. We strive to continually enhance our core technologies through the codification of knowledge that we gain in the use of our products and delivery of services.

Cimetrix® Software Products. Our Cimetrix software products enable equipment manufacturers to provide industry standard interfaces on their products for efficient equipment communication, control, and collection of equipment data. There are numerous industry standards that have been established for equipment connectivity and control, including the SEMI defined SECS (SEMI Equipment Communication Standard), GEM (Generic Equipment Model), and PV2 (new photovoltaic equipment communication standard based on SECS/GEM) standards. By providing software products that fully support these industry standards, equipment manufacturers can implement robust, turnkey support for these connectivity and control standards without needing to invest engineering resources to develop their own interfaces to these standards. Factories that purchase manufacturing equipment enabled with Cimetrix-supported interfaces, benefit from consistent and robust implementations of industry standards, enabling faster and more efficient implementation of smart manufacturing initiatives that depend on the collection and analysis of manufacturing and product data. There are two separate Cimetrix product lines targeting the needs of factory equipment connectivity and control. The products are sold via perpetual licenses and runtime royalties.

● | Equipment Factory Connectivity – Our products for equipment connectivity primarily include the following:

Services
Our services are almost always sold together with, or to support, our products and include the following:
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) – We provide services to make our Exensio software available to our customers via the Internet, generally hosted by third-party providers. SaaS is considered part of cloud computing since the software is hosted on the Internet, or the “cloud.” Since our SaaS applications are accessed from a remote server rather than installed on individual machines, it is easier to maintain. For example, when the remote software is updated, the customer’s interface is also updated for all users. Cloud computing is designed to eliminate incompatibilities between different software versions and allow us to make incremental updates without requiring software downloads. Additionally, our customers can save data to a central online location, which is designed to allow increased project collaboration. As part of these services, we also typically provide hosted management services for the licensed software and the customer’s data stored in our cloud. These services include environment set-up and configuration, system health monitoring, data integration maintenance, integration monitoring, system updates, security, and data upload/download, and license administration.
Software Related Services – We provide software maintenance and support (or M&S), data management services, various value-added services (or VAS) to install, configure, or create analysis templates, and other professional services to achieve customers’ specific outcomes using our software. We call this last type of services our solutions offering and, in these cases, we tailor the use of one or more Exensio products to achieve a desired result. For example, our AIM YieldAware™ FDC solution offering is designed to identify the process control variables that have the greatest impact on product yield through professional services that analyze the data from both Exensio Process Control and elements of Exensio Manufacturing Analytics and make recommendations for the customer to implement. VAS are provided by our professional service personnel with expertise that enhances and complements the engineering teams at our customers. For example, VAS includes our data cleaning and monitoring services. One requirement of big data analytics is to have clean, 

9



harmonized data to analyze. This service offering outsources the data wrangling and management effort to free the customer to focus their efforts on analysis, which has a greater ROI to the company than data management.
Characterization Services – These services are designed to characterize key product and/or process elements, primarily into CV test structures or DFI on-chip measurement instruments, and typically do not include performance incentives based on the customers’ yield achievement. We provide these services, typically together with all of the elements of our CV system, to foundry customers in connection with new process technology development and/or yield ramp. In Characterization engagements, we generally provide the analysis of our CV test chips and provide summary findings and recommendations to the customer. Characterization engagements can include DFI systems.
Customers
Our existing customers include foundries, IDMs, fabless semiconductor design companies, OSATs, equipment manufacturers, EMS, and ODMs, including those that embed and distribute our Assembly Operations modules in their equipment. Our semiconductor customers’ targeted product segments vary significantly, including microprocessors, memory, graphics, image sensor solutions, and communications. We believe that the adoption of our solutions by such companies for usage in a wide range of products validates the application of our solutions to the broader semiconductor market. We often have multiple contracts with a single customer or customer group, with no interdependent performance obligations. In general, our customer contracts are non-cancellable.
Two customers accounted for 27% of our revenues for 2021, and one customer accounted for 23% of our revenues for 2020. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in 2021 and 2020. See the discussion in “Risk Factors” under Item 1A for more information about risks associated with customer concentration and contractual provisions.
International revenues accounted for approximately 55% and 58% of our total revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We base these calculations on the geographic location of where the work is performed or where the customer is located. Revenues from customers by geographic area based on the location of the customers’ work sites for our last two fiscal years can be found in Note 13, “Customer and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial statements. Additional discussion regarding the risks associated with international operations can be found under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
See our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”, included under Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional geographic information.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is primarily to pursue targeted accounts through a combination of our direct sales force, our service teams, and strategic alliances. After we are engaged by a customer and early in the services process, our engineers seek to establish relationships in the organization and gain an understanding of our customers’ business issues. Our direct sales and service teams combine their efforts to deepen our customer relationships by expanding our penetration across customers’ products, processes, and technologies. This close working relationship with each customer has the added benefit of helping us to identify new product areas and technologies in which we should next focus our research and development efforts. From time-to-time, we use sales representatives/agents in various locations to augment direct sales in certain territories. We expect to continue to establish strategic alliances with process licensors, vendors in the electronic design automation software, capital equipment for IC production, and test silicon IP and mask-making software segments to create and take advantage of sales channel and co-marketing opportunities. Additionally, we expect to form relationships with key value chain participants, including foundries and OSATs, to provide services and value across the manufacturing supply chain.
Research and Development
Our research and development focuses on developing and introducing new proprietary technologies, including our Exensio platform, Cimetrix connectivity and control products, and DFI and CV systems, as well as other software products 

10



and enhancements to our existing solutions, such as field applications for DFI and CV. We use a rapid-prototyping paradigm in the context of the customer engagement to achieve these goals. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development. The complexity of our technologies requires expertise in standards, physical IC design and layout, transistor design and semiconductor physics, semiconductor process integration, numerical algorithms, e-beam technology, hardware, statistics and software development. We believe that our team of engineers will continue to advance our market and technological leadership. We conduct in-house training for our engineers in certain technical areas. Our training also extends to focusing on ways to enhance client service skills. Although it fluctuates, we can have up to one quarter of our research and development engineers operating in the field, partnered with solution services engineers, in a deliberate strategy to provide direct feedback between technology development and customer needs. We also utilize a variety of skilled independent contractors for specialized development.
Competition
The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing prices. We expect market competition to continue to develop and increase as the market for data and analytics continues to evolve. We believe IC companies benefit from a combination of big data management infrastructure, AI/ML-based analytics engines, and products that generate and collect differentiated data that enrich the analytics process. Currently, we are a leading provider of comprehensive commercial hardware, software and IP solutions for optimizing and improving design, manufacturing and test operations processes through the application of differentiated data and advanced analytics. We face indirect competition from internal groups at IC companies that offer tools with varying degrees of optimization to accelerate process-design integration or test operations. Some providers of semiconductor manufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their product offerings and compete with us. In each of the market segments we compete in, we face competition from established and potential competitors, some of whom may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have.
We currently face indirect competition from the internal groups at IC companies and direct competition from providers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA-Tencor, Siemens AG (or Siemens), Onto Innovation, Inc. (or Onto), and Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”); (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Synopsys, Invantest, Inc., NI, Inc., Onto, and Siemens; (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as Applied Materials and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity software or integration products/services supporting factory equipment connectivity or control needs of customers, such as PEER Group, Inc., Kontron AIS, GmbH, Yokogawa Electric Corp., and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There may be other providers of competitive commercial solutions of which we are not aware, and we may compete with the products or offerings of these named companies or additional companies if we expand our offerings through acquisition or development. For example, through our acquisition of Cimetrix in late 2020, we now face competition in the connectivity and integration products/services supporting factory equipment connectivity or control. The demand for solutions that address the need for better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competitors to enter into our market. For example, in 2020, two of our competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys, Inc. acquired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, which may enable greater investment or marketing of these competitive applications. This competition in our market may intensify in the future, which could lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting our revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose to develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet market needs. These and other competitors may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than our engineering organization, which would give any such competitor’s products a competitive advantage over our solutions.
We believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to competition because we have demonstrated results and reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innovative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new technology and product generations. See the discussions in “Risk Factors” under Item 1A for more information about risks associated with our competition.

Information Security and Risk Oversight
We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to provide our products and services to our customers. As a result, we have developed an information security program (referred to as our InfoSec Program) to enhance our network security measures, identify and mitigate information security risk, and protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of critical information owned by us and that of our customers and suppliers that is in our care. Our InfoSec Program includes development, implementation, and continual improvement of policies and procedures to safeguard information and ensure availability of critical data and systems. The program also includes annual information security awareness training for employees involved in our systems and processes that handle customer data and audits of our systems and enhanced training for specialized personnel and we have instituted regular phishing email simulations for all employees and all contractors with access to corporate email systems to enhance awareness and responsiveness to such possible threats Our InfoSec Program further includes review and assessment by external, independent third-parties, who certify and report on our weaknesses and internal response preparedness with respect to the entire company. Accordingly, we have instituted periodic network access penetration (or PEN) testing no less than once per year both for our corporate network resources and our SaaS cloud-based offerings. In May 2021, we successfully completed our Type II System and Organization Control (SOC 2) audit of our cloud-based offerings under the framework put forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in which independent, third-party auditors assess and test controls relating to the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) of Security, Availability, and Confidentiality and no qualified findings were found during the audit period. In February 2022, we started our next Type II SOC 2 audit with external auditors and started the audit process leading to ISO 27001 certification. To date, we have not managed ITAR-designated data, technology, or information. In accordance with our InfoSec Program, we also actively monitor known threats that could affect our products and services and work with our suppliers to provide us with real-time reports of threats or vulnerabilities that may affect our enterprise-wide systems. Our InfoSec Program also includes a data security incident response plan that provides controls and procedures for timely and accurate reporting of any material cybersecurity incident.
As described in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is tasked with oversight of certain risk issues, including cybersecurity. This Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors, two of whom have significant work experience related to information security issues or oversight. Management reports security instances to the Committee as they occur, if material, and provides a summary multiple times per year to the Committee as well as the full Board about periodic assessment of our InfoSec Program, our internal response preparedness, and assessments led by outside advisors. We carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences, including penalties and settlements, of which there were none, were immaterial.
Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Initiatives
We have assembled a cross-functional team of leaders representing operations, human resources, supply chain, regulatory compliance, finance, marketing communications, investor relations, facilities, and the legal department with a focus on ESG issues relevant to the Company or that we can impact as a Company. In 2021, we formalized our corporate values as follows:
​

Integrity: | Team 
● | Uphold the Highest Ethical Standards in everything we do | ● | Treat Everyone with Respect 
● | Keep Our Commitments | ● | Encourage Open and Vibrant Communications
● | Safeguard Company IP | ● | Promote Creative Solutions 
​ | ​ | ● | Move Forward Together 

​
​

12




Growth: | Customers 
● | Embrace Change and Drive Innovation | ● | Provide Passionate Dedication to Customer Success
● | Pursue Long-term Profitable Growth | ● | Deliver the Highest Quality Products and Support 
● | Take Responsibility for Personal Growth | ● | Fiercely Protect Customer IP 

​
Although we are not a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (or RBA) (formerly, the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition or EICC), in 2021 in an effort to further our ESG efforts, we adopted the RBA Code of Conduct to supplement our Code of Ethics, including the specific policies of the RBA Code relating to the five critical areas of corporate social responsibility: labor, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. Guided by our above values and the following initial priorities, we believe we can achieve our business objectives and long-term stockholder value while doing our part in each of these areas. For additional information, see “Human Capital Management” in this Report below.
Care for Our People

● | We believe in upholding the principle of human rights, worker safety, and observing fair labor practices within our organization and our supply chain.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We embrace diverse viewpoints and perspectives, recognizing that greater inclusion fosters innovation and achieves better decision making and financial results. We have and plan to continue to undertake actions around organizational training, formalized company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of our employees, such as developing, implementing, and continuously improving health and safety systems and conditions, and providing appropriate preparation, education, reporting, and controls. For example, we have Illness Prevention and Hazard Communication programs and an Emergency Action Plan for worker safety at our clean room facility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Responsibility

● | We are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community by complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. For example, in 2020, we began the process of ISO14001 certification of our clean room facility, which specifies the requirements for the formulation and maintenance of an environmental management systems (EMS) and a specific framework for implementing relevant sustainable practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We ask our employees to help us accomplish this by looking for opportunities to conserve energy, reduce consumption of natural resources, preserve air, soil, and water quality, manage waste properly, and reuse and recycle, and reduce the use of toxic substances in our operations where possible, including, in particular, in our clean room and lab facilities. Our clean room facility does not produce any off gas or emissions and the only reportable, hazardous material that we use at that facility is liquid nitrogen, which is in a tank external to our building and monitored using telematics by an independent third party specializing in such activity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We look for ways to reduce energy consumption in our facilities around the world, including upgrades and or retrofits to LED and/or motion detector lighting and smart HVAC system.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethics & Corporate Responsibility

● | We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance, promoting business ethics and integrity, and embracing diversity, and inclusion in the board room and throughout the organization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




● | We are committed to observing fair, transparent, and accountable operating practices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We seek to create and foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we promote a positive work-life balance and ethical organizational culture and encourage all employees, regardless of position or level, to raise questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues and company policies and to offer suggestions about how we can make our organization better to address concerns.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have a Whistleblower Ethics Hotline that includes global telephone and web access together with local language support. The web portal enables online reporting of concerns, where allowed by local law, and a place to ask questions or quickly access ethics and compliance policies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe these efforts strengthen our ethics and compliance efforts and foster an environment where employees can express concerns and have them resolved.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In our view, the goals of providing value to stockholders and upholding the principle of human rights and treating people fairly and with dignity are integrally interconnected. We are committed to promoting equality and supporting racial justice in the communities where we do business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply Chain Responsibility

● | We request that our suppliers adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct or its equivalent by flowing this requirement through our commercial contracts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We also support Rule 13p-1 under the Exchange Act (known as the Conflict Minerals Law) and efforts to avoid sourcing conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (or DRC) and in adjoining countries. Consistent with the Conflict Minerals Law and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance concerning conflict minerals, we adopted the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative Due Diligence reporting process and seek to obtain conflict minerals content declarations from our suppliers each year, all in an effort to promote supply chain transparency. We do not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (collectively referred to as 3TG) from mines, smelters or refiners, and we are in most cases several or more levels removed from these supply chain participants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We therefore expect:
--+---------------------


o | our suppliers to source 3TG only from smelters and refiners validated as being conflict free and that do not directly or indirectly benefit or finance armed groups in the DRC or other covered country;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | our suppliers to fully-comply with the Conflict Minerals Law and provide all necessary declarations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | our suppliers to pass these requirements through to their supply chain and determine the source and chain of custody of specified minerals, including 3TG; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | any suppliers not willing to comply with these requirements to be reviewed by global procurement with regard to future business and sourcing declarations. This conflict minerals policy encourages our suppliers to respect and protect human rights throughout the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Capital Management
We believe we have a responsibility to foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization through sound ethical and organizational governance, by promoting business ethics and integrity, and by embracing equality, diversity, and inclusion throughout our organization and even extending to the board room.

additional information, see “Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Initiatives—Ethics & Corporate Responsibility,” in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.
We established a cross-functional advisory team of company leaders at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that promoting the health and safety of our employees in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines remains a constant focal point. Work in our offices and travel policies are in compliance with local, state, and national requirements. For employees working remotely, we encouraged them to tell us what home office equipment and IT support they needed to set up a home office for healthy and productive work. For a small number of employees on-site at our clean room facility, we set up strict COVID safety protocols. To stay connected while working remotely, beginning in April 2020, our Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive team have led virtual meetings twice a month with the various sales, research and development, engineering, and administrative teams to discuss developments and business updates and answer questions. Safety protocols, such as attendance capacity, temperature checking requirements, 6-feet distancing, managed traffic flows, providing and requiring appropriate masks to be worn while in the office, eliminating/spacing out eating in common areas, limiting attendance in conference rooms, accessible hand sanitation stations throughout the office, and visitor prescreening have been put in place in worldwide offices as advised by the CDC and required by local regulations when local regulations have allowed employees to be in the office.
We support employee action to protect the natural environment and the communities in which we operate through pollution prevention, conservation, responsible use, charitable giving, and sustainable practices. For example, we organize and engage employees in an annual charitable giving campaign. We work to ensure that our business practices support diversity and inclusion to build an innovative workforce and to strive toward having our organization reflect the complexion of our customers and suppliers. We are strengthening our diversity and inclusion programs with actions around organizational training, formalized company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 407 employees worldwide, including 178 field application engineers and consultants, 130 in research and development, 50 in sales and marketing, and 49 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 218 are located in the United States and Canada, 157 in Asia, and 32 in Europe.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in France and Italy are subject to collective bargaining agreements in those countries. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in our industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, sales, and technical employees.
