Item 1. Business
Background and Overview
 
Lucid Diagnostics, Inc. (“Lucid”) is a commercial-stage medical diagnostics technology company focused on the millions of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD”), also known as chronic heartburn, acid reflux or simply reflux, who are at risk of developing esophageal precancer and cancer, specifically highly lethal esophageal adenocarcinoma (“EAC”). References in this Form 10-K to “we,” “us” and “our” are to Lucid and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries.
 
We believe that our lead products, the EsoGuard® Esophageal DNA Test performed on samples collected with the EsoCheck® Esophageal Cell Collection Device, constitute the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent EAC deaths, through early detection of esophageal precancer in at-risk GERD patients. The technologies were highlighted in the NCI’s Annual Plan and Budget Proposal for FY2020 to Congress as one of the year’s significant advances in cancer prevention. We believe EsoGuard could have as great an impact in preventing EAC deaths as widespread Pap test screening has had in preventing cervical cancer deaths.
 
Lucid was formed in May 2018 as a subsidiary of our parent company, PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq: PAVM) (“PAVmed”), to license the technologies underlying EsoGuard and EsoCheck from Case Western Reserve University (“CWRU”). For a description of the license agreement with CWRU, as amended to date (the “License Agreement”), please refer to “Business—License Agreement.” Since our inception we have been managed pursuant to a management services agreement with PAVmed and have financed our operations through working capital advances from PAVmed. For a description of the PAVmed management services agreement and financing of our operations, please refer to “Certain Transactions—Related Party Transactions.”
 
On October 14, 2021, Lucid completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its common stock under an effective registration statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-259721), wherein a total of 5.0 million IPO shares of common stock of Lucid Diagnostics Inc. were issued, with such total IPO shares inclusive of 571,428 shares issued to PAVmed , at an IPO offering price of $14.00 per share, resulting gross proceeds of $70.0 million, before underwriting fees of $4.9 million, and approximately $0.7 million of offering costs incurred by Lucid.
 
In just over three years since our inception, we have advanced the technologies underlying EsoGuard and EsoCheck from the academic research laboratory to commercial products within scalable business model. EsoGuard is commercialized in the U.S. as a Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”) and was granted final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021. EsoCheck is commercialized in the U.S. as a 510(k)-cleared esophageal cell collection device. EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, was granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Breakthrough Device designation and is the subject of two large, actively enrolling, international multicenter PMA clinical trials.
 
The proceeds of the IPO offering and transitioning to a public company was aimed at driving a growth strategy focused on expanding commercialization across multiple channels, including expanding the number of our own testing centers, and expanding the clinical evidence of our products’ efficacy to support our ongoing regulatory, reimbursement and commercial efforts, as well as recommendation of our products in clinical practice guidelines.
 
The EsoCheck device received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA, in June 2019 and European CE Mark Certification in May 2021 as an esophageal cell collection device. EsoGuard has been established as a Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”), completed European CE Mark Certification in June 2021, and was launched commercially in December 2019 after Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (“CLIA”) certification and College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) accreditation of the test at Lucid Diagnostics commercial diagnostic laboratory partner ResearchDx Inc. (“RDx”), headquartered in Irvine, California. In August 2021, Lucid Diagnostics launched a strategic partnership with direct-to-consumer telemedicine company UpScriptHealth to support our commercialization efforts. Also in August 2021, we tested our first patients referred by primary care physicians (“PCPs”) in three Lucid Test Centers opened in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

Subsequently, on February 25, 2022, our new, wholly owned subsidiary, LucidDx Labs Inc. (“LucidDx Labs”), acquired from RDx, certain licenses and other related assets necessary for LucidDx Labs to operate its own new CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical laboratory located in Lake Forest, CA. Since March 2022, we have conducted EsoGuard testing at our owned laboratory.
 
EsoGuard, and EsoCheck and EsoCure
 
EsoGuard and EsoCheck are based on patented technology licensed from CWRU. and have been developed to provide an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test for the early detection of EAC and Barrett’s Esophagus (“BE”), including dysplastic BE and related pre-cursors to EAC in patients with chronic GERD.
 
EsoGuard is a bisulfite-converted next-generation sequencing (“NGS”) DNA assay performed on surface esophageal cells collected with EsoCheck. It quantifies methylation at 31 sites on two genes, Vimentin (VIM) and Cyclin A1 (CCNA1). The assay was evaluated in a 408-patient multicenter case-control study published in Science Translational Medicine and showed greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity at detecting esophageal precancer and all conditions along the BE-EAC spectrum, including on samples collected with EsoCheck (Moinova, et al. Sci Transl Med. 2018 Jan 17;10(424): eaao5848). EsoGuard is commercially available in the U.S. as a LDT performed at our CLIA-certified and CAP-certified laboratory partner, RDx, which does business as “PacificDx.” Cell samples, including those collected with EsoCheck, as discussed below, are sent to RDx, for testing and analyses using our proprietary EsoGuard NGS DNA assay.


EsoCheck is an FDA 510(k) and CE Mark cleared noninvasive swallowable balloon capsule catheter device capable of sampling surface esophageal cells in a less than five-minute office. It consists of a vitamin pill-sized rigid plastic capsule tethered to a thin silicone catheter from which a soft silicone balloon with textured ridges emerges to gently swab surface esophageal cells. When vacuum suction is applied, the balloon and sampled cells are pulled into the capsule, protecting them from contamination and dilution by cells outside of the targeted region during device withdrawal. We believe this proprietary Collect+Protect™ technology makes EsoCheck the only noninvasive esophageal cell collection device capable of such anatomically targeted and protected sampling.
 
In December 2019, we secured “gapfill” determination for the EsoGuard PLA code 0114U through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) process, which has allowed us to engage directly with Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA, LLC and its MolDx Program on CMS payment and coverage. In October 2020, CMS granted EsoGuard final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021. We are still awaiting Medicare local coverage determination from MolDx, which we understand is working to clear a significant backlog of reviews.
 
We are also aggressively pursuing EsoGuard U.S. private payor payment and coverage. We held advisory board meetings with medical directors of major insurers to obtain feedback and guidance on the type of clinical data that will be helpful in securing payment and coverage. Although the claim cycle can be prolonged during the early commercialization of a new test, RDx is starting to receive out-of-network private insurance payments on our behalf.
 
Our initial EsoGuard commercialization efforts focused on gastroenterology (“GI”) physicians who have generally embraced our message that EsoGuard has the potential to expand the funnel of BE-EAC patients who will need long term EGD surveillance and, potentially, treatment with endoscopic esophageal ablation. We have previously relied upon a hybrid sales model with full-time sales management and approximately fifty independent sales representatives. We significantly expanded our full-time commercial team in 2021 and are actively recruiting full-time territory managers and sales representatives nationwide. Our Lucid Vice President of Sales and three Area Sales Directors (“ASD”) oversee a growing number of Sales Representatives, Market Development Mangers (“MDM”) and Clinical Specialists. EsoGuard testing has accelerated as pandemic-related healthcare facility limitations have eased.


Our EsoGuard commercialization efforts span multiple channels including targeting primary care physicians and consumers in addition to GI physicians. To assure sufficient testing capacity and geographic coverage, as part of this expansion, we are building our own network of Lucid Test Centers, staffed by Lucid-employed clinical personnel, where patients can undergo the EsoCheck procedure and have the sample sent for EsoGuard testing, starting with three test centers launched in the Phoenix metropolitan area. We have expanded our test centers to include Salt Lake City, Utah, Henderson, Nevada, and Denver, Colorado. We are currently expanding into Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and Boise, Idaho.

We have also established an EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, in partnership with UpScript, LLC, an independent third-party telemedicine provider, that accommodates EsoGuard self-referrals from direct-to-consumer marketing.
 
Our active clinical research and development program seeks to expand the clinical evidence of our products’ efficacy to support our ongoing regulatory, reimbursement and commercial efforts, including an FDA PMA submission for approval of EsoGuard and EsoCheck used together as an in vitro device (“IVD”), as currently, EsoGuard and EsoCheck are permitted to be marketed separately, but not in combination. We are actively enrolling patients in two international multicenter clinical trials to support FDA PMA approval of EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, as an IVD indicated to detect NDBE. ESOGUARD-BE-1 is a screening study which will enroll approximately 500 to 900 male GERD patients over 50 years of age with one other risk factor. ESOGUARD-BE-2 is a case control study which will enroll approximately 500 male GERD patients with a previous diagnosis of NDBE, LGD, HGD, or EAC, along with normal controls.
 
In February 2020, we received FDA “Breakthrough Device Designation” for EsoGuard as an in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) medical device. The FDA Breakthrough Device Program was created to offer patients more timely access to breakthrough technologies which provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions by expediting their development, assessment and review through enhanced communications and more efficient and flexible clinical study design, including more favorable pre/post market data collection balance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the United States Congress continue to work to provide an expedited coverage pathway for emerging technologies.


We have received ISO 13485:2016 certification for Lucid’s quality management system and received CE Mark certification for EsoCheck in May 2021 which allows it to be marketed in CE Mark European countries, which include the European Economic Area (the EU, Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein), Switzerland, and, until July 1, 2023, the United Kingdom. In June 2021, we completed the European Directive 98/79/EC for In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (“IVDD”) CE Mark certification for EsoGuard after Lucid and its European Union (“EU”) authorized representative completed the Commission of the European Union (“EC”) declaration of conformity procedure, including the associated technical documentation, ensuring and declaring EsoGuard meets the essential requirements of the IVDD.
 
EsoCure
 
EsoCure is in development as an Esophageal Ablation Device, with the intent to allow a clinician to treat dysplastic BE before it can progress to EAC, a highly lethal esophageal cancer, and to do so without the need for complex and expensive capital equipment. We have successfully completed a pre-clinical feasibility animal study of EsoCure demonstrating excellent, controlled circumferential ablation of the esophageal mucosal lining. We have also completed an acute and survival animal study of EsoCure™ Esophageal Ablation Device, demonstrating successful direct thermal balloon catheter ablation of esophageal lining through the working channel of a standard endoscope. We plan to conduct additional development work and animal testing of EsoCure to support a future FDA 510(k) submission.
 
In March 2022, both the PAVmed and Lucid board of directors approved entering into an intercompany license between PAVmed and Lucid such that Lucid will be granted the rights to commercialize EsoCure for the treating dysplastic Barrett’s Esophagus. Under the intercompany license, Lucid will pay PAVmed a 5% royalty on all EsoCure sales up to $100 million per calendar year, and 8% above that threshold. Lucid will be obligated to fund ongoing development costs and cumulative patent expenses. EsoCure will become part of an integrated suite of Lucid products addressing BE-EAC. Furthermore, should PAVmed acquire businesses or commercial products or develop technologies that may be partially or wholly synergistic with Lucid’s lead products and therefore provide the opportunity to create value, Lucid may also seek to negotiate an arms-length commercial license from PAVmed to market the relevant commercial products that may originate from PAVmed’s development or acquisition initiatives. To that end, In March 2022, both the PAVmed and Lucid board of directors have approved entering into an intercompany purchase and sale of the CapNostics, LLC assets from PAVmed to Lucid as well as transferring the consulting agreement with the previous principal owner of CapNostics, LLC. The transfer price is $2.1 million for the assets, the same purchase price paid by PAVmed’s subsidiary.

Diagnostics – Opportunity, Solution, and Strategy
 
GERD, a pathologic condition in which stomach fluid, including acid, inappropriately refluxes into the lower esophagus, is ubiquitous and can lead to highly lethal EAC. Our opportunity is to prevent EAC deaths through the early detection of esophageal precancer and cancer in millions of at-risk GERD patients.
 
In 2021, approximately 20,000 U.S. GERD patients are projected to be diagnosed with EAC and approximately 16,000 will die from it. Over 80% of EAC patients will die within five years of diagnosis, making it the second most lethal cancer in the U.S. The U.S. incidence of EAC has increased 500% over the past four decades, while the incidences of other common cancers have declined or remained flat. In nearly all cases, EAC silently progresses until it manifests itself with new symptoms of advanced disease. EAC is nearly always invasive at diagnosis, and, unlike other common cancers, mortality rates are high even in its earlier stages.
 
Up to 50 million, or one in four, U.S. adults have weekly GERD symptoms. Although symptoms can be ameliorated with medications, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as Nexium® and Prilosec®, medications do not prevent progression to esophageal precancer or cancer.
 
BE is an esophageal precancer and complication of GERD characterized by pathologic transformation of surface esophageal cells. Dysplastic BE is a late esophageal precancer characterized by further premalignant pathologic transformation called dysplasia. All EAC is believed to arise from BE as the culmination of pathologic changes along the BE-EAC precancer-cancer spectrum—from nondysplastic BE (“NDBE”), to low-grade dysplastic BE (“LGD”), high-grade dysplastic BE (“HGD”) and finally EAC. Dysplastic BE can be cured with endoscopic esophageal ablation which reliably halts progression to EAC.


The subgroup of long-standing or severe GERD patients at-risk for BE and progression to EAC is well defined in clinical practice guidelines, including the American College of Gastroenterology (“ACG”) BE Guidelines. Risk factors include age over 50 years, male gender, White race, obesity, smoking history and a family history of BE-EAC. The ACG BE Guidelines recommend screening for patients with a five-year history of, or severe, GERD and three or more risk factors. The highest risk symptomatic GERD cohort recommended for screening consists of the estimated 13 million U.S. men over 50 with one additional risk factor. An estimated 60% of at-risk GERD patients are Medicare beneficiaries.


Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, less than 10% of at-risk GERD patients who are recommended for screening undergo traditional invasive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (“EGD”). We believe that the profound tragedy of an EAC diagnosis is that likely death could have been prevented if the at-risk GERD patient had been screened and then undergone surveillance and curative endoscopic esophageal ablation of dysplastic BE.


Since mortality rates are high even in early stage EAC, preventing EAC deaths requires detection and intervention at the precancer stage. Most of the necessary elements for such an early detection program are already well established—an at-risk population (at-risk GERD patients), a precancer (BE), and an intervention which can halt progression to EAC (endoscopic esophageal ablation). The only missing element for such an early detection program is a widespread screening tool that can detect BE prior to EAC.
 
We believe EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, constitutes that missing element—the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent EAC deaths through early detection of esophageal precancer and cancer in at-risk GERD patients.

Current Status of EsoGuard and EsoCheck
 
Regulatory
 
In June 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market EsoCheck in the U.S. as a device indicated for use in the collection and retrieval of surface cells of the esophagus in adults. In December 2019, Research Dx Inc. (“RDx”), our CLIA-certified commercial clinical laboratory services partner, completed documentation of EsoGuard analytical validity allowing us to commercialize it as an LDT. In March 2022, we transferred testing to our own laboratory, upon our acquisition of certain assets from RDx as described elsewhere in this report. In May 2021, we received CE Mark certification for EsoCheck, and in June 2021, we completed CE Mark self-certification for EsoGuard, indicating both may be marketed in CE Mark European countries.
 
EsoGuard’s status as a commercially available LDT is dependent on the FDA exercising enforcement discretion for LDTs. Notwithstanding the fact that FDA has exercised such discretion despite indicating through non-binding communications and documents it might consider no longer doing so, and the fact that HHS recently forbade FDA from requiring premarket review of LDTs absent a formal rulemaking process, pending legislation seeking to revamp the regulatory framework of diagnostic tests keeps the regulatory landscape for LDTs such as EsoGuard uncertain. To mitigate that risk long-term, and to allow the marketing of EsoGuard and EsoCheck together, we have decided to pursue FDA PMA approval for EsoGuard, as an IVD device. In October 2019, we participated in an FDA pre-submission meeting and received feedback on a proposed initial indication for use and the design of our two international multi-center clinical studies to support a PMA application for FDA approval of EsoGuard on samples collected with EsoCheck. We expect to complete enrollment by the end of 2022 and submit our PMA by early 2023.
 
Manufacturing & Logistics
 
EsoCheck is currently manufactured for us by our partner Sage Product Development Inc. on a line that can produce over ten thousand units per year. In July 2021 we entered into an agreement to transfer the EsoCheck manufacturing line to high-volume manufacturer Coastline International Inc. The initial term of the agreement expires on September 1, 2023, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year terms unless either party notifies the other of intent to terminate the agreement no less than 90 days prior to the initial termination date or the expiration of any successive term. The agreement, as amended, provides per unit pricing for up to 250,000 units per year, a non-recurring charge to cover the costs associated with the transfer process, and a detailed timeline that allows for the flexibility to move production to Coastline later in 2022 as test volumes increase. The manufacturing line is being designed to allow capacity to be scaled to over one million units per year. Our EsoGuard Specimen Kits are manufactured for us by our partner RDx and can be transferred to a higher volume manufacturer whenever demand dictates. The warehousing, logistics, fulfillment and customer support of our products is managed for us by our partner HealthLink International, a leading third-party logistics company.
Reimbursement
 
In December 2019, we secured “gapfill” determination for EsoGuard’s PLA code 0114U through the CMS CLFS process. This allowed us to engage directly with Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA and its MolDx Program on CMS payment and coverage. In October 2020, CMS granted EsoGuard final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021. We are still awaiting Medicare local coverage determination from MolDx, which we understand is working to clear a significant backlog of reviews.
 
We are also aggressively pursuing EsoGuard U.S. private payor payment and coverage. We held advisory board meetings with medical directors of major insurers to obtain feedback and guidance on the type of clinical data that will be helpful in securing payment and coverage. Although the claim cycle can be prolonged during the early commercialization of a new test, RDx has received out-of-network private insurance payments for submitted EsoGuard tests.
 
Commercialization
 
Our initial EsoGuard commercialization efforts on gastroenterology (“GI”) physicians who have generally embraced our message that EsoGuard has the potential to expand the funnel of BE-EAC patients who will need long-term EGD surveillance and, potentially, treatment with endoscopic esophageal ablation. At the outset of our commercialization, we utilized a hybrid sales model with full-time sales management but have since transitioned and significantly expanded our full-time commercial team in 2021 and are actively recruiting full-time territory market develop managers and sales representatives nationwide. EsoGuard testing has begun accelerating as pandemic-related healthcare facility limitations have eased.

-


We are now expanding EsoGuard commercialization to target primary care physicians. The vast majority of at-risk GERD patients are cared for by PCPs and never see a gastroenterologist. To assure sufficient testing capacity and geographic coverage during this expansion, we are building our own network of Lucid Test Centers, where Lucid-employed clinical personnel will perform the EsoCheck procedure for EsoGuard testing. We have hired personnel and leased medical office space and have launched three pilot Lucid Test Centers in the Phoenix metropolitan area and added centers in Utah, Colorado, and Nevada. We are presently focused on adding Centers in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Additionally, we have established an EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, in partnership with an independent third-party telemedicine provider, that can accommodate EsoGuard self-referrals from direct-to-consumer marketing. In July 2021, we entered into an agreement with UpScript, LLC (“UpScript”) to develop and operate a web-based platform to allow individuals access to licensed physicians and healthcare professionals in order to engage in a telemedicine consult. UpScript will develop, operate, and maintain a Lucid website for individuals to request a Laboratory Test and access physicians and other healthcare professionals that are each qualified by law for professional services they are providing. The Lucid website will have the ability to transmit the requests from individuals and return a test order, if authorized. UpScript will transmit any such test order to the CLIA-certified laboratory directed by Lucid in order arrange for the performance of the specimen collection with the EsoCheck and performance of the laboratory test (EsoGuard).
 
Clinical Research & Development
 
Our active clinical research and development program seeks to expand the clinical evidence of our products’ efficacy to support our ongoing regulatory, reimbursement and commercial efforts. We are actively enrolling patients in two international multicenter clinical trials to support FDA PMA approval of EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, as an IVD device indicated to detect NDBE. ESOGUARD-BE-1 is a screening study which will enroll approximately 500 to 900 male GERD patients over 50 years of age with one other risk factor. ESOGUARD-BE-2 is a case control study which will enroll approximately 500 male GERD patients with a previous diagnosis of NDBE, LGD, HGD, or EAC, along with normal controls. Approximately one-half of the U.S. sites and one European site are actively enrolling. We expect to complete enrollment in both trials by the end of 2022 or the early part of 2023 and submit our PMA to FDA by mid-2023.
Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe EsoGuard’s total addressable U.S. market opportunity exceeds $25 billion based on an effective Medicare payment of $1,938 and the over 13 million U.S. male at-risk GERD patients recommended for screening by clinical practice guidelines. We believe that EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, as the first and only commercially available test capable of serving as a widespread BE-EAC screening tool, has the potential to become the standard of care to detect esophageal precancer in at-risk GERD patients.
Expand EsoGuard Commercialization Across Multiple Channels
 
The first pillar of our overall growth strategy is to expand EsoGuard commercialization across multiple channels, targeting primary care physicians (PCPs) and consumers in addition to GI physicians. We continue to accelerate the expansion of our sales and marketing team targeting these multiple channels.
 
We have the opportunity to educate PCPs that GERD can lead to EAC, and that, for the first time, they can refer their at-risk GERD patients for testing using a non-endoscopic alternative to EGD. We believe our Lucid Test Centers will play a critical role in significantly growing EsoGuard testing from PCP referrals. After advancing the pilot program in Phoenix, we are steadily expanding our Lucid Test Centers to other metropolitan areas, first in Western U.S. states and then nationwide.
 
We believe that direct-to-consumer (DTC) education and marketing will help drive our long-term growth. We believe that educating consumers on the link between GERD and BE-EAC, and the availability of a simple noninvasive test to detect esophageal precancer, will encourage those at risk to consider EsoGuard testing. We have launched an EsoGuard Telemedicine Program with DTC marketing in Phoenix and will expand it to other metropolitan areas once we demonstrate an acceptable return on investment.

Expand Our Clinical Evidence to Support Commercialization, Reimbursement and Regulatory Efforts
 
The second pillar of our growth strategy is to aggressively expand the clinical evidence for our products to support our commercialization, reimbursement and regulatory efforts, as well as to secure recommendations in clinical practice guidelines, an important value creation milestone. We are currently undertaking multiple ongoing and future clinical trials to build this evidence.
 
We seek to accelerate completion of our ongoing ESOGUARD-BE-1 and ESOGUARD-BE-2 clinical trials to support FDA PMA approval of EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, as an IVD device. We will then work with FDA, pursuant to our Breakthrough Device designation, to extend the ESOGUARD-BE-1 to enroll sufficient patients to support an expanded indication to detect dysplastic BE, a substantial but potentially highly rewarding undertaking. Finally, we are planning several EsoGuard/EsoCheck clinical utility studies, including a large registry and a study using electronic medical record screening to assess an EsoGuard-driven strategy to find BE-EAC disease in at-risk GERD patients.
 
Expand Our Manufacturing and Laboratory Testing Capacity
 
We are in the process of scaling our operational capacity, enhance efficiency and improve operating margins as demand for our products grows. We will complete transfer of EsoCheck manufacturing to a high-volume partner in 2022, which will provide sufficient long-term manufacturing capacity and substantially lower per-unit cost of goods. We anticipate doing the same for EsoGuard Specimen Kit manufacturing as demand dictates. We previously relied on the CLIA-certified commercial clinical laboratory at RDx to meet EsoGuard testing needs. However, we believed it was in our long-term interest to secure our own CLIA-certified laboratory, to increase capacity further, streamline billing and claims management, and decrease per-test cost of goods. In that regard, on February 25, 2022, our new, wholly owned subsidiary, LucidDx Labs, acquired from RDx certain licenses and other related assets necessary for LucidDx Labs to operate its own new CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical laboratory located in Lake Forest, CA. Since March 2022, we have conducted EsoGuard testing at our owned laboratory.
Expand Our Product Portfolio
 
We seek to expand our product portfolio with at least two highly synergistic technologies under development—BE-EAC progression markers and PAVmed’s EsoCure device—that would create a fully integrated suite of products to address the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of BE-EAC. We have the opportunity to license and develop biomarkers with the potential to discriminate between NDBE and dysplastic BE on samples collected with EsoCheck, which we believe would revolutionize NDBE surveillance. When dysplastic BE is identified, endoscopic esophageal ablation is indicated to cure the BE and halt progression to EAC. EsoCure has certain key features which give it the potential, once cleared and clinically available, to unseat the dominant RF ablation technology. We intend to pursue these and any other technologies which synergize with our lead products, improve our competitive position or otherwise provide the opportunity to create value. Subsequently, in March of 2022, both the PAVmed and Lucid boards approved entering into an intercompany license agreement for Lucid to formally license EsoCure.
 
Longer-Term Strategy
 
Our longer-term strategy is to secure a specific indication, based on published guidelines, for BE screening in certain at-risk populations using EsoGuard on samples collected with EsoCheck. This use of EsoGuard together with EsoCheck as a screening system must be cleared or approved by the FDA as an IVD, device. In September 2019, we entered into an agreement with a clinical research organization to assist us with two ongoing clinical trials for EsoGuard as an IVD device, which are actively enrolling patients and consist of a screening study (ESOGUARD-BE-1) and a case control study (ESOGUARD-BE-2).


The screening study is enrolling GERD patients without a prior diagnosis of BE or EAC who satisfy ACG BE screening guidelines. The case control study is enrolling patients with a previous diagnosis of non-dysplastic BE, dysplastic BE (both low and high-grade) or EAC. In both studies, EsoGuard is comparing to the gold standard of endoscopy with biopsies. In February 2020, EsoGuard has received Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA for its EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test on esophageal samples collected using its EsoCheck Cell Collection Device in a prevalent well-defined group of patients at elevated risk for esophageal dysplasia due to chronic GERD.

FDA Breakthrough Device
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration “Breakthrough Device” designation relates to the FDA’s Breakthrough Device Program that was created to offer patients more timely access to breakthrough technologies which provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions by expediting their development, assessment and review through enhanced communications and more efficient and flexible clinical study design, including more favorable pre- and post-market data collection. Breakthrough Devices receive priority FDA review, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the United States Congress continue to work to provide an expedited coverage pathway for emerging technologies. 
 
Pursuant to our Breakthrough Device discussions with FDA, we intend to extend enrollment in the ESOGUARD-BE-1 screening study until it is sufficiently powered to support expansion to the above proposed indication for use to include detection of dysplastic BE. FDA indicated that although they would have preferred to a study powered for HGD, they understood that the study size would be impracticable and that they would be open to including LGD. It also indicated that it would consider study designs with some enrichment and, potentially, interim analysis and approval to mitigate sample size. We will be working with FDA to finalize an extension of our current screening study to support such an expanded dysplastic BE indication once FDA resumes Breakthrough Device meetings for IVD devices, which are currently on hold as the branch works to clear a Covid-19 pandemic related backlog. This study will be a substantial, capital-intensive, but potentially highly rewarding undertaking. Although the study size is yet to be determined and will depend on negotiations with FDA, it will be in the thousands.
 
EsoGuard Clinical Utility Studies
 
Demonstrating EsoGuard clinical utility requires providing evidence that it has a meaningful impact on the clinical care of patients undergoing the procedure. It does not require demonstrating the performance of the assay, i.e., the negative and positive predictive values. Our PMA trials are designed and powered to do so. Clinical utility studies need to demonstrate that patients with a positive EsoGuard test undergoes confirmatory EGD which leads to a specific intervention, e.g., implementation of an NDBE surveillance program or ablation of dysplastic BE. Ideally, the near-term EGD rate of EsoGuard negative patients should be low. In other words, EsoGuard testing should be able to triage patient to EGD vs. no EGD, with EGD positive patients receiving an intervention, which would not have happened if the patient had not been triaged by EsoGuard.
 
Demonstrating EsoGuard’s clinical utility is very important for a variety of purposes, including, importantly, for private payor payment and coverage. Our recent advisor board meeting with medical directors of private insurers confirmed this. They strongly indicated that one of the most important factors in their future decision to grant payment and coverage will be demonstrating that physicians order the test and, when they do, that clinical utility can be demonstrated.
 
Clinical utility studies are also important for general EsoGuard commercialization to physician who want to know that it can “find disease”. A recent U.K. study from Dr. Fitzgerald’s team is a good example. They published a large study of GERD patients in a primary care setting who underwent screening with Cytosponge/TFF-3 and showed that they were able to identify patients with BE and the occasional EAC. This was not a performance study with routine EGD so the authors could not say how many BE-EAC patients were missed, which was likely non-trivial given the published data on suboptimal Cytosponge/TFF-3 performance. However, the study was useful in convincing U.K. authorities to initiate mobile testing centers around the country.
 
We shortly will launch an EsoGuard Registry study as our primary study to demonstrate clinical utility. Every patient undergoing EsoCheck testing will be asked to provide informed consent for us to collect limited post-procedural data from the patient’s physician on care received after EsoGuard testing, most importantly whether they underwent EGD and, if so, what the results showed.
 
We are also in discussions with a large academic medical center to initiate a clinical utility study in which investigators would use the network-wide electronic medical record to systematically identify at-risk GERD patients, offer them EsoGuard testing and compare them to historical controls also identified from the database. The study would seek to demonstrate that an EsoGuard-guided strategy identifies more BE-EAC patient than historical practice.
 
Finally, we are helping investigators at a VA medical center launch a Department of Defense supported study to compare the positive predictive value of EsoGuard followed by EGD compared to EGD alone and the relative costs of each strategy. The study would seek to demonstrate that EsoGuard increases the positive rate of EGD, an important measure of the clinical utility of a noninvasive diagnostic test.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis Using EsoCheck
 
We are exploring additional EsoCheck applications beyond our core focus of BE-EAC. The application with the greatest potential may be the monitoring of patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (“EoE”). EoE is a rapidly emerging allergy-mediated inflammatory condition of the esophagus similar to, and often associated with, inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”). Although underappreciated by the medical community and frequently confused with GERD, EoE has a prevalence comparable to IBD and exacts a significant burden on patients. It can lead to swallowing difficulties, esophageal scarring, food impaction and pain. Current treatment includes oral steroids and an elimination diet. Several anti-inflammatory biologics are being evaluated to treat EoE. Since inflammation can persist despite resolution of symptoms, treatment courses can be very difficult and costly for patients, requiring multiple and frequent invasive endoscopies with biopsies. To date, efforts to replace endoscopy with a noninvasive diagnostic device have proven unsuccessful.


In March 2020, we entered into a clinical trial research agreement with the University of Pennsylvania to perform a pilot study to assess whether EsoCheck can detect the eosinophils characteristic of active EoE and potentially serve as a less-invasive, more efficient, and cost-effective alternative to endoscopic biopsies in the management of EoE patients. The study, entitled “Pilot Study of EsoCheck Compared to Biopsies and Brush Cytology During Endoscopy for Evaluation of Eosinophilic Esophagitis”, was led by Gary W. Falk, M.D., an internationally renowned expert on esophageal disease with specific experience and expertise in the management of EoE. The study, which has been completed, was a prospective cross-sectional pilot feasibility study of ten patients with suspected or established EoE scheduled for a clinically indicated upper endoscopy. The patients underwent esophageal sampling using EsoCheck, with the sample sent for traditional cytologic analysis, followed by EGD, including brushings and biopsies. The study results have yet to be published but preliminary reports indicate that EsoCheck is able to detect a meaningful number of eosinophils in patients with active disease. We have already initiated discussions with Dr. Falk to lead a larger multicenter follow-up study powered to document EsoCheck’s sensitivity and specificity in detecting active EoE, compared to EGD with brushings and biopsy.
 
EsoGuard and EsoCheck Intellectual Property
 
Our Diagnostics business will depend on proprietary medical device and diagnostic technologies, including the EsoCheck and EsoGuard technology licensed by us. We intend to vigorously protect our proprietary technologies’ intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. Patent protection and other proprietary rights are thus essential to our Diagnostics business. The EsoCheck and EsoGuard technology is protected by patents in the United States and internationally, and our policy is to continue to aggressively file patent applications, both independently and in collaboration with CWRU, as appropriate, to protect this technology and other proprietary technologies of ours relating to our Diagnostics business, including inventions and improvements to inventions. Under the CWRU License Agreement, CWRU has agreed to apply for patent coverage, at our expense, in any country requested by us, to the extent such protection is reasonably attainable. We seek patent protection, as appropriate, on:
 

● | the product itself including all embodiments with future commercial potential; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the methods of using the product; and 
● | the methods of manufacturing the product. 

 
In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we intend to file counterpart patent applications in Canada, the European Union and other countries worldwide. Foreign filings can be cumbersome and expensive, and we will pursue such filings when we believe they are warranted as we try to balance our international commercialization plans with our desire to protect the global value of the technology.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent.

We intend to continuously reassess and fine-tune our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify the position of our Diagnostics business in the United States and internationally. Prior to acquiring or licensing a technology from a third party, we will evaluate the existing proprietary rights, our ability to adequately obtain and protect these rights and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others.
 
We will also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position in our Diagnostics business. We intend to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors and other entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. All our consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign to us all new and improved intellectual property that arise during the term of the agreement.
 
EsoGuard and EsoCheck Competition
 
The U.S. market for esophageal cancer (i.e., EAC) and pre-cancer (i.e., BE, with or without dysplasia) screening is large, consisting of more than 30 million at-risk individuals over the age of 50. Given the large market for pre-cancer screening, we likely will face numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our EsoGuard test faces competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as upper endoscopy, and other screening technologies such as pill-based imaging solutions like PillCam Eso, cleared by the FDA in November 2004, and transnasal esophagoscopy, a flexible tube with a miniature camera that is inserted into the nose and advanced through the esophagus into the upper portion of the stomach. Our EsoCheck device faces competition from other manufactures with devices designed to collect cell samples from targeted regions of the esophagus. For example, Cytosponge is a small mesh sponge within a soluble gelatin capsule that dissolves in the stomach and then is pulled thru the targeted region brushing the lining of the esophagus and then later retrieved, although, unlike EsoCheck, it is unprotected from contamination. Interpace Diagnostics (Nasdaq: IDXG), NeoGenomics (Nasdaq: NEO) and Cernostics (private) are developing progression type test for known patients with BE aimed at assessing or predicting the likely development of EAC. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting esophageal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
 
Accordingly, the market for our Diagnostics products is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. In order to compete effectively, EsoGuard and EsoCheck will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | diagnostic accuracy and the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by physicians and the medical device market generally; 
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 

 
Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or more cost efficient, or because of they have access to greater resources than us. These competitors may have greater name recognition than we do. Many of these competitors have obtained all desirable FDA or other regulatory approvals, and superior patent protection, for their products. Certain of our competitors have already commercialized their products, and others may commercialize their products in advance of our products. In addition, our competitors may make technical advances that render our products obsolete. We may be unable to respond to such technical advances.
 
Notwithstanding that the market for BE and EAC screening is highly competitive, we believe that EsoCheck, currently cleared by the FDA pursuant to a 510(k), and EsoGuard, the first and only DNA-based non-invasive BE screening LDT test on the market today, compare favorably to other available products and services. When used in combination after achieving FDA approval as an IVD medical device through the PMA process, the use of EsoGuard, on samples collected using EsoCheck, may offer an accurate, lower cost, non-invasive approach, that does not require endoscopy, to screen for BE and EAC. The test may be performed in five minutes, without sedation, in an outpatient ambulatory setting such as a primary care or family practice physician’s office or a freestanding diagnostic facility.

License Agreement
 
On May 12, 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with CWRU, which was amended on November 19, 2019, February 12, 2021 and August 23, 2021. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we acquired an exclusive worldwide right to use the intellectual property rights to the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology for the detection of changes in the esophagus. CWRU retains the right to grant licenses to the EsoGuard technology outside this field of use. The November 2019 amendment to the License Agreement also incorporates technology on sample preservation, jointly developed by us and CWRU, as licensed technology under the agreement, on mutually agreeable terms and conditions.
 
CWRU is entitled to receive royalties based on net sales by us of licensed products utilizing the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology. When determining net sales in circumstances where samples collected using a device based on EsoCheck technology are evaluated in a test other than one based on EsoGuard technology, the unit sales price of the device will be deemed to be 200% of the direct unit manufacturing cost (or 400%, if the test is for the detection of EAC or its precursors). We are required to pay CWRU royalties on net sales of licensed products as follows:
 

● | 5% of net sales of less than $100 million per year; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 8% of net sales greater than $100 million per year. 

 
We are also required to pay CWRU minimum annual royalty payments as follows:
 

● | $50,000 per year, beginning January 1 following the first anniversary of a commercial sale of a licensed product; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | $150,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $25 million in a year; 
● | $300,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $50 million in a year; and 
● | $600,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $100 million in a year. 

 
Minimum yearly royalty amounts are subject to increase based on the percentage change in the CPI-W Consumer Price Index. The minimum yearly royalty payment is credited against the royalties otherwise due. We are also required to pay CWRU a specified portion of any other non-royalty proceeds received by us pursuant to a sublicense of the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology.
 
The License Agreement was subject to four regulatory and commercialization milestones, of which one remains unachieved and unpaid. The remaining milestone is the FDA PMA submission of a licensed product, upon the achievement of which we will pay CWRU a milestone payment of $200,000.
 
Under the License Agreement, we are responsible for the costs incurred by CWRU in preparing, filing and prosecuting any patents related to the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology (subject to a provision for cost sharing in the event CWRU grants other non-overlapping licenses to the technology). CWRU agreed to apply for patent coverage, at our expense, in any country requested by us, to the extent such protection is reasonably attainable. CWRU also may apply for patent, copyright or trademark rights to the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology in other countries, at its option, and we will have no rights under any the patents in such countries unless we reimburse CWRU for its expenses. In the event of any actual or threatened infringement of any patent in the field of use covered by the License Agreement, we will have the first right to commence an action against the infringer. We also will have the right to defend against any claims that the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party.
 
The License Agreement provides for us to indemnify CWRU and certain related parties for any claims relating to product liability or similar claims involving acts or omissions by us in connection with the EsoGuard technology and the development, use or sale of products based on such technology, or relating to our gross negligence or willful misconduct, or relating to our breach of the License Agreement, unless, in any case, such claim results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of CWRU.
 
The License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent, or on May 12, 2038, in countries where no such patents exist, or upon expiration of any exclusive marketing rights for a licensed product that have been granted by FDA or other U.S. government agency, whichever comes later. The EsoGuard patents begin to expire in August 2024. However, we are pursuing applications of the clinical utility to extend the patent protection with more recently filed families of cases that have a twenty-year term and, if issued, will expire in the mid to late 2030s. The EsoCheck patents, which are currently the last to expire, begin to expire in May 2035.
 
In addition, in the event that we defaults in the payment of any amount when due under the License Agreement, and such amount is not paid within 30 days of notice of nonpayment, CWRU may terminate the exclusivity of the license or terminate the CWRU License Agreement in full. In addition, either party may terminate the CWRU License Agreement upon the other party’s default in the performance of its obligations under the License Agreement, subject to certain grace periods. Upon expiration of the CWRU License Agreement in the ordinary course, we expect to continue selling products using the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology, as CWRU’s proprietary intellectual property rights in the technology also will have expired.

Our Relationship with PAVmed Inc.
 
We are a majority-owned subsidiary of PAVmed, and PAVmed has a controlling financial interest. We continue to depend on PAVmed to provide us various management, technical, research and development, legal, accounting, and administrative services.
 
PAVmed owns approximately 75.8% as of December 31, 2021 and 74.6% as of March 29, 2022 of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock (with such percentage inclusive of shares of our common stock underlying granted but unvested restricted stock awards). For as long as PAVmed continues to control more than 50% of our common stock, PAVmed will be able to direct the election of all the members of our board of directors. Similarly, PAVmed will have the power to determine matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders without the consent of our other stockholders, to prevent a change in control of us, and to take other actions that might be favorable to PAVmed, without prior notice to other stockholders. PAVmed’s controlling interest may discourage a change of control that other holders of our common stock may favor.

We are party to a management services agreement with PAVmed (the “MSA”). Under the agreement, PAVmed provides management, technical and administrative services to us, including without limitation services related to research and development, regulatory clearance, manufacture, and commercialization of our products, as well as services related to corporate financial, accounting and legal matters. The terms of this agreement are intended to be consistent with the terms that we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties; however, they may actually be more or less favorable. The MSA does not have a termination date, but may be terminated by the Lucid Diagnostics’ board of directors at any time.

Recent Events
 
Committed Equity Financing
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2021, in March 2022, we entered into a committed equity facility with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald (“Cantor”). Under the terms of the facility, Cantor has committed to purchase up to $50 million in shares of our common stock from time to time at our request. While there are distinct differences, the facility is structured similarly to a traditional at-the-market equity facility, insofar as it allows the Company to raise primary equity capital on a periodic basis at prices based on the existing market price.
 
Asset Acquisition from RDx


Subsequent to December 31, 2021, in February 2022, Lucid Diagnostics, Inc. through its wholly owned subsidiary LucidDx Labs, Inc. entered into an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) with ResearchDx, Inc. (“RDx”) Under the APA, LucidDx Labs acquired certain licenses and other related assets necessary to operate a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical laboratory. The acquired assets, together with certain additional assets necessary to commence laboratory operations that were separately purchased by LucidDx Labs, will be used by Lucid to perform the EsoGuard® Esophageal DNA assay, including without limitation DNA extraction, next generation sequencing (“NGS”) and specimen storage, in its own laboratory located in Lake Forest, CA (the “Laboratory”). Prior to consummation of the Transactions, RDx provided such testing and related services for the EsoGuard assay at its own separate CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory. Lucid’s EsoGuard assay is a bisulfite-converted NGS DNA methylation assay performed on surface esophageal cells, which is commercially available in the U.S. as a Laboratory Developed Test and has been shown to be accurate at detecting esophageal precancer and all conditions along the Barrett’s Esophagus-Esophageal Adenocarcinoma spectrum. Under the APA, LucidDx Labs will pay RDx an aggregate purchase price of up to $6.2 million for the acquired assets. Concurrent with the APA, LucidDx Labs and RDx also entered into a management services agreement (“MSA”). The MSA has a term of three years whereby LucidDx Labs will pay up to $1.8 million in quarterly installments.
 
CapNostics, LLC
 
On October 5, 2021, PAVmed Subsidiary Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PAVmed Inc., acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CapNostics, LLC (“CapNostics”) for total (gross) purchase consideration of approximately $2.1 million of cash, paid at the closing of the transaction. In March 2022, both the PAVmed and Lucid board of directors approved entering into a purchase and sale of the CapNostics, LLC assets from PAVmed to Lucid as well as transferring the consulting agreement with the previous principal owner of CapNostics, LLC. The transfer price is $2.1 million for the assets.
 
EsoCure
 
EsoCure has been in development as an Esophageal Ablation Device by PAVmed, with the intent to allow a clinician to treat dysplastic BE before it can progress to EAC, a highly lethal esophageal cancer, and to do so without the need for complex and expensive capital equipment. In March 2022, both the PAVmed and Lucid board of directors have approved entering into an intercompany license between PAVmed and Lucid such that Lucid will be granted the rights to commercialize EsoCure for the treating dysplastic Barrett’s Esophagus, including a royalty arrangement whereby Lucid will pay PAVmed a 5% royalty on all EsoCure sales up to $100 million per calendar year, and 8% above that threshold. Lucid will obligated to fund ongoing development costs and cumulative patent expenses. EsoCure will become part of an integrated suite of Lucid products addressing BE-EAC.

Government Regulation 
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The following is a summary of the government regulations applicable to our business.
 
FDA and Similar Regulation


FDA Regulation
 
For the purposes of FDA regulation a “medical device” is broadly defined in section 201(h) of the FDCA as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, which is intended for use in humans for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.” Medical devices subject to FDA regulation include “in-vitro diagnostic medical devices” or IVD devices, defined in the same FDCA section as “reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae, which are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body”.
 
Our marketing of any medical device product we may develop, license, or acquire, including traditional medical devices such as EsoCheck, and IVD products such as EsoGuard, is subject to FDA regulation.



● | In June 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for EsoCheck, permitting us to market it in the U.S. as a cell collection device indicated for use in the collection and retrieval of surface cells of the esophagus in the general population of adults, 22 years of age and older. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In December 2019, our CLIA-certified laboratory partner ResearchDx Inc., dba PacificDx, completed documentation of EsoGuard analytical validity allowing us to commercialize it as an LDT. In March 2022, we transferred EsoGuard testing to our own CLIA-certified laboratory, upon our acquisition of certain assets from RDx as described elsewhere in this report. 

 
FDA defines an LDT as “an IVD product that is intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory.” FDA has long maintained that it has clear regulatory authority over LDTs and has chosen to fully exercise its authority for certain classes of “single laboratory” IVD products which would satisfy its definition of an LDT, such as direct-to-consumer tests that do not involve a health care provider. FDA, however, has generally not enforced these regulatory requirements for most LDTs not in one of these classes and has generally not required these LDTs to undergo FDA premarket review of analytical validity and clinical validity, as all other IVD products must. For over a decade, FDA has expressed its concern about insufficient regulatory oversight over increasingly high-risk LDTs. On multiple occasions from 2010 to 2020 it announced its intent to reconsider its long-standing policy of LDT enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs but never acted on this intent, limiting its actions to hosting a public workshop to gather feedback from industry stakeholders. publishing two draft guidance documents describing a proposed risk-based framework to LDTs, issuing a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs, and issuing a Discussion Paper on LDTs. FDA never issued a final guidance document on the regulation of LDTs and, in 2020, HHS announced that, effective immediately, it was rescinding all guidance, compliance manuals, website statements, or other informal issuances concerning FDA premarket review of LDTs, and that FDA may not require premarket review of LDTs absent a formal notice-and-comment rulemaking process.


This 2020 HHS directive notwithstanding, the regulatory status for LDTs such as EsoGuard remains somewhat ambiguous and uncertain. The current administration could rescind the HHS directive and allow FDA to return to its previous regime of enforcement discretion. The Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act of 2020, which seeks to revamp the regulatory framework of diagnostic tests, including LDTs, is expected to be reintroduced in 2021 and could radically alter the landscape for LDTs. FDA may also choose to modify its enforcement discretion of elements of its “single laboratory” definition of LDTs which by strict interpretation would require the LDT to have been “designed” at the “single laboratory” and not transferred from another research laboratory, as EsoGuard was.

Since only EsoCheck is FDA cleared, we are not permitted to jointly market it with EsoGuard. This currently is not a significant obstacle to our commercialization efforts, which are almost entirely devoted to marketing EsoGuard. EsoCheck is merely offered, free of charge, as a generic esophageal cell collection device, which is FDA 510(k) cleared to be used to collect samples for any diagnostic test. We believe, however, over the long-term, once our commercialization efforts have gain significant traction, it would be useful to jointly market EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, as a combined product.
 

● | We therefore have decided to pursue FDA PMA approval for EsoGuard, when used on samples collected with EsoCheck, which will allow us to jointly market them as well as provide protection against changes to LDT regulation which could threaten our ability to market EsoGuard as an LDT. In October 2019, we participated in a FDA pre-submission meeting and received feedback on a proposed initial indication for use and the design of our two international multi-center clinical studies to support a PMA application for FDA approval of EsoGuard on samples collected with EsoCheck. We expect to complete enrollment by the end of 2022 and submit our PMA by early 2023. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FDA “Breakthrough Device” is highly-coveted special designation under FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program, established pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act and the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which seeks to offer patients and healthcare providers timely access to medical devices which “provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions” by speeding up their development, assessment and review through (i) enhanced communications (ii) more efficient and flexible clinical study design, including more favorable pre/post market data collection balance and (iii) priority review of regulatory submissions. Once effective, MCIT would provide each Breakthrough Device with four years of national Medicare coverage starting on the date of FDA market authorization. In February 2020 we were granted Breakthrough Device designation for EsoGuard on esophageal samples collected using EsoCheck. Pursuant to this designation, we will be working with FDA to design an extension to our current screening study to support an expanded indication to detect dysplastic BE, once FDA resumes Breakthrough Device meetings for IVD products, which are currently on hold as the branch works to clear a Covid-19 pandemic related backlog.
 
Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, recordkeeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products.
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 
Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations;
 Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post-market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and
 Class III: special controls and approval of a de novo request or PMA application, likely with clinical data requirements.
 
In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no “standardized” requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status but end up clearing a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) clearance with a review of existing bench and animal data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict fully how FDA will classify our products, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market clearance or approval, or even if they will clear or approve our products at all.\
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, could require a de novo request or PMA. In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date may require a PMA. If FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and FDA must approve a de novo request or PMA before marketing can begin.
 

15
--


During the review of a 510(k) submission, FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us as a company.
 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices and Diagnostic Tests
 
One or more clinical trials may be necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or diagnostic tests being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE application to FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE is reviewed by FDA within 30 calendar days after receipt by FDA and FDA can issue a disapproval, conditional approval or full approval for the study to begin depending on the remaining FDA questions following review. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an IRB has approved the study.
 
During any study, the sponsor must comply with FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices and Diagnostic Tests
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to FDA of certain adverse experience associated with use of the product. 

 
We will continue to be subject to inspection by FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the device must be reported to FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in device withdrawal. Device clearances or approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval. We expect to use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products for the foreseeable future we will therefore be dependent on their compliance with these requirements to market our products. We work closely with our contract manufacturers to assure that our products are in strict compliance with these regulations.

Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing
 
Our CLIA-certified laboratory is subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states, including those of California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Florida, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. CLIA provides that a state may adopt different or more stringent regulations than federal law and permits states to apply for exemption from CLIA if the state’s laboratory laws are equivalent to, or more stringent than, CLIA. For example, the State of New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which have received an exemption from CLIA, contain provisions that are in certain respects more stringent than federal law. Therefore, as long as New York maintains a licensure program that is CLIA-exempt, we will need to comply with New York’s clinical laboratory regulations in order to offer our clinical laboratory products and services in New York.
 
Our CLIA-certified laboratory partner has current certificates to perform clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA and certain state laws include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If our CLIA-certified laboratory fails to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Regulation
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated.

Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
Managing the patient’s journey through our upcoming EsoGuard Telemedicine Program and our Lucid Test Centers consistent with the provisions of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute requires very careful coordination between us and our third-party telemedicine partners, which each entity operating within numerous standard operating procedures incorporated in our quality management system. We have established a costly and substantial regulatory and compliance infrastructure for the Lucid Test Centers and EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, including retaining multiple legal and regulatory consultants with specific expertise in this space, establishing and a special Quality & Compliance Committee of our board of directors to provide board-level oversight, and assuring that our contracts with our third-party telemedicine partners comply with the law.
 
Federal False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus noncovered uses.
 
The processing of EsoGuard tests and submissions of claims consistent with the provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, especially for patients who pass through our EsoGuard Telemedicine Program and our Lucid Test Centers, requires very careful coordination between us and our third-party telemedicine partners broadly operating within numerous standard operating procedures incorporated in our quality management system. We have established a costly and substantial regulatory and compliance infrastructure for the Lucid Test Centers and EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, including retaining multiple legal and regulatory consultants with specific expertise in this space, establishing and a special Quality & Compliance Committee of our board of directors to provide board-level oversight, and assuring that our contracts with our third-party telemedicine comply with the law.
 
The government may further prosecute, as a crime, conduct constituting a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike civil claims under the False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.

Physician Payment Sunshine Act
 
There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or “CMS,” released its final rule implementing section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act that imposes new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.”
 
Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, and other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the “FCPA,” prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Healthcare Reform
 
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Alternatively, the shift away from fee-for-service agreements to capitated payment models may support the value of our products which can be shown to decrease resource utilization and lead to cost saving-for both payors and providers.
 
The Affordable Care Act is an example that has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2024 unless congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) established comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Some of our activities, including at our Lucid Test Centers and within our clinical trials, involve interactions with patients and their health information which implicate HIPAA. Our activities also involve us entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities, which also implicate HIPAA. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil money and criminal penalties.
 
Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, which impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of personal information. More state and international privacy laws are being adopted. Many state laws are not preempted by HIPAA because they are more stringent or are broader in scope than HIPAA. Since 2020 we have also had to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which protects personal information other than health information covered by HIPAA. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules. All of these laws may impact our business and may change periodically, which could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool, blood and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 
Self-Referral Law
 
The federal “self-referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.
 
International Regulation
 
In order to market any of our products outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. We may be subject to regulations and product registration requirements in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.

European Union
 
We recently received CE Mark certification for EsoCheck under MDD and completed CE Mark self-certification for EsoGuard, which qualifies as a General IVD, under IVDD, indicating that both may be marketed in CE Mark European countries, namely the European Economic Area (the European Union, Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein), Switzerland, and, until July 1, 2023, the United Kingdom.
 
MDD refers to Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which for nearly three decades provided the essential requirements and conformity assessment procedure that medical devices must undergo to be affixed with a CE Mark and sold in CE Mark European countries. MDD is now obsolete and has been replaced by MDR. MDR refers to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and incorporates several new concepts and registrations, stricter oversight of manufacturers by notified bodies, universal device identification (UDI) marking, and increased post-market surveillance requirements.
 
Similarly, IVDD refers to In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC), which for over twenty years has provided the essential requirements and conformity assessment procedure that in-vitro diagnostic medical devices must undergo to be affixed with a CE Mark and sold in CE Mark European countries. On May 26, 2022, IVDD will be replaced by IVDR, which refers to Regulation (EU) 2017/746, and has an expanded scope, risk-based classification, more rigorous clinical evidence and surveillance requirements, and more stringent documentation.
 
Both MDR and IVDR have sunset provisions for medical device and IVD certifications under MDD and IVD, respectively. Both EsoGuard and EsoCheck will require recertification under their stricter regulations in the coming years. Failure to secure these recertifications under MDR and IVDR will halt our ability to commercialize our products in the CE Mark European countries. As these are entirely new regulations, the cost, time and risk associated with these recertifications is difficult to predict.
 
In addition, the United Kingdom, which is a major target market for us, has left the European Union (“Brexit”) and will transition from CE Mark certification to its own UKCA mark certification. We will need to secure UKCA mark certification for EsoGuard and EsoCheck before their CE Mark certifications expire in the UK. Since this is an entirely new process, it is difficult to predict the cost, time and risk associated with transitioning to UKCA certification.
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice (GMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. Each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
 
Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.

Other Laws
 
Occupational Safety and Health
 
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare-related facilities. In addition, because our operations may require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
Specimen Transportation
 
Our commercialization activities for EsoGuard subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
Environmental
 
The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our Diagnostics business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Employees


The daily operations of Lucid Diagnostics are managed by personnel employed by PAVmed, for which Lucid Diagnostics Inc. incurs a service fee (the “MSA Fee”), according to the provisions of the MSA. Lucid Diagnostics recognized employee related costs for employees spending all of their time working for Lucid Diagnostics products, services and business activities. Additionally, the Company is charged a MSA Fee under the MSA for the percentage of other employees providing services to Lucid Diagnostics Inc.
