 Background 
 Ruth’s Hospitality Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formerly known as Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Inc.  The Company was founded in 1965 when Ruth Fertel mortgaged her home for $22 thousand to purchase “Chris Steak House,” a 60-seat restaurant located near the New Orleans Fair Grounds racetrack. After a fire destroyed the original restaurant, Ruth relocated her restaurant to a new 160-seat facility nearby. As the terms of the original purchase prevented the use of the “Chris Steak House” name at a new restaurant, Ruth added her name to that of the original restaurant—thus creating the “Ruth’s Chris Steak House” brand. 
 The Company’s expansion began in 1972, when Ruth opened a second restaurant in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. In 1976, the first franchisee-owned Ruth’s Chris Steak House opened in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 2005, the Company and certain selling shareholders completed an initial public offering of the Company’s common stock, which is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “RUTH”.

Expand Relationships with New and Existing Franchisees and Others

The Company believes that building relationships with quality franchisees is a cost-effective way to grow and strengthen the Ruth’s Chris brand and generate additional revenues. The Company intends to continue to focus on providing operational guidance to its franchisees, including the sharing of “best practices” from Company-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants.

Menu
 The Ruth’s Chris menu features a broad selection of high-quality USDA Prime grade steaks and other premium offerings served in Ruth’s Chris signature fashion—“sizzling” on a 500 degree plate and topped with butter and fresh parsley—complemented by other classic American steakhouse menu items. USDA Prime is the highest meat grade level, which refers to the superior quality and evenly distributed marbling that enhances the flavor of the steak. The Ruth’s Chris menu also includes premium quality lamb chops, fish, shrimp, crab, chicken and lobster. 
 The Ruth’s Chris restaurants offer ten to thirteen standard appetizer items, including New Orleans-style barbequed shrimp, mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat, spicy shrimp, chilled seafood tower and osso bucco ravioli, as well as six to eight different salads. They also offer a variety of potatoes and vegetables as side dishes. For dessert, crème brûlée, white chocolate bread pudding, chocolate duo, cheesecake, fresh seasonal berries with sweet cream and other selections are available. 
 The Company’s wine list features bottles typically ranging in price from $46 to over $1,000. Individual restaurants may supplement their 250-bottle core wine list with approximately 20 additional selections that reflect local market tastes. Most of the Company’s Ruth’s Chris restaurants also offer approximately 33 wines-by-the-glass, 13-16 handcrafted cocktails and numerous beers, premium liquors and alcoholic dessert drinks. 
 Dinner entrees are generally priced from $32 to $99.  Ruth’s Chris is predominately open dinner hours only with a limited number of restaurants open for lunch.  The lunch menu offers entrees generally ranging in price from $13 to $29.  The blended guest check average at Ruth’s Chris was approximately $85 during fiscal year 2018 with food sales representing 77% of the guest check and the remainder represented by beverage sales.  While the Ruth’s Chris core menu is similar at all of its restaurants, the Company seasonally introduces new items such as limited time and prix fixe offerings that allow it to give its guests additional choices while taking advantage of fresh sourcing and advantageous cost opportunities.
 Restaurant Operations and Management
 The Ruth’s Chris Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Operations have primary responsibility for managing Company-owned restaurants and participate in analyzing restaurant-level performance and strategic planning. The Company has ten regional vice presidents who oversee restaurant operations at Company-owned restaurants, one vice president to whom the regional vice presidents report and one vice president who has oversight responsibility for franchisee-owned restaurants. In addition, restaurant education and training is overseen by a regional staff dedicated to the ongoing training and development of customer service employees and kitchen staff. 
 A typical Company-owned restaurant employs five managers, including a general manager, two front-of-the-house managers, an executive chef and a sous chef. The Company-owned restaurants also typically have approximately 60 hourly employees. 
 Purchasing
 The Company’s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurants depends in part upon its ability to acquire food and other supplies from reliable sources in accordance with its specifications. Purchasing at the restaurant level is directed primarily by the executive chef, who is trained in the Company’s purchasing philosophy and specifications, and who works with regional and corporate managers to ensure consistent sourcing of fish, produce and other supplies. 
 During fiscal year 2018, the Company purchased substantially all the beef it used in Company-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants from two vendors, Sysco Specialty Meat Group (a subsidiary of Sysco) and Stock Yards Packing (a subsidiary of US Foods).  Each vendor supplied about half of the Company’s beef requirements.  In addition, the Company has a distribution arrangement with a national food and restaurant supply distributor, Distribution Market Advantage, Inc. (DMA), which purchases products for the Company from various suppliers and through which all the Company-owned Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants receive a significant portion of their food supplies. 
 Quality Control 
 The Company strives to maintain quality and consistency in its Company-owned restaurants through careful training and supervision of personnel and standards established for food and beverage preparation, maintenance of facilities and conduct of personnel. The primary goal of the Company’s training and supervision programs is to ensure that its employees display the characteristics of its brand and values that distinguish it from its competitors. Restaurant managers in Company-owned restaurants must complete a training program that is typically seven to eight weeks long, during which they are instructed in multiple areas of restaurant management, including food quality and preparation, guest service, alcoholic beverage service, liquor regulation compliance and 
 3

employee relations. Restaurant managers also receive operations manuals relating to food and beverage preparation and restaurant operations. Restaurant managers are certified by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation for food safety.
 In addition to our internal quality control measures, the Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants also employ an independent third-party food safety firm to ensure proper training, food safety and the achievement of the highest standards for cleanliness throughout the restaurant through routine quarterly unannounced inspections. The Company instructs chefs and assistants on safety, sanitation, housekeeping, repair and maintenance, product and service specifications, ordering and receiving food products and quality assurance.  At the Ruth’s Chris restaurants, the executive chef, together with the restaurant managers, oversees a line check system of quality control and must complete a quality assurance checklist verifying the flavor, presentation and proper temperature of the food and beverages. 
 Marketing and Promotions
 The goals of the Company’s marketing efforts are to increase restaurant sales by attracting new guests, increasing the frequency of visits by current guests, enhancing the guest experience, driving innovation, improving brand recognition in new markets or markets where it intends to open a restaurant and to communicate the overall uniqueness, value and quality exemplified by our restaurants. The Company uses multiple media channels to accomplish these goals and complements its national advertising with targeted local media such as print, digital media, search engine marketing, radio and outdoor billboards. 
Advertising
 In fiscal year 2018, the Company spent $16.6 million, or 3.7% of its revenues, in total marketing and advertising expenditures, which included spending on national media, consisting primarily of paid search, online advertising, online initiatives, traditional public relations and consumer research. During fiscal year 2018, the Company continued to optimize its online marketing efforts, using a variety of tactics including paid search, digital advertising and paid social media advertising. The Company’s online strategy also included an emphasis on continued website improvement and targeted emails with special offers and announcements, as well as emails regarding seasonal specials, holiday offers and personalized birthday and anniversary invitations. In fiscal year 2018, Ruth’s Chris Steak House continued its participation in co-branded campaign with American Express Membership Rewards program. Many of the Company’s restaurants also schedule events to strengthen community ties and increase local market presence. The Company’s franchisees also conduct their own local media and advertising plans. 
Gift Cards
 The Company sells Ruth’s Chris gift cards at most of its Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurants, including franchises, on its website and through its toll-free number. E-gift cards, which may be purchased on the Company’s e-commerce gift card website, are emailed directly to the recipient and are redeemable in the same manner as a plastic gift cards.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, Ruth’s Chris entered into a distribution agreement where Ruth’s Chris gift cards are sold in third-party retail outlets.  Offering gift cards at third-party retailers and e-gift cards gives Ruth’s Chris the opportunity to maximize last-minute gift-giving and address its patrons’ requests for convenient, immediate purchases.   Ruth’s Chris patrons frequently purchase gift cards for holidays, including
 Christmas, Hanukkah, Valentine’s Day, Mothers’ Day and Fathers’ Day, and other special occasions.  In fiscal year 2018, Company and franchise sales of Ruth’s gift cards aggregated approximately $67.2 million system-wide, compared to $65.4 million in fiscal year 2017. Ruth’s Chris gift cards are redeemable at both Company and franchisee owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants.
Franchise Program and Relationship
 Under the Company’s franchise program, the Company offers certain services and licensing rights to the franchisee to help maintain consistency in system-wide operations. The Company’s services include training of personnel, construction assistance, providing the new franchisee with standardized operating procedures and manuals, business and financial forms, consulting with the new franchisee on purchasing and supplies and performing supervisory quality control services. The Company conducts reviews of its franchisee-owned restaurants on an ongoing basis in order to ensure compliance with its standards. 
 As of December 30, 2018, the Company’s 75 franchisee-owned Ruth’s Chris restaurants are owned by 27 franchisees with the three largest franchisees owning 32 restaurants in total. 
 Under the Company’s current franchise program, each franchise arrangement consists of a development agreement, if multiple restaurants are to be developed, with a separate franchise agreement executed for each restaurant. The Company’s current form of development agreement grants exclusive rights to a franchisee to develop a minimum number of restaurants in a defined area, typically during a three-to-five-year period. Individual franchise agreements govern the operation of each restaurant opened and have a 20-year term with two renewal options each for additional ten-year terms if certain conditions are met. The Company’s current form 
 4

of franchise agreement requires franchisees to pay a 5% royalty on gross revenues plus up to a 1% advertising fee applied to national advertising expenditures.
 Under the Company’s current form of development agreement, and unless agreed otherwise, the Company collects a $50 thousand development fee, which is credited toward the $150 thousand franchise fee, for each restaurant the franchisee has rights to develop. Under the Company’s current form of the franchise agreement, it collects up to $150 thousand of the full franchise fee at the time of executing the franchise agreement for each restaurant. If one restaurant is to be developed, a single unit franchise agreement is executed and the $150 thousand franchise fee is collected at signing. 
 Information Systems and Restaurant Reporting
 All of the Company’s restaurants use computerized point-of-sale systems, which are designed to promote operating efficiency, provide corporate management timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce restaurant and corporate administrative time and expense. These systems record each order and print the food requests in the kitchen for the cooks to prepare. The data captured for use by operations and corporate management includes gross sales amounts, cash and credit card receipts and quantities of each menu item sold. Sales and receipts information is generally transmitted to the corporate office daily.
 The Company’s corporate systems provide management with operating reports that show Company-owned restaurant performance comparisons with budget and prior year results. These systems allow the Company to monitor Company-owned restaurant sales, food and beverage costs, labor expense and other restaurant trends on a regular basis. 
 Service Marks 
 The Company has registered the main service marks “Ruth’s Chris” and its “Ruth’s Chris Steak House, U.S. Prime & Design” logo, as well as other service marks used by its restaurants, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in the foreign countries in which its restaurants operate. The Company has also registered in other foreign countries in anticipation of new store openings within those countries. The Company is not aware of any infringing uses that could materially affect its business. The Company believes that its service marks are valuable to the operation of its restaurants and are important to its marketing strategy. 
Seasonality 
 The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the percentage of its annual revenues earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters have been higher due, in large part, to increased restaurant sales during the year-end holiday season and the popularity of dining out in the fall and winter months. 
Employees 
 As of December 30, 2018, the Company employed 5,408 persons, of whom 493 were salaried and 4,915 were hourly personnel, who were employed in the positions set forth in the table below. None of the Company’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Government Regulation
 The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public health and safety, zoning and fire codes and the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. The Company maintains the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state laws govern the Company’s relationship with its employees, 
 5

including laws relating to minimum wage requirements, overtime, tips, tip credits and working conditions. A significant number of the Company’s hourly employees are paid at rates related to the federal or state minimum wage. During 2018, governmental entities acted to increase minimum wage rates in several jurisdictions wherein Company-owned restaurants are located. Additionally, the federal government may act to increase the U.S. federal minimum wage rate. 
 The offer and sale of franchises are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and many states. The FTC requires that the Company furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. A number of states also regulate the sale of franchises and require state registration of franchise offerings and the delivery of a franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees. The Company’s noncompliance could result in governmental enforcement actions seeking a civil or criminal penalty, rescission of a franchise, and loss of its ability to offer and sell franchises in a state, or a private lawsuit seeking rescission, damages and legal fees. 
 The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. The Company is subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. Beginning in May 2018, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) has required restaurant companies, such as the Company, to disclose calorie information on their menus. The Food and Drug Administration has rules to implement this provision that require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. A number of states, counties and cities have also enacted menu labeling laws requiring restaurant companies, such as the Company, to disclose certain nutrition information on their menus, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants some of which are preempted by the federal law. Many of the current requirements are inconsistent or are interpreted differently from one jurisdiction to another. The long-term effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time. 
 The Company maintains an employee benefits program that provides self-insured and insured coverage to employees that meet the applicable requirements under the program. Employees can elect to enroll dependents that meet eligibility criteria. Coverage includes health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, life insurance and other voluntary ancillary benefits. Employees share in the cost of other coverage at varying levels. The Company has historically funded a majority of the cost of employee health benefits. The ACA requires that employers 
offer health care coverage that is qualified and affordable. Coverage must be offered to all “full-time” employees, as defined by the ACA. The Company routinely reviews its health benefit plans to assure conformity with the ACA. The hours of service eligibility criteria the Company requires for health benefits are lower than required under the ACA. Approximately 62% of eligible employees elect to participate in the Company’s health benefit plans.
 Competition 
 The restaurant business is highly competitive and highly fragmented, and the number, size and strength of the Company’s competitors vary widely by region. The Company believes that restaurant competition is based on, among other things, quality of food products, customer service, reputation, restaurant location, atmosphere, name recognition and price. The Company’s restaurants compete with a number of upscale steakhouses and upscale casual seafood restaurants within their markets, both locally owned restaurants and restaurants within regional or national chains. The principal upscale steakhouses with which the Company competes are Fleming’s, The Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky, The Palm, Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse, Fogo de Chão, Morton’s The Steakhouse, Eddie V’s and other local fine dining restaurants. The Company’s competitors may be better established in certain of the Company’s existing markets and/or markets into which the Company intends to expand.

The Company makes available free of charge, through the investor relations section of its website, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports electronically filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
