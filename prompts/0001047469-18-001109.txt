     Overview 
         We are a leading education technology company that well-recognized nonprofit colleges and universities trust to bring them into the digital age. Our comprehensive platform of tightly integrated technology and services provides the digital infrastructure universities need to attract, enroll, educate and support students at scale. With our platform, students can pursue their education anytime, anywhere, without quitting their jobs or moving; and university clients can improve educational outcomes, skills attainment and career prospects for a greater number of students. 
         Over the past decade, we have developed new and innovative tools within our platform to enhance the effectiveness of instructional methods and improve student outcomes and the student experience. During that time, we have also refined our program selection algorithm and improved our data-driven digital marketing capabilities across our ecosystem of offerings to generate increased student enrollments in a cost effective manner. As a result, demand for our comprehensive platform of integrated technology and services has increased significantly. Since 2008, we have expanded our university client base from one to 24 across our entire portfolio of offerings, increased the number of 2U-powered graduate programs from one to 37, and enrolled over 33,000 graduate students. 
         Our core strategy is to launch graduate programs and short courses with new and existing university clients and to increase student enrollments across our portfolio. We are also committed to continuously improving our platform to deliver high-quality university and student experiences and outcomes at scale. 
   Business Segments 
         Beginning in July 2017, with the closing of our acquisition of GetSmarter, we began offering premium online short courses to students not seeking a full graduate degree. As a result of the GetSmarter acquisition, we have two reportable segments: the Graduate Program Segment and the Short Course Segment. 
         In both our Graduate Program Segment and our Short Course Segment, we provide well-recognized nonprofit colleges and universities with the comprehensive infrastructure they need to attract, enroll, educate and support students in their 2U-enabled graduate program or short course. In our Graduate Program Segment, we target students seeking a full graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on-campus. In our Short Course Segment, we target working professionals seeking career advancement through skills attainment. 
         The reportable segments represent businesses for which separate financial information is utilized by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Our Graduate Program Segment derives revenue primarily from a contractually specified percentage of the amounts our university clients receive from their students in the 2U-enabled graduate program for tuition and fees, less credit card fees and other specified charges we have agreed to exclude in certain of our university client contracts. The Short Course Segment derives revenue directly from students for the tuition and fees paid to enroll in and progress through our short courses. A contractually specified percentage of the tuition and fees received from students is shared with the university client. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 13 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   Our Platform 
         Our platform consists of front-end and back-end cloud-based SaaS technology and technology-enabled services. These two components are tightly integrated and each is optimized with data analysis and machine learning techniques. 
 4

     Front-End Technology and Services 
         We provide the following front-end technology and services to students enrolled in our offerings and to faculty members and university administrators supporting our offerings: 
 

 Online Learning Platform.  Our online learning platform is a secure and
accessible learning and teaching platform, where our university clients can reliably deliver their high-quality educational content to students in a live, intimate and engaging setting, all accessible
through proprietary web and mobile applications. Our online learning platform allows our university clients to provide a personalized learning environment for faculty and students as well as a robust
online educational community. Students can also download their asynchronous coursework for convenient offline consumption. 

On
January 19, 2018, we entered into an agreement to purchase a perpetual source code license for the Learn.co platform from Flatiron School, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of WeWork
Companies, Inc. Once integrated into our online learning platform, we expect that Learn.co will enhance the learning experience of students and instruction capabilities of faculty across our
entire portfolio of offerings. 


 Student and Faculty Support.  We augment each student's academic experience
by providing ongoing personalized non-academic support. We also provide a dedicated team to support and train university administration and faculty on how to use our platform to facilitate outstanding
live instruction. 
 Accessibility.  For students with disabilities, we are able to facilitate
accessibility across our platform. This includes providing screen-reading technology, captioning, subtitling and voice-over descriptions for asynchronous content, and sign language interpretation and
real time captioning for live classes. 
 Admissions Application Advising.  Leveraging our customer relationship
management deployments and other technology, our graduate program-dedicated teams work with prospective students as they consider and apply to a program. Once a student has submitted a completed
admissions application package, it is routed to and reviewed by the university admissions office, which renders the final admission decision. 
 In-Program Student Field Placements.  Leveraging our nationwide network of
clinics, hospitals, schools and other sites, our field placement team is dedicated to securing in-program field placement opportunities for students enrolled in our university clients' graduate
programs that have a field placement component. Leveraging a geo-location database, we work closely with faculty to identify and approve sites that meet curriculum requirements. 
 Immersion Support.  Many of our university clients' graduate programs
require students to attend immersions and intensive residencies where students travel to a university client's physical campus and other locations, where they can engage in collaborative learning
experiences with their classmates and professors in person, and develop invaluable personal and professional relationships. We provide the resources and technology to support our university clients in
facilitating these experiences. 
 Faculty Recruiting.  Using our platform, our university clients can identify
and employ highly qualified teaching faculty without geographic constraint. We effectively act as a search firm by attracting, cultivating and vetting a pool of faculty candidates for our university
clients. 

 5

     Back-End Technology and Services 
         We provide the following back-end technology and services to launch and operate our offerings: 
 

 Graduate Program Launch and Operations Applications.  We use an application
we call Central Park to unify our suite of applications and better automate the standup of technology infrastructure for new graduate programs. We also use an application we call Uber-Conf to
translate graduate program-specific code into a common language to simplify program-specific complexity. These applications simplify the effort to launch new graduate programs and enable
non-technology oriented employees to support the data analytics and operational needs across our business. 
 University Systems Integration Applications.  We use an application we call
Port Authority to integrate our technology with our university clients' information technology systems. This application automates the student enrollment process, which allows us to more efficiently
and quickly enroll students, thereby increasing our student-to-support staff ratios, while reducing the potential for human error. 
 Content Management System.  Our content management system enables us and our
university clients to author, review and deploy the asynchronous content for our offerings. The content management system includes a set of project management and collaboration tools that allow our
university clients' faculty to seamlessly integrate their work with that of our course production and content development staff. 
 Admissions Application Processing Portal.  Our proprietary admissions
application system, known as the Online Application and Recommendation System, or OARS, automates the graduate program admissions application process. OARS is integrated with the primary marketing
site for each graduate program and directly using data analysis and machine learning techniques, funnels prospective students into each university client's existing admissions application process and
provides automated workflow for that process. 
 Customer Relationship Management.  We have developed customer relationship
management deployments configured for each university client's specific graduate program. Each deployment serves as the data hub for scheduling, student acquisition, student application, faculty
admissions review, enrollment and student support. Our university clients and our employees review, maintain and track this information to ensure proper coordination. 
 Content Development.  Leveraging our content management system, our content
development staff works closely with our university clients' faculty in a collaborative process to produce high-quality, engaging online coursework and content. 
 Student Acquisition.  Leveraging data analytics and machine learning
techniques, we develop targeted, offering-specific digital marketing campaigns that can reach and engage interested and qualified prospective students in a cost-effective manner. Our marketing teams
also develop creative assets, such as websites related to the graduate program and short course fields of study, and execute search engine optimization and paid search campaigns aimed at acquiring
students cost-effectively. 
 State Authorization Services.  Many of our offerings must comply with state
authorization requirements in each state where students reside. We work with most of our university clients to identify and satisfy a complex array of state authorization requirements. 

 6

     Our Approach 
         Our approach in providing our platform to our university clients is as follows: 
 

 Tightly Integrated Technology and Services with a Focus on
Quality.  We believe that our platform offers extensive features, high configurability, an intuitive user interface and the ability to support
synchronous and asynchronous learning at scale. Our front-end and back-end technology and services are tightly integrated, and together they provide a broad set of capabilities that would otherwise
require universities to purchase multiple, disparate point solutions, and hire significant human resources and expertise. 
Data-Driven Methodology.


 Proprietary Algorithm.  We have developed a proprietary program-selection
algorithm to optimize our process for identifying new graduate programs that have a high likelihood of success. Following our acquisition of GetSmarter, we have deployed this algorithm to inform our
short course selection process as well. Our algorithm draws on a wide variety of data, including the operating history of our existing offerings, and is based on key market variables, such as the
existing market size of an offering, potential student demographics and university characteristics. 
 Marketing.  We believe that our continuously expanding selection of
educational offerings increases our marketing leverage, allowing us to acquire additional students for the same cost and increase enrollments across our entire portfolio of offerings. In addition, we
use data analytics and machine learning techniques to focus our marketing efforts on finding prospective students for the right offerings at times when conversion is more likely. 

 Alignment with University
Clients.  We serve as brand stewards for our university clients and our relationships are characterized by close, ongoing collaboration with
faculty and administrators, as well as a deep integration between their academic missions and our platform. Our revenue-share model also aligns our interests with those of our university clients. This
revenue model, combined with long contractual terms, enables us to make the investment in technology, integration, content production, marketing, student and faculty support and other services
necessary to launch and scale successful offerings, without significant financial risk to our university clients. 
 Driving High Quality Student
Outcomes.  We are committed to delivering the technology and services required to support each student throughout the life of each offering,
thereby improving the likelihood of students' achieving their desired educational outcomes, skills attainment and career opportunities. 

 Our Growth Strategy 
         We intend to continue our industry leadership as a provider of a digital education platform that enables well-recognized nonprofit colleges and universities to deliver education online. Our approach to growth is disciplined and focused on long-term success. The principal elements of our strategy are to: 


 Add Graduate Programs, Short Courses, University Clients and
Students.  We intend to add graduate programs and short courses with new and existing university clients, and increase student enrollments across
our entire portfolio of offerings. 
 Add New Categories of
Offerings.  We believe that there is significant international demand for our platform as colleges and universities worldwide seek to extend their
brands by accessing the growing global market for higher education. We also believe that there may be significant opportunities in the future to offer high-quality digital education experiences to
undergraduate students and expand our non-degree offerings. As we evaluate these growth strategies, we 

 7

   

periodically
consider acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to add product
offerings, extend our technological leadership or expand the markets in which we operate. We expect to continue to evaluate, and may enter into, acquisitions and investments in the future as
opportunities are presented. 


 Clients 
   Graduate Program Segment 
         In our Graduate Program Segment, we have grown our university client and program base significantly since our inception from one client with one program in one academic discipline in 2008 to 24 clients with 51 programs in 23 degree verticals today, 37 of which have launched and have students enrolled. A full listing of all 51 announced programs, including the programs we plan to launch in 2018, can be found at investor.2u.com. 
         Our long-term university client contracts, which typically have 10 to 15 year initial terms, do not include termination rights for convenience. Most contracts impose liquidated damages for a university client's non-renewal, unless the university client otherwise terminates due to our uncured breach. 
         Our contracts also set forth the parties' respective rights to offer competitive programs. For example, some contracts permit us to offer competitive programs with other schools whose potential students are not academically qualified or otherwise interested in the program we offer with our client. Other contracts prohibit us from offering competitive programs with a specific list of schools, whether a certain number as listed on U.S. News & World Report's "best" schools list or a specifically enumerated list of schools negotiated with our university client. In addition, any limitation on our ability to offer competitive programs becomes inapplicable if a university client either refuses to scale the program to accommodate all students qualifying for admission into the program, or raises the program admissions standards above those at the time of contract execution. In addition, our contracts generally prohibit our university clients from offering any online competitive program. Most of our more recent contracts either do not restrict our ability to offer competitive programs or provide for only limited restrictions. 
         For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, 27% and 34%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was derived from our programs with University of Southern California, or USC, including our two longest running programs, launched in 2009 and 2010. We expect that these programs will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue until our other university client graduate programs become more mature and achieve significantly higher enrollment levels. 
         Our programs with Simmons College accounted for 17% and 18% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our programs with the University of North Carolina accounted for 10% and 11% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
   Short Course Segment 
         In our Short Course Segment, we currently have ten university clients we are collaborating with to offer more than 80 courses. Our university client contracts in our Short Course Segment are typically shorter in length and less restrictive than our client contracts in our Graduate Program Segment. 
         In our Short Course Segment, revenue is derived from individual students, rather than directly from university clients. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue associated with our three largest university clients in this segment accounted for approximately 82% of the segment's revenue, which was less than 10% of our consolidated revenue on a combined basis. Of the 12 courses we have 
 8

   launched in 2017, six are with these three university clients. We expect these university clients will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue in the Short Course Segment. 
   Competition 
         The overall market for technology solutions that enable higher education providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of students and educators and frequent introductions of new delivery methods. Several competitors provide platforms that compete with some of the capabilities of our platform. Two such competitors, are Pearson Online Learning Services and Wiley Education Services, owned by Pearson and John Wiley & Sons, respectively, both of which are large education and publishing companies. In addition, traditional massive open online course providers have evolved from providing massive open online courses to providing short course certificates, nano degrees and similar non-degree alternatives. Many of these companies provide components of the technology and services we provide and these companies may choose to pursue some of the institutions we target. Moreover, nonprofit colleges and universities may elect to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house. 
         We expect that the competitive landscape will expand as the market for online education offerings at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

 brand awareness and reputation; 
 ability of online graduate programs and short courses to deliver desired student outcomes; 
 robustness and evolution of technology solutions; 
 breadth and depth of service offering; 
 ability to make significant investments in launching and operating graduate programs; 
 expertise in marketing, student acquisition and student retention; 
 quality of student and faculty experience; 
 ease of deployment and use of technology solutions; 
 level of customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of technology solutions; and 
 quality of university client base and track record of performance. 

         We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, upon our ability to consistently deliver our high-quality platform, meet university client needs for content development, acquire, support and retain students and deliver desired student, faculty and university outcomes. 
   Seasonality 
         We experience seasonality in our marketing and sales expenses in both our Graduate Program Segment and our Short Course Segment. We typically reduce our paid search and other marketing and sales efforts during late November and December because these efforts are less productive during the holiday season. We generally do not experience pronounced seasonality in our revenue, although revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to variations driven by the academic schedules of our graduate programs and short courses.

     Intellectual Property 
         We protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual agreements. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks, including 2U, NO BACK ROW, GETSMARTER and other distinctive logos associated with our brand. 
         We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us that assign any intellectual property rights to us. 
         We have also established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. 
         We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our technology or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our technology and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 
         We continue to evaluate developing and expanding our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. 
         For important additional information related to our intellectual property position, please review the information set forth in "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property." 
   Education Laws and Regulations 
         The higher education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities: the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws. 
         We contract with postsecondary institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we ourselves are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Our failure, or that of our university clients, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our university clients to maintain compliance with education laws. 
   Federal Laws and Regulations 
         Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA, institutions offering postsecondary education must comply with certain laws and related regulations promulgated by the DOE in order to participate in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. Many of our university clients participate in the Title IV programs. 
         The HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA in regular intervals, approximately every five to seven years. The re-authorization process is currently under way. 
         The re-authorization of the HEA could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients. In addition, the DOE is independently conducting an ongoing series of rulemakings intended to assure the integrity of the Title IV programs. The DOE also frequently issues formal and informal guidance 
 10

   instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. DOE guidance is subject to frequent change and may impact our business model. 
         Although we are not considered an institution of higher education and we do not directly participate in Title IV programs, we are required to comply with certain regulations promulgated by the DOE as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions that do participate in Title IV programs. These include, for example, regulations governing student privacy under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA. The most material obligations stem from new rules and revisions to existing regulations promulgated by the DOE in 2010 as part of the so-called "program integrity" rules. 
         While the program integrity rules were targeted at for-profit institutions of higher education, most apply equally to traditional colleges and universities such as our university clients, and they apply in particular to institutions contracting with outside vendors to provide services, particularly in connection with distance education. These rules include principally the incentive compensation rule, the misrepresentation rule, the written arrangements rules and state authorization requirements. The more significant program integrity rules applicable to us or our university clients are discussed in further detail below. 
   Incentive Compensation Rule 
         The HEA provides that any institution that participates in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs must agree with the DOE that the institution will not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities. 
         As part of the program integrity rules, the DOE issued revised regulations regarding incentive compensation effective July 1, 2011. Under the revised regulations, each higher education institution agrees that it will not "provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of title IV, HEA program funds." Pursuant to this rule, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, which are those involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution. 
         In addition, the revised rule initially raised a question as to whether our company itself, as an entity, is prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with university clients. On March 17, 2011, the DOE issued official agency guidance, known as a "Dear Colleague Letter," or the DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that "[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided" and that "[t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees." But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, the DOE does not consider payment based on the amount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an "unaffiliated third party" that provides a set of "bundled services" that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2-B in the DCL is described as a "possible business model" developed "with the statutory mandate in mind." Example 2-B describes the following as a possible business model: 
 
"A
third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution
including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online 

 11

   
delivery
of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, and student career counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the
institution by the entity's activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees,
and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity." 

         The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and the DOE's regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our university clients closely follow Example 2-B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our "covered employees" is paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule. 
         Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could be altered or removed without prior notice, public comment period or other administrative procedural requirements that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in action that does not involve us at all. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court could require us to change our business model. 
   Misrepresentation Rule 
         The HEA prohibits an institution that participates in the Title IV programs from engaging in any "substantial misrepresentation" regarding three broad subject areas: (1) the nature of the school's education programs, (2) the school's financial charges and (3) the employability of the school's graduates. In 2010, as part of the program integrity rules, the DOE revised its regulations in order to significantly expand the scope of the misrepresentation rule. Although some of the DOE's most expansive amendments to the misrepresentation rule were overturned by the courts in 2012, most of the 2010 amendments survived and remain in effect. 
         Under the new rule, "misrepresentation" is defined as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, written, visual or oral. This includes even statements that "have the likelihood or tendency to deceive." Therefore, a statement need not be intentionally deceitful to qualify as a misrepresentation. "Substantial misrepresentation" is defined loosely as a misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. 
         The new regulation also expands the scope of the rule to cover statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just to students or prospective students. 
         Violations of the misrepresentation rule are subject to various sanctions by the DOE and violations may be used as a basis for legal action by third parties. Similar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, applies similar rules prohibiting any unfair or deceptive marketing practices to the education sector. As a result, we and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our university clients, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our university clients. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule and similar rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our university clients before they are used by our employees and we carefully monitor our subcontractors. 
 12

     Accreditation Rules and Standards 
         Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an educational institution, and a grant of accreditation is typically viewed as confirmation that an institution or an institution's programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. The DOE also relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions' educational programs qualify the institutions to participate in Title IV programs. 
         In addition to institutional accreditation, colleges and universities may require specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals to have graduated from accredited programs in order to sit for professional license exams. Programmatic accreditation, while not a sufficient basis for institutional Title IV Program certification by the DOE, assists graduates to practice or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. Common fields of study subject to programmatic accreditation include teaching and nursing. 
         Although we are not an accredited institution and are not required to maintain accreditation, accrediting agencies are responsible for reviewing an accredited institution's third-party contracts with service providers like us and may require an institution to obtain approval from or to notify the accreditor in connection with such arrangements. One purpose of the notification and approval requirements is to verify that the accredited institution remains responsible for providing academic instruction leading to a credential and provides oversight of other activities undertaken by third parties like us that are within the scope of its accreditation. We work closely with our university clients to assure that the standards of their respective accreditors are met and are not adversely impacted by us. 
         Accrediting agencies are also responsible for assuring that any "written arrangements" to outsource academic instruction meet accrediting standards and related regulations of the DOE. Our operations are generally not subject to such "written arrangements" rules because academic instruction is provided by our university client institutions and not by us. 
   State Laws and Regulations 
         Each state has at least one licensing agency responsible for the oversight of educational institutions operating within its jurisdiction. Continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees, diplomas or certificates in those states. Moreover, under the HEA, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. State attorneys general are also active in enforcing education laws, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state. 
         We and our university clients may be subject to regulation in each state in which we or they own facilities, provide distance education or recruit students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, recruiting practices and financial policies. The need to comply with applicable state laws and regulations may limit or delay our ability to market or expand our offerings. In addition, the interpretation of state authorization regulations is subject to substantial discretion by the state agency responsible for enforcing the regulations. 
 13



        As part of the program integrity rules, the DOE required, among other things, that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such approval and provide evidence of such approval to the DOE upon request. This regulation dramatically increased the importance of state authorization because failure to obtain it could result in an obligation to return federal funds received by an institution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the regulations requiring proof of state approval for online education programs in 2012 on procedural grounds; however, the DOE promulgated similar replacement regulations in December 2016, with an effective date of July 1, 2018. In addition, even if these rules do not go into effect, it is the policy of DOE to require proof of all necessary state approvals when an institution seeks to renew its authorization to participate in the Title IV programs. 
         Most states participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, governing the licensing of online offerings. All SARA-member institutions may provide online offerings in SARA states without obtaining separate state authorization (this includes externships, recruiting, local advertising, and faculty presence). SARA-member institutions must still obtain a separate authorization in order to open a physical location in another state and are also required to obtain any additional approvals that may be required for offerings leading to professional licensure in a state (e.g., nursing, teaching, or counseling). Most of our university clients are SARA members and the DOE has indicated it will accept participation in a reciprocity agreement as evidence of state approval. 
         We monitor state law developments closely and work closely with our university clients to assist them with obtaining any required approvals. 
   Other Laws 
         Our activities on behalf of institutions are also subject to other federal and state laws.
