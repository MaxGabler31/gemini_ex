ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
Overview
AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1981. We are a pharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative products to patients with unmet medical needs by leveraging our development and commercial expertise to invest in and grow our pharmaceutical products across a range of therapeutic areas. Our currently marketed products support the health of patients in the areas of maternal and women’s health, anemia management and cancer supportive care, including Feraheme® (ferumoxytol injection) for intravenous (“IV”) use, Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), Intrarosa® (prasterone) vaginal inserts and MuGard® Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse. In addition to our marketed products, our portfolio includes three product candidates, Vyleesi™ (bremelanotide), which is being developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (“HSDD”) in pre-menopausal women, AMAG-423 (digoxin immune fab (ovine)), which is being studied for the treatment of severe preeclampsia, and ciraparantag, which is being studied as an anticoagulant reversal agent.
On January 16, 2019, we acquired ciraparantag with our acquisition of Perosphere Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Perosphere”), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Perosphere Agreement”). Ciraparantag is an anticoagulant reversal agent in development for patients treated with novel oral anticoagulants (“NOACs”) or low molecular weight heparin (“LMWH”) when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these products is needed for emergency surgery, urgent procedures or due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. For additional information, see below under the heading “Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements - Ciraparantag.”
On August 6, 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBR Acquisition Holdings Corp, and the Cord Blood Registry® (“CBR”) business to GI Partners (“GI”), a private equity investment firm, pursuant to the June 14, 2018 Stock Purchase Agreement between us and affiliates of GI. We received $519.3 million in cash at closing and recognized a gain of $87.1 million on the sale during the year ended December 31, 2018. Since August 2015, we had provided services related to the preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cell and cord tissue units operated through CBR. For additional information, see Note C, “Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale”, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We intend to continue to expand the impact of our current and future products for patients by delivering on our growth strategy, which includes collaborating on and acquiring promising therapies at various stages of development, and advancing them through the clinical and regulatory process to deliver new treatment options to patients. Our primary sources of revenue are from sales of Makena, Feraheme and Intrarosa. 
Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the trading symbol “AMAG.”

Feraheme
Overview
Feraheme received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in June 2009 for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD. In February 2018, the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) to expand the label to include all eligible adult IDA patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron in addition to patients who have CKD. With the expanded Feraheme label, we have seen and expect to continue to see increased utilization within hematology and oncology clinics and hospitals, and may also see incremental usage within gynecologists and gastroenterologists. In 2018, sales of Feraheme accounted for approximately 28% of our total net revenues. 
The expanded Feraheme label was supported by two positive pivotal Phase 3 trials, which evaluated Feraheme versus iron sucrose or placebo in a broad population of patients with IDA and positive results from a third Phase 3 randomized, double-blind non-inferiority trial that evaluated the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension with Feraheme compared to Injectafer® (ferric carboxymaltose injection) (the “Feraheme comparator trial”). The Feraheme comparator trial demonstrated comparability to Injectafer® based on the primary composite endpoint of the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension (Feraheme incidence 0.6%; Injectafer® incidence 0.7%). Adverse event rates were similar across both treatment groups; however, the incidence of severe hypophosphatemia (defined by blood phosphorous of <0.2 mg/dl at week 2) was less in the patients receiving Feraheme (0.9% of patients) compared to those receiving Injectafer® (50.8% of patients).
Iron Deficiency Anemia
Currently there are two common methods of iron therapy used to treat IDA: oral iron supplements and IV iron. Oral iron is the first-line iron replacement therapy for most physicians. However, oral iron supplements are poorly absorbed and not well tolerated by some patients, which may adversely impact their effectiveness, and are associated with certain side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea, and cramping, that may adversely affect patient compliance in using such products. In addition, it can take an extended time for hemoglobin levels to improve following the initiation of oral iron treatment, and even then the targeted hemoglobin levels may not be reached. Conversely, iron given intravenously allows larger amounts of iron to be delivered to patients in a shorter time frame while avoiding many of the side effects and treatment compliance issues associated with oral iron, and can result in faster rises in hemoglobin levels. We believe that IV iron is underutilized in IDA patients, and thus a significant opportunity remains to grow the market for IV iron in this patient population. 
IDA is prevalent in many different patient populations. For many of these patients, treatment with oral iron is unsatisfactory or is not tolerated. It is estimated that approximately five million people in the U.S. have IDA and we estimate that a small fraction of the patients who are diagnosed with IDA regardless of the underlying cause are currently being treated with IV iron. We estimate that the size of the total 2018 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.3 million grams, including patients with IDA due to CKD, gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, inflammatory diseases, chemotherapy-induced anemia and abnormal uterine bleeding (“AUB”). 

• | Chronic Kidney Disease: CKD is a progressive condition that leads to chronic and permanent loss of kidney function. It contributes to the development of many complications, including anemia, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid/base abnormalities, bone disease and cardiovascular disease. Anemia, a common condition among CKD patients, is associated with cardiovascular complications, decreased quality of life, hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Anemia can develop early during the course of CKD and worsens with advancing kidney disease.


• | Gastrointestinal Disease: It is estimated that among IDA patients referred to gastroenterologists, the rate of gastrointestinal pathology was found to be approximately 40% - 80%. IDA in patients with gastrointestinal diseases is likely caused by blood loss and/or the inadequate intake or absorption of iron. Oral iron has been used to treat IDA in patients with gastrointestinal diseases, but its efficacy is variable due to inconsistent bioavailability and absorption, the high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and patient noncompliance.


• | Cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia: IDA is also common in patients with cancer, and it is estimated that 32% - 60% of cancer patients have iron deficiency, most of whom are anemic. Iron supplementation through both oral and IV administration plays an important role in treating anemia in cancer patients. While there may be some differences in the underlying causes of anemia and iron deficiency in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy and those who are not, patients in both categories may develop IDA due to blood loss and/or the inadequate intake or absorption of iron. Oral iron has been used to treat IDA in cancer patients, but its efficacy is variable due to inconsistent bioavailability and absorption, a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, potential interactions with other

4

treatments, and patient noncompliance. IV iron has been shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated in the cancer patient population in both patients who are receiving chemotherapy and those who are not.

• | Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: IDA is commonly associated with AUB, which is defined as menstrual flow outside of normal volume, duration, regularity, or frequency. AUB can result from multiple underlying causes, including uterine abnormalities, blood disorders, pregnancy, intrauterine devices, and certain medications. IDA in patients with AUB, regardless of the cause, requires treatment with iron supplementation, either by oral or IV administration.

Post-Approval Commitments for Feraheme 
As part of our post-approval Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme for the treatment of CKD, we had initiated a randomized, active-controlled pediatric study of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in pediatric CKD patients. During 2015, we suspended this trial due to difficulty in enrollment. In December 2016, we met with the FDA to advance the development of a plan in order to satisfy this post-approval commitment for Feraheme and following continued interactions with the FDA regarding the adequacy of our proposed protocol, we amended the protocol and initiated a new pediatric study in 2018. Further, as part of our post-approval PREA requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA for the broader label, we submitted a final protocol to the FDA in mid-2018 with the final report submission due to the FDA in November 2022. 
Makena
Overview
Makena is indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. We acquired the rights to Makena in connection with our acquisition of Lumara Health Inc. (“Lumara Health”) in November 2014.
Makena was approved by the FDA in February 2011 as an intramuscular (“IM”) injection (the “Makena IM product”) packaged in a multi-dose vial and in February 2016 as a single-dose preservative-free vial. The orphan drug exclusivity period that was granted to the Makena IM product in 2011 expired in February 2018. In February 2018, the Makena auto-injector was approved by the FDA for administration via a pre-filled subcutaneous auto-injector, a drug-device combination product. The Makena auto-injector offers an alternative administration option for patients and providers and was designed with features, such as a shorter, thinner, non-visible needle compared to the Makena IM product, to help address some of the known barriers to treatment of recurrent preterm birth, including the lack of patient acceptance and adherence. Our commercial strategy for Makena currently focuses on driving awareness of the availability and attributes of the Makena auto-injector and converting current IM prescribers to the Makena auto-injector. 
In July 2018, simultaneously with the launch of the first generic competitor to Makena, we launched our own authorized generic of both the single- and multi-dose vials through our generic partner, Prasco. As a result of this partnership, we are able to provide patients and healthcare providers with access to therapeutically equivalent versions of the branded Makena IM injection. Currently, there are two generic competitors in the market in addition to the Makena authorized generic product, and we expect additional generic entrants to enter the market in 2019 to compete against both the 1ml and 5ml presentations.
Makena is administered weekly by a healthcare professional with treatment beginning between 16 weeks and 20 weeks and six days of gestation and continuing until 36 weeks and six days of gestation or delivery, whichever happens first. The most common side effects of Makena IM product include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common side effect reported after a single dose of the Makena auto-injector in healthy post-menopausal women was injection site pain. We currently sell Makena primarily to specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, and pharmacies which, in turn, sell Makena to healthcare providers, hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery networks. In 2018, sales of Makena, including the Makena authorized generic, accounted for approximately 68% of our total net revenues. 
Preterm Birth
Makena is a progestin whose active ingredient is hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”), which is a synthetic chemical structurally related to progesterone. Progestins, such as HPC, and progesterone belong to a class of drugs called progestogens. Progestogens have been studied to reduce preterm birth and have shown varying results depending upon the subjects enrolled. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (the “SMFM”) Publications Committee published clinical guidelines for the use of progestogens to reduce the risk of preterm birth in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in May 2012, and which 
5

were reaffirmed in January 2017. The SMFM Clinical Guidelines recommend the use of an IM HPC injection to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth for clinically indicated patients. Further, in its January 2017 reaffirmation of the 2012 SMFM Clinical Guidelines, the SMFM stated that vaginal progesterone should not be considered a substitute for HPC in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.
Preterm birth is defined as a birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), preterm birth affected nearly 400,000 babies born in the U.S. in 2016, or one of every ten infants, with approximately 70% considered late preterm births. In the CDC’s September 2017 National Center for Health Statistics Report, it noted that the preterm birth rate rose in 2016 for the second straight year and attributed the rise primarily to an increase in late preterm births, defined as a birth between 34 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Although the causes of preterm birth are not fully understood, certain women are at a greater risk for preterm birth, including those who have had a previous preterm birth, are pregnant with multiples or have certain uterine or cervical problems. High blood pressure, pregnancy complications (such as placental problems) and certain other health or lifestyle factors may also be contributing factors. Makena is indicated only for use in women who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth who are pregnant with a single baby, which accounts for approximately 140,000 pregnancies annually in the U.S. 
Preterm birth can increase the risk of infant death and can also result in serious long-term health issues for the child, including respiratory problems, gastrointestinal conditions, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing impairments. According to a 2007 report by the Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy Outcome, the annual societal economic cost associated with preterm birth is at least $26.2 billion and includes medical and healthcare costs for the baby, labor and delivery costs for the mother, early intervention and special education services, and costs associated with lost work and pay.
Post-Approval Commitments for Makena
Makena was approved under the provisions of the FDA’s “Subpart H” Accelerated Approval regulations. The Subpart H regulations allow certain drugs, for serious or life-threatening conditions, to be approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval under Subpart H, the FDA required that Makena’s sponsor perform certain adequate and well-controlled post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit of Makena as well as fulfill certain other post-approval commitments. We have recently completed enrollment and follow up of the confirmatory clinical study of Makena and expect to release the data by the end of the first quarter of 2019. A follow-up study of the babies born to mothers from the efficacy and safety clinical study is currently ongoing. We expect to complete the follow up study by July 2020. 
Intrarosa
Overview
In February 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Endoceutics License Agreement”) with Endoceutics pursuant to which Endoceutics granted us the U.S. rights to Intrarosa, an FDA-approved product for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Intrarosa was approved by the FDA in November 2016 and was launched commercially in July 2017.
Intrarosa is the only FDA-approved vaginal non-estrogen treatment indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Intrarosa contains prasterone, a synthetic form of dehydroepiandrosterone (“DHEA”), which is an inactive endogenous (i.e. occurring in the body) sex steroid. Prasterone is converted by enzymes in the body into androgens and estrogens to help restore the vaginal tissue as indicated by improvements in the percentage of superficial cells, parabasal cells, and pH. The mechanism of action of Intrarosa is not fully established. The effectiveness of Intrarosa on moderate to severe dyspareunia in post-menopausal women was examined in two primary 12-week placebo-controlled efficacy trials. Women who used Intrarosa in these trials experienced a significant reduction in moderate to severe dyspareunia, as well as statistically significant improvements in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, parabasal cells and vaginal pH. In these trials, vaginal discharge and atypical pap smears were the most common adverse reactions. Intrarosa is contraindicated in women with undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. The label for Intrarosa contains a precaution that it has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer.

Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy and Dyspareunia
In the U.S., there are an estimated 64 million post-menopausal women, with approximately half, or 32 million, of those women suffering from symptoms of VVA. Of the 32 million women who suffer from symptoms of VVA, we estimate there are approximately 20 million women in the U.S. who suffer from dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, the majority of which we believe suffer from moderate to severe dyspareunia. We estimate that of those women, only 1.7 million are currently being treated with prescription therapy. The Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term national health study, which focused on strategies related to estrogen replacement therapy in post-menopausal women, led to class labeling for all estrogen-containing products, including a boxed safety warning. Intrarosa is not subject to a boxed warning nor any limitations to duration of use as are all other currently approved prescription products to treat VVA. 
Vyleesi
Overview
In January 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Palatin License Agreement”) with Palatin pursuant to which we acquired Vyleesi, an investigational product designed to treat acquired generalized HSDD in pre-menopausal women. In June 2018, the FDA accepted the Vyleesi NDA. The current PDUFA date for completion of FDA review of the Vyleesi NDA is June 23, 2019, and if approved on that date, we expect to launch Vyleesi in the second half of 2019. In November 2018, as part of our discussions with the FDA regarding its review of the NDA submission for Vyleesi, the FDA requested additional data assessing 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure with short-term daily use of Vyleesi. This Phase 1 study is ongoing and is being conducted in premenopausal healthy volunteers. We believe that this study can be conducted and data submitted prior to the June 23, 2019 PDUFA date.
Vyleesi, a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist is designed to be an on demand therapy used in anticipation of sexual activity and self-administered by premenopausal women with HSDD in the thigh or abdomen via a single-use subcutaneous auto-injector. Two identically-designed Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Vyleesi compared to placebo were conducted by Palatin for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women. Both trials consisted of a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group core study phase, comparing a subcutaneous dose of 1.75 mg Vyleesi versus placebo, self-administered via an auto-injector, on demand, and patients were equally randomized (1:1 ratio) to either Vyleesi or placebo. The co-primary endpoints for these trials were evaluated using patient self-reported scores from Question One and Two of the Female Sexual Function Index: Desire Domain (“FSFI-D”) and Question 13 from the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desires/Arousal/Orgasm (“FSDS-DAO”). Women who completed the randomized control core study phase of either study had the option to continue in an ongoing open-label safety extension phase of the study for an additional 52 weeks, which gathered additional data on the safety of long-term and repeated use of Vyleesi. Nearly 80% of patients who completed the randomized portion of the study elected to remain in the open-label portion of the study. All of the patients in the extension study received Vyleesi.
Both studies met the pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints of improvement in low sexual desire and decrease in related distress as measured using validated patient-reported outcome instruments. For women taking Vyleesi compared to placebo, the change from baseline in low sexual desire, as measured by the FSFI-D, showed statistically significant improvement with Vyleesi in both median and mean measures of desire in both Phase 3 studies. The median change from baseline was 0.60 vs. 0.00 for both studies, and the mean change from baseline was 0.54 vs. 0.24 (p=0.0002) for one study and 0.63 vs. 0.21 (p<0.0001) for the other study. Likewise, for women taking Vyleesi compared to placebo, the change from baseline in related distress, as measured by the FSDS-DAO Question 13, also demonstrated statistically significant improvement with Vyleesi in both median and mean measures of desire in both Phase 3 studies. The median change from baseline was -1.0 vs. 0.0 for both studies, and the mean change from baseline was -0.7 vs. -0.4 for both studies, with pValues of <0.0001for one study and 0.0053 for the other study. The change in the number of satisfying sexual events, a key secondary endpoint, was not significantly different from placebo in either clinical trial. 
In the Phase 3 clinical trials, the most frequent adverse events were nausea, flushing, injection site reactions and headache, which were generally mild-to-moderate in severity and were transient. Approximately 18% of patients discontinued participation in the Vyleesi arm due to adverse events in both studies versus 2% in placebo. The adverse events in the extension portion of the study were consistent with that of the controlled studies described above.

Female Sexual Dysfunction and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder
FSD is defined as persistent or recurring problems during one or more of the stages of a woman’s sexual response. It is multi-dimensional and can be caused by physiological, psychological, emotional and/or relational factors. FSD can also have a major impact on a woman’s sexual relationships, interpersonal relationships, quality of life, and even their general well-being. HSDD is the most common type of FSD and is characterized by a lack of sexual thoughts and desire for sexual activity, which causes a woman distress or puts a strain on the relationship with her partner, and cannot be accounted for by another medical, physical or psychiatric condition, co-morbidity of another condition or the effects of a medication. Studies suggest that approximately 15 million women in the U.S. are affected by HSDD and approximately 5.8 million of these women are pre-menopausal and have a primary diagnosis of HSDD. Despite one FDA-approved HSDD therapy on the market today for pre-menopausal women, we believe that patient awareness and understanding of the condition is extremely low, and that few women currently seek treatment. HSDD may go undiagnosed due to various factors such as embarrassment or stigma, lack of awareness of low sexual desire as a medical condition or attribution to other external factors, such as stress or fatigue. Market research commissioned by Palatin indicates that 95% of pre-menopausal women suffering from low desire with associated distress are unaware that HSDD is a treatable medical condition. As a result, assuming FDA approval of our NDA for Vyleesi, we expect that the initial focus of our Vyleesi commercialization efforts will be raising awareness and education about the disease for both healthcare professionals and patients with this disorder. During 2018, we launched an unbranded initiative to bring awareness of the HSDD condition to healthcare professionals. We are also working with and funding the Alliance for Advancing Women’s Health, an organization seeking to improve outcomes for women’s sexual health. 
AMAG-423 
Overview
In September 2018, we exercised our option to acquire the global rights to AMAG-423 pursuant to an option agreement entered into in July 2015 (the “Velo Agreement”) with Velo Bio, LLC, a privately-held life sciences company (“Velo”). AMAG-423 is a polyvalent antibody currently in development for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women and has been granted both orphan drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA. AMAG-423 is intended to bind to endogenous digitalis-like factors (“EDLFs”) and remove them from the circulation. EDLFs appear to be elevated in preeclampsia and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. By decreasing EDLFs, AMAG-423 is believed to improve vascular endothelial function and lead to better post-delivery outcomes in affected mothers and their babies. 
We have assumed responsibility to complete the Phase 2b/3a clinical study that Velo initiated in the second quarter of 2017 and will incur all of the future clinical, regulatory and other costs required to pursue FDA approval. Approximately 200 antepartum women with severe preeclampsia between 23 and 32 weeks gestation will be enrolled in the multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2b/3a study. We have re-initiated the study as the sponsor, and have begun reactivating the current sites, seeking new sites and, as of January 2019, enrolling new patients. Participants in the study receive either AMAG-423 or placebo intravenously four times a day over a maximum of four days. The study’s primary endpoint is to demonstrate a reduction in the percentage of babies who develop severe intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), necrotizing enterocolitis (severe inflammation of the infant bowels) or death by 36 weeks corrected gestational age between the AMAG-423 and placebo arms. Secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in maternal creatinine clearance, maternal incidence of pulmonary edema during treatment and the period of time between treatment and delivery. In an effort to accelerate enrollment, we intend to increase the number of trial sites, including potentially initiating sites outside of the U.S., and are targeting to complete enrollment of the Phase 2b/3a study by the end of 2019.
Preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is a multi-system disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and baby. Preeclampsia is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and typically develops in women after 20 weeks of pregnancy and is characterized by elevated blood pressure, as well as vascular abnormalities, that can lead to end organ damage, intrauterine growth restriction and premature delivery. Premature delivery can lead to a number of serious health consequences for the infant, including intraventricular hemorrhage or necrotizing enterocolitis. Approximately 140,000 pregnant women in the U.S. are affected by preeclampsia, with approximately 50,000 impacted by severe preeclampsia, a more serious form of the condition that can be life threatening to both the mother and the baby. Severe preeclampsia can result in acute, as well as long-term, complications and a progressive deterioration in the clinical presentation for both the mother and the baby. There are currently no effective or FDA-approved treatments that address the underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia or severe preeclampsia. The management of severe preeclampsia is focused on medications to address the symptoms, such as antihypertensives for the urgent control of severe hypertension and magnesium sulfate for the prevention of seizures as well as early delivery of the baby.

Ciraparantag 
In January 2019, we acquired Perosphere, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing ciraparantag, a small molecule anticoagulant reversal agent in development as a single dose solution that is delivered intravenously to reverse the effects of certain NOACs (Xarelto®(rivaroxaban), Eliquis®(apixaban), and Savaysa®(edoxaban), as well as Lovenox® (enoxaparin sodium injection), a LMWH), when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these products is needed for emergency surgery, urgent procedures or due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Ciraparantag has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA and we intend to seek orphan drug designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2019.
Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was the first FDA-approved oral anticoagulant and for over 60 years was the only oral anticoagulant used in the U.S. Although warfarin is effective in the prevention of thromboembolism, its use necessitates frequent blood monitoring, dose adjustments and dietary restrictions. The first FDA-approved NOAC was Pradaxa®(dabigatran), which was introduced to the U.S. market in 2010. Since then Xarelto®, Eliquis® and Savaysa® were approved by the FDA as an alternative mechanism of action to warfarin in inhibiting the body’s ability to form blood clots. These NOACs offer similar efficacy to warfarin in reducing thromboembolism but are notably safer with respect to serious bleeding events and do not require monitoring for effectiveness. 
The use of NOAC therapy represents the fastest-growing segment of the anticoagulant market in the U.S. with approximately six million patients in the U.S. and nine million patients in certain ex-U.S. countries currently on NOAC and LMWH therapy. In January 2019, the American Heart Association released updated guidelines recommending the use of NOACs over warfarin in the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant treatment, particularly for those patients coming in for emergency surgery or other urgent procedures. Approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of patients on NOACs are at risk for serious bleeding complications each year. Prior to 2015, there were no FDA-approved reversal agents for these anticoagulants. Currently, Praxbind®(idarucizumab) is approved for the reversal of Pradaxa® and AndexXa® (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo) is approved for the reversal of Eliquis® and Xarelto® and is also in development for the reversal of Savaysa® and Lovenox®.
Ciraparantag has been evaluated in more than 250 healthy volunteers across seven clinical trials. A first in human Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects of ciraparantag alone and following a single dose of Savaysa®, and another Phase 1 study evaluated the overall metabolism of the drug. Two Phase 1/2 studies evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic effects related to the reversal of unfractionated heparin and Lovenox® and three Phase 2b randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging studies evaluated the reversal of Savaysa®, Eliquis®, and Xarelto® to assess the safety and efficacy of ciraparantag, each of which included 12 subjects dosed with ciraparantag. The Phase 2b studies to reverse Xarelto® and Eliquis® are currently ongoing; however, both studies are approximately two-thirds complete, with the low dose cohort expected to finish in the first half of 2019. In these Phase 2b clinical trials, ciraparantag or placebo was administered to healthy volunteers in a blinded fashion after achieving steady blood concentrations of the respective anticoagulant. Pharmacodynamic assessments of whole blood clotting time (“WBCT”), an important laboratory measure of clotting capacity, were sampled frequently for the first hour post study drug dose, and then periodically thereafter out to 24 hours post administration of study drug. Key endpoints in the Phase 2 trials included mean change from baseline in WBCT and the proportion of subjects that returned to within 10% of their baseline WBCT. Subjects in these studies experienced a rapid and statistically significant (p<0.001) reduction in WBCT compared to placebo as early as 15 minutes after the administration of ciraparantag in each of the four studies and the effect was sustained for 24 hours. Moreover, in both the Eliquis® and Xarelto® studies, 100% of subjects in the highest dose cohorts (180 mg of ciraparantag) were responders, as defined by a return to within 10% of baseline WBCT within 30 minutes and sustained for at least six hours. Ciraparantag has been well tolerated in clinical trials, with the most common related adverse events to date being mild sensations of coolness, warmth or tingling, skin flushing, and alterations in taste. There have been no drug-related serious adverse events to date.
Following the completion of the Phase 2b studies, we plan to conduct an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to confirm the design of our Phase 3a trials in healthy volunteers, designed to determine the lowest effective dose of ciraparantag. We expect the Phase 3a program will include one Phase 3a trial for each of the four anticoagulants under investigation for ciraparantag reversal in which healthy volunteers will be brought to steady state on each of the anticoagulant (Xarelto®, Savaysa®, Eliquis®, and Lovenox®), and then administered ciraparantag. We expect the effects will be measured frequently by measuring WBCT using an automated coagulometer. The primary endpoint for the study is expected to be the proportion of subjects who return to within 10% of their baseline WBCT as well as safety outcomes. We intend to initiate the Phase 3a trials in the second half of 2019.
9

The Phase 3a trials are expected to be followed by a Phase 3b/4 trial in patients who are currently taking Eliquis®, Xarelto®, Savaysa® or Lovenox® and experience life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding or require an urgent procedure or surgery that necessitates rapid reversal of their anticoagulant. This trial is expected to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ciraparantag in the target patient population focusing on the proportion of patients returning to normal WBCT and have evidence of hemostasis as determined by an adjudicated clinical evaluation. Based on previous precedent, we expect the trial to be an open label study with approximately 250 patients and believe that only a portion of the patients in the Phase 3b/4 trial will be required to complete the study at the time of our NDA submission. It is expected that the remainder of the study will be completed as a post-marketing commitment.

In addition, we have contracted with Perosphere Technologies Inc. (“Perosphere Technologies”), an independent company, which is developing an automated coagulometer designed to rapidly and accurately measure WBCT. Due to the variability of measuring WBCT manually, the coagulometer will be used in our Phase 3a and 3b/4 trials to measure WBCT, which is being used as a surrogate marker to demonstrate reversal of anticoagulation following ciraparantag administration. Prior to its use in our Phase 3a trial, Perosphere Technologies will be required to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) approval for its coagulometer, which will require Perosphere Technologies to show that the device is safe and effective to use in our clinical trials.
Perosphere is a party to a clinical trial collaboration agreement with a global pharmaceutical company under which Perosphere agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize ciraparantag for use as an anticoagulant reversal agent to reverse the effects of Savaysa®(edoxaban) and LMWH in the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”). Pursuant to this agreement, we have established a joint study management team to oversee studies and regulatory activities under the agreement and we are entitled to receive research and development milestone payments, anticipated in 2019 and 2020, if we complete certain clinical trial deliverables and for so long as we do not prioritize other specified development programs, or otherwise delay or hinder our efforts with Savaysa®. While this pharmaceutical company does not have any current commercial rights to ciraparantag, at its request, we are required to negotiate in good faith for the U.S. or EU. commercialization rights for ciraparantag if we have not otherwise entered into a licensing agreement or other arrangement. 
MuGard
MuGard is indicated for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including certain ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces. We acquired the U.S. commercial rights to MuGard under a June 2013 license agreement with Abeona (the “MuGard Rights”). MuGard was launched in the U.S. by Abeona in 2010 after receiving 510(k) clearance from the FDA. 
Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements
Our commercial strategy includes expanding our portfolio through the in-license or acquisition of additional pharmaceutical products or companies, including revenue-generating commercial products and assets in various stages of development. We are currently a party to the following collaborations and other arrangements: 
Endoceutics 
In February 2017, we entered into the Endoceutics License Agreement with Endoceutics to obtain an exclusive right to commercialize Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and FSD in the U.S. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote and otherwise commercialize Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and, if approved, FSD in the U.S. Endoceutics has the right to directly conduct additional commercialization activities for Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and FSD in the U.S. and has the right to conduct activities related generally to the field of intracrinology, in each case, subject to our review and approval and our right to withhold approval in certain instances. Each party’s commercialization activities and budget are described in a commercialization plan, which is updated annually. 
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $50.0 million and issued 600,000 shares of unregistered common stock to Endoceutics, which had a value of $13.5 million, as measured on April 3, 2017, the date of closing. In addition, we paid Endoceutics $10.0 million in 2017 upon the delivery by Endoceutics of Intrarosa launch quantities and $10.0 million in 2018 following the first anniversary of the closing. Endoceutics is also eligible to receive certain sales milestone payments, including a first sales milestone payment of $15.0 million, which would be triggered when annual net U.S. sales of Intrarosa exceed $150.0 million, and a second milestone payment of $30.0 million, which would be triggered when annual net U.S. sales of Intrarosa exceed $300.0 million. If annual net U.S. sales of Intrarosa exceed $500.0 million, there are additional sales milestone payments totaling up to $850.0 million, which would be triggered at various sales thresholds. In 
10

addition, we pay tiered royalties to Endoceutics equal to a percentage of net sales of Intrarosa in the U.S. ranging from mid-teens for calendar year net sales up to $150.0 million to mid twenty percent for any calendar year net sales that exceed $1.0 billion (such royalty rate to be dependent on the aggregate annual net sales of Intrarosa in the U.S.) for the commercial life of Intrarosa, subject to certain deductions. 
In the third quarter of 2017, Endoceutics initiated a clinical study with Intrarosa for the treatment of HSDD in post-menopausal women, which is now fully enrolled. Upon review of the full data set, it will be determined whether to continue to pursue an additional clinical trial to support an eventual filing with the FDA for an HSDD indication. We have agreed to share the direct costs related to such studies based upon a negotiated allocation with us funding up to $20.0 million, of which we have paid approximately $6.0 million.
The Endoceutics License Agreement grants us the right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing DHEA, including Intrarosa, at dosage strengths of 13 mg or less per dose and formulated for intravaginal delivery, excluding any combinations with other active pharmaceutical ingredients, in the U.S. for the treatment of VVA and FSD. Under the Endoceutics License Agreement, except for any compounds or products affecting the melanocortin receptor pathway, including without limitation, Vyleesi (collectively, “Excluded Products”), we are not permitted to research, develop, manufacture, or commercialize (a) DHEA for delivery by any route of administration anywhere in world, (b) any compound (including DHEA) or product for use in VVA anywhere in the world, or (c) commencing on the date of an approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S. and continuing for the remainder of the term of the Endoceutics License Agreement, any compound (including DHEA) for use in FSD (each, a “Competing Product”). Any compound or product for use in FSD that would be a Competing Product in the U.S. but that (a) does not contain DHEA and (b) was acquired or licensed or for which the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of such compound or product is initiated by us or our affiliates, in each case, prior to the date of an approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S., will be an Excluded Product and will not be subject to the exclusivity obligations under the Endoceutics License Agreement for the treatment of FSD, subject to certain restrictions in the Endoceutics License Agreement. These noncompete restrictions are subject to certain exclusions relating to the acquisition of competing programs. 
The Endoceutics License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated, including by either party for material breach that is uncured after a 90-day notice period (subject to certain extensions and dispute resolutions provisions). Either party may terminate under certain situations relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement for a valid business reason upon 365 days prior written notice to Endoceutics; or upon 60 days written notice in the event we reasonably determine in good faith, after due inquiry and after discussions with Endoceutics, that we cannot reasonably continue to develop or commercialize the product as a result of a safety issue regarding the use of Intrarosa. We may also terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement upon 180 days’ notice if there is a change of control of AMAG and the acquiring entity (alone or with its affiliates) is engaged in a competing program (as defined in the Endoceutics License Agreement) in the U.S. or in at least three countries within the EU. 
In April 2017, we entered into an exclusive commercial supply agreement with Endoceutics pursuant to which Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, agreed to manufacture and supply Intrarosa to us (the “Endoceutics Supply Agreement”) and is our exclusive supplier of Intrarosa in the U.S., subject to certain rights for us to manufacture and supply Intrarosa in the event of a cessation notice or supply failure (as such terms are defined in the Endoceutics Supply Agreement). Under the Endoceutics Supply Agreement, Endoceutics has agreed to maintain at all times a second source supplier for the manufacture of DHEA and the drug product and to identify, validate and transfer manufacturing intellectual property to the second source supplier by April 2019. The Endoceutics Supply Agreement will generally remain in effect until the termination of the Endoceutics License Agreement.
Palatin 
In January 2017, we entered into the Palatin License Agreement with Palatin under which we acquired (a) an exclusive license in all countries of North America (the “Palatin Territory”), with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research, develop and commercialize Vyleesi and any other products containing bremelanotide (collectively, the “Vyleesi Products”), (b) a worldwide non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to manufacture the Vyleesi Products, and (c) a non-exclusive license in all countries outside the Palatin Territory, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research and develop (but not commercialize) the Vyleesi Products. 
Under the terms of the Palatin License Agreement, we made an upfront payment to Palatin of $60.0 million in February 2017 and subject to agreed-upon deductions, we reimbursed Palatin approximately $25.0 million for reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Palatin in connection with the development and regulatory activities necessary to submit an NDA in the U.S. for Vyleesi for the treatment of acquired HSDD in pre-menopausal women. In June 2018, our NDA 
11

submission to the FDA for Vyleesi was accepted, which triggered a $20.0 million milestone payment, which we paid to Palatin in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, the Palatin License Agreement requires us to make contingent payments of (a) $60.0 million upon FDA approval of Vyleesi, and (b) up to $300.0 million of aggregate sales milestone payments upon the achievement of certain annual net sales milestones over the course of the license. The first sales milestone payment of $25.0 million will be triggered when Vyleesi annual net sales exceed $250.0 million. We are also obligated to pay Palatin tiered royalties on annual net sales in North America of the Vyleesi Products, on a product-by-product basis, in the Palatin Territory ranging from the high-single digits to the low double-digits. The royalties will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the latest to occur of (a) the earliest date on which there are no valid claims of Palatin patent rights covering such Vyleesi Product in such country, (b) the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period for such Vyleesi Product in such country and (c) ten years following the first commercial sale of such Vyleesi Product in such country. These royalties are subject to reduction in the event that: (x) we must license additional third-party intellectual property in order to develop, manufacture or commercialize a Vyleesi Product or (y) generic competition occurs with respect to a Vyleesi Product in a given country, subject to an aggregate cap on such deductions of royalties otherwise payable to Palatin. After the expiration of the applicable royalties for any Vyleesi Product in a given country, the license for such Vyleesi Product in such country would become a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license.
The Palatin License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Palatin License Agreement without cause, in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon at least 180 days’ prior written notice to Palatin. Either party may terminate the Palatin License Agreement for cause if the other party materially breaches or defaults in the performance of its obligations, and, if curable, such material breach remains uncured for 90 days.
Velo
In September 2018, we exercised our option to acquire the global rights to AMAG-423 pursuant to an option agreement entered into in July 2015 with Velo, the terms of which were amended at the time of exercise. In connection with the exercise of the option and consummation of the acquisition, we have assumed responsibility to complete the Phase 2b/3a clinical study that Velo initiated in the second quarter of 2017 and will incur all of the clinical, regulatory and other costs required to pursue FDA approval. As part of the acquisition, in September 2018 we paid Velo an upfront option exercise fee of $12.5 million. We are obligated to pay Velo a $30.0 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of AMAG-423. In addition, we are obligated to pay sales milestone payments to Velo of up to $240.0 million in the aggregate, triggered at various annual net sales thresholds between $300.0 million and $900.0 million and low-single digit royalties based on net sales. Further, we have assumed additional obligations under a previous agreement entered into by Velo with a third-party, including a $5.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval and $10.0 million following the first commercial sale of AMAG-423, payable in quarterly installments as a percentage of quarterly gross commercial sales until the obligation is met. We are also obligated to pay the third-party low-single digit royalties based on net sales. 
Perosphere
On January 16, 2019, we acquired Perosphere, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing ciraparantag, a small molecule anticoagulant reversal agent. Pursuant to the Perosphere Agreement, in January 2019, we paid approximately $50.0 million, subject to adjustments for working capital, cash, transaction expenses and specified indebtedness, approximately $40.0 million of which was funded from our available cash and approximately $10.0 million of which was deemed paid in connection with the cancellation of a convertible note in the principal amount of $10.0 million issued to us by Perosphere in October 2018. The purchase price is subject to customary post-closing adjustments under the Perosphere Agreement. In addition, we used available cash to repay $12.0 million of Perosphere’s term loan indebtedness and assumed approximately $6.2 million of Perosphere’s other liabilities. We are obligated to pay future contingent consideration of up to an aggregate of $365.0 million (the “Milestone Payments”), including (a) up to an aggregate of $140.0 million that becomes payable upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones for ciraparantag (the “Regulatory Milestone Payments”), including a $40.0 million milestone payment upon approval of ciraparantag by the European Medicines Agency and (b) up to an aggregate of $225.0 million that becomes payable conditioned upon the achievement of specified sales milestones (the “Sales Milestone Payments”). If the final label approved for ciraparantag in the U.S. includes a boxed warning, the Regulatory Milestone Payments shall no longer be payable, and any previously paid Regulatory Milestone Payments shall be credited against 50% of any future Milestone Payments that otherwise becomes payable. The first Sales Milestone Payment of $20.0 million will be payable upon annual net sales of ciraparantag of at least $100.0 million. Additional details regarding the Perosphere Agreement can be found in Note W, “Subsequent Events,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form-10-K.

Prasco
In December 2017, we entered into a Distribution and Supply Agreement (the “Prasco Agreement”) with Prasco, under which Prasco was granted an exclusive, non-sublicensable, nontranferable license to purchase, distribute and sell a generic version of Makena in the U.S. In July 2018, Prasco launched the Makena authorized generic of both the single-dose and multi-dose intramuscular injections. Under the Prasco Agreement, we are responsible for the manufacture and supply of the Makena authorized generic to be sold to Prasco at a predetermined supply price. Prasco is also required to pay us a certain percentage of the net distributable profits from the sale of the Makena authorized generic. Pursuant to the terms of the Prasco Agreement, in certain circumstances we have reimbursed and may be required to reimburse additional charges incurred by Prasco if we are unable to supply a certain percentage of product ordered by Prasco in a prespecified timeframe. The Prasco Agreement expires on July 2, 2022, which term will be automatically extended thereafter for additional one year periods, unless canceled by us or Prasco within an agreed-upon notice period. The Prasco Agreement is subject to early termination by us for convenience after a certain period of time or if Prasco is subject to a change of control or by either party for, among other things, uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party, lack of commercial viability or FDA notice, or by mutual agreement.
Antares
In connection with a development and license agreement (the “Antares License Agreement”) with Antares we have an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to develop, use, sell, offer for sale and import and export the Makena auto-injector. Under the terms of the Antares License Agreement, as amended in March 2018, we are responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications in each country where we desire to market and sell the Makena auto-injector, including the U.S. We are required to pay royalties to Antares on net sales of the Makena auto-injector for the Antares Royalty Term. The royalty rates range from high single digit to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales of the Makena auto-injector and decrease after the expiration of licensed patents or where there are generic equivalents to the Makena auto-injector being sold in a particular country. In addition, we are required to pay Antares sales milestone payments upon the achievement of certain annual net sales. The Antares License Agreement terminates at the end of the Antares Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party. See below under “Manufacturing” for a description of the manufacturing agreement entered into with Antares in March 2018.
Abeona
In June 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the “MuGard License Agreement”) with Abeona under which Abeona granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to use, import, offer for sale, sell, manufacture and commercialize MuGard in the U.S. and its territories and possessions (the “MuGard Territory”) for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including certain ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces.
In consideration for the license, we paid Abeona an upfront license fee of $3.3 million in June 2013. We are required to pay royalties to Abeona on net sales of MuGard in the MuGard Territory until the later of (a) the expiration of the licensed patents or (b) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of MuGard in the MuGard Territory (the “MuGard Royalty Term”). These tiered, double-digit royalty rates decrease after the expiration of the licensed patents. After the expiration of the MuGard Royalty Term, the license shall become a fully paid-up, royalty-free and perpetual license in the MuGard Territory. Abeona remains responsible for the manufacture of MuGard and we have entered into a quality agreement and a supply agreement under which we purchase MuGard inventory from them. Abeona is responsible for maintenance of the licensed patents at its own expense, and we retain the first right to enforce any licensed patent against third-party infringement. The MuGard License Agreement terminates at the end of the MuGard Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party.
Manufacturing 
Overview
We do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our commercially distributed products or for our product candidates. We rely solely on third-party contract manufacturers and our licensors (who, in turn, may also rely on third-party contract manufacturers) to manufacture our products for our commercial and clinical use. Our third-party drug product contract manufacturing facilities, and those of our licensors, are subject to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) and 
13

regulations enforced by the FDA through periodic inspections to confirm such compliance. We target to maintain, where possible, second source suppliers and/or sufficient inventory levels throughout our supply chain to meet our projected near-term demand for all of our products in order to minimize risks of supply disruption. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct more of our financial resources to the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates. 
To support the commercialization and development of our products, we have developed a fully integrated manufacturing support system, including quality assurance, quality control, regulatory affairs and inventory control policies and procedures. These support systems are intended to enable us to maintain high standards of quality for our products.
In connection with the acquisition of Perosphere, we assumed the lease on a development facility, which is not currently being utilized.
Feraheme
We are party to a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (“SAFC”) pursuant to which SAFC agreed to manufacture and we agreed to purchase the API for use in the finished drug product of ferumoxytol for commercial sale as well as for use in clinical trials (as amended, the “SAFC Agreement”). Subject to certain conditions, the SAFC Agreement provides that we purchase all of our API from SAFC. The SAFC Agreement has an initial term that ends December 31, 2020, which may be automatically extended thereafter for additional two year periods, unless canceled by us or SAFC within an agreed-upon notice period.
We are party to a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Patheon, Inc. (“Patheon”) pursuant to which Patheon agreed to manufacture ferumoxytol finished drug product for commercial sale and for use in clinical trials (as amended, the “Patheon Agreement”). The Patheon Agreement will continue in force until December 31, 2020. The Patheon Agreement may be terminated at any time upon mutual written agreement by us and Patheon or at any time by us subject to certain notice requirements and early termination fees. In addition, the Patheon Agreement may be terminated by either us or Patheon in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party provided that the breaching party fails to cure such breach within an agreed-upon notice period. 
We have also entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a second source supplier to produce ferumoxytol finished drug product in addition to Patheon, which second source supplier was approved by the FDA in 2019.
Makena 
The Makena drug product for our commercial and clinical use is currently manufactured by Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) (McPherson facility, formerly Hospira, Inc.) under a Development and Supply Agreement (as amended and restated, the “Pfizer Agreement”). The Pfizer Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements and expires on December 31, 2022, which term will be automatically extended thereafter for additional 18 month periods, unless canceled by us or Pfizer within an agreed-upon notice period. Due to continued manufacturing issues at the Pfizer McPherson manufacturing facility, we are currently experiencing a supply disruption of our Makena IM products, which has resulted in both our single-dose and multi-dose branded Makena vials being out-of-stock, as well as periodic supply disruptions and loss of market share for the authorized generic. We also have an agreement with a second source manufacturer for the Makena 1 mL drug product with Piramal Pharma Solutions (formerly Coldstream Laboratories, Inc.).
In June 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with SAFC, Inc. (“SAFC Makena”) to supply us with API for use in the finished Makena product (the “SAFC Makena Agreement”). The SAFC Makena Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements, but we are not obligated to use SAFC Makena as our sole supplier of Makena API. The SAFC Makena Agreement expires on June 4, 2021, which term will be automatically extended thereafter for additional two year periods, unless canceled by us or SAFC Makena within an agreed-upon notice period. The SAFC Makena Agreement may be terminated by either us or SAFC Makena in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party provided that the breaching party fails to cure such breach within an agreed-upon notice period or insolvency by either party. 
In June 2017, we entered into a product supply agreement with Pfizer (Kalamazoo facility) to supply us with the API for use in the finished Makena product (the “Pfizer API Agreement”). The Pfizer API Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements. The Pfizer API Agreement expires on June 1, 2020, which term will be automatically extended thereafter for additional one year periods, unless canceled by us or Pfizer within an agreed-upon notice period. The 
14

Pfizer API Agreement may be terminated by either us or Pfizer in the event of an uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party. 
Antares is the exclusive supplier for the auto-injection devices needed for the Makena auto-injector. In March 2018, we entered into the Antares Manufacturing Agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Antares agreed to sell to us on an exclusive basis, and we agreed to purchase, the fully packaged Makena auto-injector for commercial distribution. Antares is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the device components and assembly of the Makena auto-injector and we are responsible for the supply of the Makena drug substance in pre-filled syringes to be used in the assembly of the finished auto-injector product. The Antares Manufacturing Agreement terminates at the expiration or earlier termination of the Antares License Agreement, but is subject to early termination by us for certain supply failure situations, and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party or our permanent cessation of commercialization of the Makena auto-injector for efficacy or safety reasons. 
In September 2018, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH (“Fresenius”) to manufacture the pre-filled syringes used in the Makena auto-injector product (the “Fresenius Agreement”). The Fresenius Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements, but we are not obligated to use Fresenius as our sole supplier of pre-filled syringes. The Fresenius Agreement will continue for a set period of time, including mutually agreed to additional renewals, but may be terminated by either us or Fresenius in the event of an uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party, by Fresenius if we undergo a change of control to a competitor of Fresenius or by us if Fresenius fails to obtain or maintain any material government licenses or approvals. 
Intrarosa
Under the terms of the Endoceutics Supply Agreement, Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, agreed to manufacture and supply Intrarosa to us and is our exclusive supplier of Intrarosa in the U.S., subject to certain rights for us to manufacture and supply Intrarosa in the event of a cessation notice or supply failure. Endoceutics is developing internal manufacturing capabilities for Intrarosa, for which it expects to obtain approval in 2019, which would give them additional manufacturing capacity. The Endoceutics Supply Agreement will generally remain in effect until the termination of the Endoceutics License Agreement. 
MuGard
Under the terms of the MuGard License Agreement, Abeona is responsible for all aspects of manufacturing MuGard. We have entered into a supply agreement with Abeona under which we purchase MuGard inventory from Abeona. Our inventory purchases are at the price actually paid by Abeona to purchase it from a third-party plus a mark-up to cover administration, handling and overhead.
Products in Development
Under the Palatin License Agreement, we assumed a long-term commercial supply agreement with Catalent Belgium S.A. for drug product manufacture and packaging services for Vyleesi. In June 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Lonza Ltd. to supply us with the API for use in the finished Vyleesi product. In addition, in December 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Ypsomed AG to supply us with the device components of the auto-injector for use in the finished Vyleesi product. All of these agreements have certain minimum purchase requirements.
We have recently entered into an exclusive agreement with Protherics UK Ltd, a subsidiary of BTG plc (“BTG”), for the manufacture of AMAG-423 drug substance for use in the AMAG-423 commercial product (the “BTG Agreement”). BTG has also agreed to supply drug product for our current ongoing clinical trial. BTG owns the rights to digoxin immune fab (ovine), the active ingredient of AMAG-423, which has been marketed in the U.S. for many years as an FDA-approved treatment for patients with life-threatening or potentially life-threatening digoxin toxicity or overdose. Under the terms of the BTG Agreement, we are required to differentiate our product from their product, DigiFab®, including without limitation, via labeling, dosage and/or formulation and if we are unable to show differentiation, we may be in breach of the agreement and be subject to penalties. In addition, the BTG Agreement provides that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements. We will need to enter into an additional agreement to manufacture AMAG-423 drug product, especially if it is approved and we need to meet commercial demand. 
We have also assumed a commercial supply agreement with PolyPeptide Group for the supply of ciraparantag drug substance. We will need to enter into an additional agreement to manufacture ciraparantag drug product, especially if it is approved and we need to meet commercial demand.

Raw Materials
We, our licensors and our respective third-party manufacturers currently purchase certain raw and other materials used to manufacture our products from third-party suppliers and, at present, do not have long-term supply contracts with most of these third parties. Although certain of our raw or other materials are readily available, others may be obtained only from qualified suppliers. The qualification of an alternative source may require repeated testing of the new materials and generate greater expenses to us or our licensors if materials that we test do not perform in an acceptable manner. In addition, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers sometimes obtain raw or other materials from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers, which could make us susceptible to price inflation by the sole supplier, thereby increasing our production costs. As a result of the high-quality standards imposed on our raw or other materials, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers may not be able to obtain such materials of the quality required to manufacture our products from an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or in a timely manner, if at all. 
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
We consider the protection of our technology to be material to our business. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for our products and product candidates. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, collaborators and other business partners to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and ensure trade secret protection. We must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties or allowing third parties to infringe our rights. Our policy is to aggressively protect our competitive technology position by a variety of means, including applying for or obtaining rights to patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries. 
One of our U.S. Feraheme patents received a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) and will expire in June 2023, and the other U.S. patents relating to Feraheme will expire in 2020. In addition, in March 2018, we and Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) entered a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to a settlement agreement that dismissed and resolved a patent infringement suit regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Sandoz. According to the terms of the settlement, if Sandoz receives FDA approval of its ANDA by a certain date, Sandoz may launch its generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances customary for settlement agreements of this nature. Sandoz will pay a royalty on the sales of its generic version of Feraheme to us until the expiration of the last Feraheme patent listed in the Orange Book. If Sandoz is unable to secure approval by such date, Sandoz will launch an authorized generic version of Feraheme supplied by us on July 15, 2022 for up to 12 months. Sandoz’s right to distribute, and our obligation to supply, the authorized generic product shall be in accordance with standard commercial terms and profit splits. 

Our U.S. patent related to the Makena auto-injector product will expire in 2036, and we have a pending patent application related to the Makena auto-injector product. In addition, we have a license to several U.S. patents and patent applications from Antares related to the Makena auto-injector device and drug-device combination with expiration dates between 2019 and 2034. Our issued patent and Antares’ eligible patents are listed in the Orange Book for the Makena auto-injector product. There are no issued patents covering the Makena IM product. 
Under the Palatin License Agreement, we have exclusive rights to a number of U.S. and foreign patents and applications related to Vyleesi that are owned by Palatin. Certain of Palatin’s patents include claims directed to the Vyleesi drug composition of matter and methods of use thereof with terms expiring in 2020, and other patents include claims directed to methods of treating FSD by subcutaneous administration of compositions that include Vyleesi with terms expiring in 2033. Any one of the issued U.S. patents may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. Whether any of these U.S. patents will be granted patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the length of any such extension cannot be determined until a product covered by such patents receives FDA approval. 
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, we received rights to U.S. patents and applications related to Intrarosa that are controlled by Endoceutics. One issued patent includes drug product claims with a term that expires in 2031. Two additional issued patents include method of use claims and pharmaceutical dosage form claims with terms that expire in 2028, either of which may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act). However, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant such an 
16

extension. 
Under the Abeona License Agreement, we have exclusive rights to two U.S. patents related to MuGard that are owned by Abeona. These Abeona patents include liquid composition claims and will expire in 2022. 
Under the terms of the Velo Agreement, we obtained four issued U.S. patents covering methods of using AMAG-423 to treat women exhibiting symptoms of preeclampsia or eclampsia, each of which expires in November 2022, and several corresponding foreign patents that expire in 2023. Digoxin immune fab (ovine), the active ingredient of AMAG-423, has been approved and marketed in the U.S. for many years for a different indication and no longer has composition of matter patent protection. Accordingly, we do not have and will not be able to obtain composition of matter patent protection for AMAG-423. AMAG-423 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and, if approved, we expect it to receive seven years of marketing exclusivity.
Additionally, under the terms of the Perosphere Agreement, we obtained two issued U.S. patents and several foreign patents related to ciraparantag. One U.S. patent includes claims directed to the ciraparantag drug composition of matter with a term that expires in 2034, and the other U.S. patent includes claims directed to methods of using ciraparantag to reverse the anticoagulation effect of certain coagulation inhibitors with a term that expires in 2032. All of the foreign patents expire in 2032. Either of the issued U.S. patents may be granted up to five years of patent term extension (up to a maximum patent term of 14 years after regulatory approval) pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. Whether either of these U.S. patents will be granted patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the length of any such extension cannot be determined until a product covered by such patents receives FDA approval.
With regard to pending patent applications we own or have rights to, even though further patents may be issued on such applications, we cannot be sure that any such patents will be issued on a timely basis, if at all, or with a scope that provides our products with additional protection. The claims of issued patents related to any of our products may not provide meaningful protection for the product, and third parties may challenge the validity or scope of any such issued patents. Additionally, the claims of our issued patents may be narrowed or invalidated by administrative proceedings, such as interference or derivation, inter partes review, post grant review or reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, existing or future patents of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products.
We also have numerous U.S. and foreign trademark registrations directed to our corporate and affiliate names, as well as our products and compliance programs. These marks help to further distinguish our products and enhance our overall intellectual property position.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our existing or potential competitors for all our products have or may develop products that are more widely accepted than ours, are viewed as more safe, effective, convenient or easier to administer, have been on the market longer and have stronger patient/provider loyalty, have been approved for a larger patient population, are less expensive or offer more attractive insurance coverage, discounts, reimbursements, incentives or rebates and may have or receive patent protection that dominates, blocks, makes obsolete or adversely affects our product development or business. 
Feraheme
Many of our competitors for Feraheme are large, well-known pharmaceutical companies and may benefit from significantly greater financial, sales and marketing capabilities, greater technological or competitive advantages, and other resources. 
Feraheme currently competes primarily with the following IV iron replacement therapies for the treatment of IDA:

• | Venofer®, an iron sucrose complex, which is approved for use in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, non-dialysis dependent CKD patients and pediatric CKD patients and is marketed in the U.S. by Fresenius Medical Care North America and American Regent, Inc. (“American Regent”), a subsidiary of Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a business unit of Daiichi Sankyo Group);


• | Injectafer®, a ferric carboxymaltose injection, which is approved to treat IDA in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron. Injectafer® is also indicated for IDA in adult patients with

17

non-dialysis dependent CKD. Injectafer® is marketed in the U.S. by American Regent, the same distributor of Venofer®; 

• | Ferrlecit®, a sodium ferric gluconate, which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, is approved for use only in hemodialysis patients;


• | A generic version of Ferrlecit® marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;


• | INFeD®, an iron dextran product marketed by Allergan, Inc. which is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral iron administration is unsatisfactory or impossible; and


• | Auryxia® (ferric citrate), an oral phosphate binder, which is marketed by Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (which recently merged with Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.), and which approved in the U.S. for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD not on dialysis.

In addition to the currently marketed products described above, in the future Feraheme may also compete with Monoferric™ (iron isomaltoside 1000 for injection) (global brand name Monofer®), which is manufactured by Pharmacosmos A/S in over 30 countries outside the U.S., including Canada. Monoferric™ is under development in the U.S. and has completed its Phase III trials in which Monofer® was administered as a single 1,000 mg dose, which, if approved, may offer an alternative for patients. In addition, there are several hypoxia inducible factor stabilizers in various stages of development to treat anemia related to CKD that could potentially compete with Feraheme in the future, a number of which are currently in Phase III trials. 
We may face challenges retaining our existing Feraheme customers, gaining sales to new customers and gaining market share despite the February 2018 approval of Feraheme’s broader label. For example, since Injectafer® was approved in 2013 with a broader indication than the original Feraheme indication, physicians may have increased their use of Injectafer® and other physicians may have begun to use Injectafer®, making it more difficult for us to cause these physicians to use Feraheme in the future. In addition, manufacturers of Injectafer® may have entered into commercial contracts with key customers or group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), which would limit our ability to enter into favorable contractual arrangements. Further, Daiichi Sankyo Group has a substantially larger sales force to market Injectafer® than we do to market Feraheme, which allows them to reach a broader group of healthcare professionals. 
Companies that manufacture generic products typically invest far fewer resources in research and development than the manufacturers of branded products and can therefore price their products significantly lower than those branded products already on the market. Therefore, competition from generic IV iron products could limit our sales. Feraheme may face future competition from generic IV iron replacement therapy products. For example, under our settlement agreement with Sandoz, if Sandoz receives FDA approval by a certain date, Sandoz may launch its generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances customary for settlement agreements of this nature. If Sandoz is unable to secure approval by such date, Sandoz may launch an authorized generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2022 for up to twelve months. 
Based on sales data provided to us by IQVIA Holdings Inc. (“IQVIA”), we estimate that the size of the total 2018 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.3 million grams, which represents an increase of approximately 8.5% over 2017. During 2017 (and until February 2018), Feraheme competed exclusively in the CKD portion of this market, which we estimate is approximately half of the total market. Based on this IQVIA data, the following represents the 2018 and 2017 U.S. market share allocation of the total non-dialysis IV iron market based on the volume of IV iron administered:
 | 2018 U.S. Non-dialysis IV Iron Market | 2017 U.S. Non-dialysis IV Iron Market
 | (1.3 million grams) | (1.2 million grams) 
Venofer® | 35% | 35% 
Injectafer® | 33% | 26% 
Feraheme | 15% | 12% 
INFeD® | 6% | 15% 
Generic sodium ferric gluconate | 9% | 9% 
Ferrlecit® | 2% | 3% 

The market share data listed in the table above is not necessarily indicative of the market shares in dollars due to the variations in selling prices among the IV iron products. 
18

Makena
Makena competition currently comes mainly from generic formulations of HPC injections as well as from pharmacies that compound a non-FDA approved version of Makena, both of which are sold at a much lower list price than our branded products. In early 2018, Makena’s exclusivity period ended and since then two generic competitors have entered the market in addition to the Makena authorized generic product, marketed by Prasco. Currently, American Regent and Slayback Pharma LLC (“Slayback”) sell generic versions of the Makena 1ml presentation and 5 ml presentations, respectively, and we expect additional generic entrants to enter the market as early as March 2019 to compete against both the 1ml and 5ml presentations. 
The long-term success of the Makena franchise is highly dependent on our ability to maintain and grow the market share for the Makena auto-injector, which was approved for commercialization in February 2018, and which is intended to provide us with an alternative treatment method to the Makena IM product. Although there is no direct competition with the Makena auto-injector, the auto-injector competes for the same patients as generic versions of the Makena IM product, including the Makena authorized generic. We may not be able to continue to convince healthcare providers to use or to switch from using the IM method of administration to the auto-injector, including if healthcare providers are hesitant or apprehensive to use an auto-injector product due to perceptions regarding lack of improvement in safety, efficacy or pain associated with the Makena auto-injector or if the auto-injector is not priced competitively or is not provided comparable insurance coverage to the Makena IM product. 
We also expect to continue to face competition for Makena from future generic products as well as products currently in development which offer additional formulations or routes of administration that doctors believe may reduce or prevent preterm birth, such as an oral HPC product, which is currently in development and has completed its End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. 
Based on IQVIA data and internal analytics, we estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Makena branded products and the Makena authorized generic made up approximately 56% and 22% of the total prescriptions written for all FDA-approved HPC products, respectively. We also estimate that the generic marketed by American Regent generated approximately 22% of the total prescriptions written for all FDA-approved HPC products in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition to FDA-approved products for the approved indication, other at-risk patients are treated with compounded formulations of HPC or other therapies, such as vaginal progesterone, that are not approved for women pregnant with a single baby with a prior history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. 
Intrarosa 
Intrarosa faces competition from the following approved products: 

• | Estrace® Cream (Estradiol vaginal cream, USP 0.01%) (“Estrace”), a vaginal cream for the treatment of VVA marketed by Allergan PLC;


• | Estradiol® Vaginal Cream USP, 0.01% (generic version of Estrace®), including a generic marketed by Mylan N.V., which was launched in December 2017, a generic marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”), which was launched in early 2018, a generic marketed by Impax Laboratories, Inc., which was launched in mid-2018, and a generic marketed by Alvogen Inc., which was launched in mid-2018;


• | Vagifem® (estradiol vaginal inserts) (“Vagifem”), a suppository marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S for the treatment of VVA;


• | Estradiol vaginal inserts USP (generic versions of Vagifem®), including Yuvafem, which is marketed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, a generic marketed by Teva and a generic marketed by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc.;


• | Premarin Vaginal Cream®, a vaginal cream for the treatment of VVA marketed by Pfizer;


• | Estring®(estradiol vaginal ring), a vaginal ring marketed by Pfizer for the treatment of VVA due to menopause;


• | Osphena®, an oral therapy marketed by Duchesnay Inc. for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause;

19


• | IMVEXXY® (estradiol vaginal inserts), an estrogen indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause, which was launched in mid-2018 and is marketed by TherapeuticsMD, Inc.; and


• | Over the counter and compounded remedies that are marketed for dyspareunia and over the counter and compounded products that contain DHEA.

The actual market size and market dynamics for moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause is uncertain. While we believe that Intrarosa, as the only FDA-approved, non-estrogen-containing vaginal insert to treat moderate to severe dyspareunia, has competitive advantages compared to estrogen-containing therapies, we may not be able to realize this perceived advantage in the market. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if physicians or patients perceive that other products are more effective, or convenient or safer than Intrarosa, or if they are less expensive than Intrarosa. 
In addition, our ability to compete may be affected by the extent and scope of third-party reimbursement for products treating dyspareunia. Some of the products that Intrarosa competes with have a broader indication for VVA and receive reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs. Although we have been able to gain coverage for Intrarosa with commercial health plans, given the increasing number of generic competitors, payers may choose to selectively implement utilization management policies on Intrarosa. Intrarosa is covered as non-preferred and is one of many drugs available. As a result, patients do not receive full reimbursement by third-party commercial payers and may not receive any reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs. Many patients are therefore subject to substantial out-of-pocket costs. 
In May 2018, Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued guidelines clarifying the statutory intent of its prior policy to state that drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause are not excluded from Medicare Part D coverage when used consistent with this labeling. Medicare formularies are highly cost sensitive, have long decision cycles, and tend to be limited in the number of products that are offered. Therefore, Medicare coverage for Intrarosa may continue to be limited. Less than full reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers may adversely affect the market acceptance of Intrarosa and put it at a competitive disadvantage to some of the competing products, including generic versions of estrogens and compounded products, which are often priced lower than branded products.
MuGard 
There are currently few effective treatments for the treatment or management of oral mucositis. The market for treating oral mucositis is driven primarily by convenience, price and reimbursement and the products in this market remain mostly undifferentiated. There are a number of approaches used to treat or manage oral mucositis that compete with MuGard, including the use of ice chips during chemotherapy treatments, various medicinal mouthwashes, topical anesthetics and analgesics, and oral gel treatments. For example, many physicians use what is commonly known as “magic mouthwash”, which may currently be the most commonly prescribed medication to manage oral mucositis. Magic mouthwash is a combination of generic ingredients which are typically compounded in a pharmacy and is preferred by many physicians because of the availability of less expensive generic ingredients used to formulate the mouthwash. 
Vyleesi
If Vyleesi is approved for marketing by the FDA and if we are successful in launching and commercializing it, we expect Vyleesi will face competition. Addyi® (flibanserin) was introduced into the market in October 2015 for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women and is marketed by Sprout2 Inc. (“Sprout”). Addyi® is only available through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) program because of an increased risk of severe hypotension and syncope due to the interaction between Addyi® and alcohol. In addition, Addyi® was approved with a boxed warning to highlight the risks of severe hypotension and syncope in patients who drink alcohol during treatment with Addyi®, in patients who use Addyi® with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or in patients who have liver impairment. 
We are not aware of any company actively developing another melanocortin receptor agonist drug for the treatment of HSDD. However, we are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are being developed to be taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. Emotional Brain BV, a Netherlands company, is developing two different oral fixed-dose, on-demand combination drugs, one a combination of sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra) and testosterone and the other a combination of testosterone and buspirone hydrochloride, and has conducted Phase 2b studies. There may be other companies developing new drugs for FSD indications, some of which may be in clinical trials in the U.S. or elsewhere, or other companies which may sell their products off-label for indications other than FSD. 
While we believe that Vyleesi will have competitive advantages for treating HSDD, such as on demand use and length of the therapeutic effect compared to chronic or daily use hormones and other drugs, we may not be able to realize these perceived 
20

advantages in the market, in part because Vyleesi is administered by subcutaneous auto-injection. While the single-use, disposable auto-injector format is designed to maximize market acceptability, apprehension associated with an injectable drug or certain side effects that were observed in the Phase 3 studies, such as nausea, may impact Vyleesi’s ability to achieve significant market acceptance, especially if an oral therapy is available as an alternative.
Ciraparantag
Currently, we expect ciraparantag, if approved, will compete primarily with AndexXa® (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo) (“Andexxa”), which was approved in 2018 for the reversal of Eliquis® and Xarelto® for patients treated with Eliquis® and Xarelto®, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. AndexXa® is also in development for the reversal of Savaysa® and Lovenox®. We are seeking approval of ciraparantag to reverse the effects of Eliquis®, Xarelto®, Savaysa® and Lovenox®. Based on clinical data to date, we expect that ciraparantag will be a ready-to-use product with the potential to be stored at room temperature and to be effective at a fixed dose for the NOACs and LMWH being studied. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Women’s and Maternal Health Products
Following our February 2019 combination of our women's and maternal health sales forces, we will have one integrated sales team, which will now promote Intrarosa, Makena and Vyleesi, if approved, in order to provide healthcare professionals with one commercial point of contact and seeks to maximize efficiency and effectiveness for the promotion of our commercial products. We expect this unified sales force to call on approximately 17,000 obstetricians and gynecologists and other prescribers. 
Makena
Makena prescriptions are dispensed via the payer-preferred pharmacy or purchased directly by hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery networks. Our sales and marketing teams use a variety of strategies and focused, multi-channel methods to promote Makena, including dedicating a managed care team to focus on health plans, including commercial payers, pharmacy benefit managers, and managed Medicaid plans as well as fee-for-service Medicaid programs. In addition, we have partnered with a leading provider of home nursing services (which had previously utilized compounded HPC) pursuant to which the provider performs at-home administration of Makena and co-promotes Makena to certain healthcare providers. 
In addition, we offer customer support through the Makena Care Connection, which is designed to help the prescriber and patient navigate each individual patient’s needs throughout the Makena prescription process, including confirming insurance coverage, providing education and support on prior authorizations (when applicable), and working in collaboration with a payer-preferred pharmacy and home health agency to help ensure timely initiation of therapy. The Makena Care Connection also screens eligible patients for and enrolls eligible patients in financial assistance programs including (a) our copay savings program, which helps lower the out-of-pocket cost for commercially insured patients whose plan covers Makena, and (b) our patient assistance program, which provides a full course of therapy at no cost to eligible uninsured and commercially underinsured patients. Additionally, the Makena Care Connection offers education and adherence support to eligible patients to assist with increasing patient compliance by encouraging adherence to the weekly Makena injection schedule. 
Prasco has an exclusive license to purchase, distribute and sell the Makena authorized generic and has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, distribute and sell the Makena authorized generic during the term of the agreement. 
Intrarosa 
In July 2017, Intrarosa became available for healthcare provider prescribing and can be ordered through wholesalers and retail pharmacies. As part of our continued launch strategy, and critical to the commercial success of Intrarosa, we are executing an integrated marketing plan designed to drive awareness of dyspareunia and the potential benefits of Intrarosa to increase the likelihood that healthcare providers and patients will view Intrarosa as an accessible and viable treatment option. Despite significant marketing and educational efforts by industry participants intended to spread awareness of the condition and its treatment, studies suggest that women often do not recognize dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, as a treatable medical condition and are often not aware of treatment options. We have and plan to continue to undertake informational and educational programs such as speaker programs to help spread awareness of dyspareunia and VVA and the benefits of Intrarosa for the conditions indicated. In addition, we have implemented a sampling program, which makes samples of Intrarosa available to healthcare providers through our sales representatives or via our website to areas where we do not have sales representatives. 
21

We also currently offer a comprehensive copay savings program to patients and have implemented patient-specific marketing programs around the condition of dyspareunia and Intrarosa utilizing digital marketing, print and social media platforms. 
Vyleesi
If Vyleesi is approved by the FDA, we expect that it will be distributed nationally through select specialty pharmacies. The initial focus of our Vyleesi commercialization efforts will be to continue to raise awareness and education about HSDD for both healthcare professionals and patients with this disorder, such as our 2018 unbranded condition awareness to healthcare professionals. Additionally, our launch strategy will focus on establishing Vyleesi as the preferred option for women and healthcare providers seeking a treatment for HSDD through media such as direct-to-consumer marketing in lifestyle and social media channels. We also intend to focus our Vyleesi marketing efforts, if approved, towards healthcare professionals, who we expect will play a significant role in increasing HSDD and Vyleesi awareness among their patients, primarily by leveraging our newly combined women’s health sales force and through digital media. In order to minimize cost and injection barriers to treatment, we anticipate implementing a competitive copay savings program and injection training to healthcare professionals upon commercial launch of Vyleesi. 
Hematology/Oncology Products
Feraheme
We sell Feraheme to authorized wholesalers and specialty distributors who, in turn, sell Feraheme to healthcare providers who administer Feraheme primarily within hospitals and hematology and oncology clinics. Since many hospitals and hematology and oncology practices are members of GPOs, which leverage the purchasing power of a group of entities to obtain discounts based on the collective bargaining power of the group, we also routinely enter into pricing agreements with GPOs in these markets so the members of the GPOs have access to Feraheme and to the related discounts or rebates. 
Our sales and marketing organization uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote Feraheme, including sales calls to purchasing entities, such as hospitals and hematology and oncology clinics, in addition to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals, medical education symposia, promotional materials, local and national educational programs, and scientific meetings and conferences. In addition, through AMAG Assist®, we provide customer service and other related programs for Feraheme, including prescription coverage information support services, a patient assistance program for eligible uninsured or functionally under-insured patients and a customer service call center. 
The label expansion for Feraheme to include all eligible IDA patients in the U.S. doubled the size of the addressable patient population for Feraheme, which has allowed for increased penetration in existing accounts and has broadened the number of customers utilizing Feraheme within the IV iron marketplace. Additionally, with the expanded label, Feraheme may be promoted as an option for patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have unsatisfactory response to oral iron therapy that are in treatment settings where we already have sales teams, such as obstetricians and gynecologists in connection with AUB. We believe this segment of patients is under-diagnosed and under-treated, and there is a significant opportunity in this market to provide IV iron to such patients. Other categories of potential patients with IDA include those with inflammatory bowel disease treated by gastroenterologists. Our sales teams are working to educate healthcare providers who manage adult IDA patients to expand the IV iron use in physicians’ offices, clinics, and hospitals where eligible IDA patients are treated. 
MuGard
Our commercial team uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote MuGard, including sales calls to providing entities, such as hematology and oncology clinics and hospitals. In addition, other marketing programs may include promotional materials to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals.
We market and sell MuGard to wholesalers and specialty pharmacies. Patients primarily receive MuGard through specialty pharmacies, which receive prescriptions from physicians directly or from AMAG Assist, which acts as our MuGard patient reimbursement and support center. We utilize AMAG Assist as a centralized patient intake and referral management center to process insurance coverage issues and administer our patient assistance program. In order to make MuGard available to patients as soon as possible, we provide a starter kit to clinicians, including a sample bottle and all pertinent information that the patient or caregiver needs to immediately begin MuGard therapy.
22

Product Supply Chain
We outsource a number of our product supply chain services for our products to third-party logistics providers, including services related to warehousing and inventory management, distribution, chargeback processing, accounts receivable management, sample distribution to our sales force and customer service call center management.
Major Customers
The following table sets forth customers who represented 10% or more of our total revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016. 

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation | 27 | % | | 26 | % | 27 | %
McKesson Corporation | 26 | % | | 24 | % | 14 | %
Caremark, LLC | < 10% | | | < 10% | | 10 | %

The loss of the above customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Government Regulation 
Overview
Our activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research and development, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, recordkeeping, approval, storage, distribution, and advertising, promotion and post-approval monitoring and reporting of pharmaceutical and biological products and medical devices. 
Failure to comply with any of the applicable U.S. requirements may result in a variety of administrative or judicially imposed sanctions including, among other things, the regulatory agency’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension, variations or withdrawals of approval, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
Product Development and Approval Process
Clinical Development
Before we may market a new product, we must obtain FDA approval of an NDA for a drug product or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic, such as AMAG-423. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA if, among other requirements, the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate can be established based on the results of preclinical and clinical studies.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice regulations. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical testing. Prior to beginning a clinical trial, an IND - a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans in clinical trials - must be submitted to FDA and must become effective. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”), before any trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. Additional ongoing regulatory requirements apply throughout the course of a clinical trial, including requirements governing the reporting of certain ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical testing typically proceeds in three phases, which may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials seek to collect initial data about safety, tolerability, and optimal dosing of the investigational product in healthy human subjects or, less commonly, in patients with the target disease or condition. The goal of Phase 2 trials is to provide preliminary evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the investigational product in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects with the target disease or condition. Phase 3 trials generally consist of expanded, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, multi-center 
23

studies of the safety and efficacy of the product in the target patient population and are used as the primary basis for regulatory approval. 
Submission and FDA Review of NDAs, sNDAs and BLAs
Following the successful completion of clinical trials, the sponsor submits the results to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. The NDA or BLA must also include the results of preclinical tests and studies, as the FDA requires submission of all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as, among other required information, information related to the preparation and manufacturing of the drug or biologic candidate, analytical methods, and proposed packaging and labeling. Pursuant to agreements reached during reauthorization of PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of acting on most original NDAs within six months or ten months of the application submission or filing date (the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing), depending on the nature of the drug. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing (60 days post receipt of the application by the FDA, if at all), the FDA typically takes ten months to review the application and respond to the applicant. The review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA or BLA and of the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter, and the sponsor may begin marketing the drug for the approved indications, subject to any post-approval requirements, described further below. If the FDA determines it cannot approve the NDA or BLA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter indicating that the application will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the application and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA of BLA. Addressing the deficiencies noted by the FDA could be impractical, and it is possible that the sponsor could withdraw its application or approval may not be obtained or may be costly and may result in significant delays prior to approval.
Where a sponsor wishes to expand the originally approved prescribing information, such as adding a new indication, it must submit and obtain approval of an sNDA. Changes to an indication generally require additional clinical studies, which can be time-consuming and require the expenditure of substantial additional resources. Under PDUFA, the target timeframe for the review of an sNDA to add a new clinical indication is six or ten months from the receipt date, depending on whether or not the sNDA has priority review. As with an NDA or BLA, if the FDA determines that it cannot approve an sNDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter as discussed above. 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
The FDA has a number of programs intended to help expedite testing, review, and approval of drug candidates that meet the applicable eligibility criteria such as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Designation, priority review and accelerated approval. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider review of completed sections of an NDA or BLA on a rolling basis provided the sponsor provides, and the FDA accepts, a schedule for the submission of the completed sections of the NDA or BLA. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
A drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Designation if the drug is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. Breakthrough Designation provides for frequent meetings between the sponsor and the FDA, involving senior and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-functional review and the assignment of an FDA project lead to facilitate efficient review of the development program and serve as a scientific liaison with the sponsor. 
24

A Fast Track or Breakthrough designated drug candidate may also qualify for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, under which the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA in a total of six months rather than ten months after it is accepted for filing. 
In addition, under the provisions of the FDA’s Subpart H Accelerated Approval regulations, accelerated approval may be permitted based on an appropriate surrogate endpoint for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments.
The 21st Century Cures Act 
The 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, requires the FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools that may be used to support or obtain licensure of a biological product or support of the investigational use of a biological product. A drug development tool includes a biomarker, a clinical outcome assessment, and any other method, material, or measure that the FDA determines aids drug development and regulatory review. A biomarker is a characteristic, such as a physiologic, pathologic, or anatomic characteristic or measurement, that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic intervention and includes a surrogate endpoint. A clinical outcome assessment is a measurement of a patient’s symptoms, overall mental state, or the effects of a disease or condition on how the patient functions and includes a patient-reported outcome.
The 21st Century Cures Act also requires that, for approval of any BLAs submitted after June 12, 2017, the FDA shall make public a brief statement regarding the patient experience data and related information, if any, submitted and reviewed as part of the application. Patient experience data includes data that are collected by any persons, including patients, family members and caregivers of patients, patient advocacy organizations, disease research foundations, researchers and drug manufacturers, and are intended to provide information about patients’ experiences with a disease or condition, including the impact of such disease or condition, or a related therapy, on patients’ lives and patient preferences with respect to treatment of such disease or condition.
Abbreviated New Drug Application
The Hatch-Waxman Act created the ANDA pathway, which allows companies to seek approval for generic versions of brand-name drugs previously approved under an NDA and listed in the Orange Book. Rather than directly demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy, as is required of an NDA, an ANDA must show that the proposed generic product is the same as the previously approved product in terms of active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form and route of administration. In addition, with certain exceptions, the generic product must have the same labeling as the product to which it refers. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved product if, in relevant part, “the rate and extent of absorption of the [generic] drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
NDA applicants and holders must provide certain information about patents related to the branded drug for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the branded product that is the reference listed drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send appropriate notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within 20 days of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application (a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted) being accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of expiration of the patent, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant, or 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice (which can be extended if the reference product has 5-year exclusivity and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted between four and five years after approval of the reference product).
The Hatch-Watchman Act also provides for a 180-day period of generic product exclusivity for the first generic applicant to submit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification for a generic version of an NDA-approved drug. Generic pharmaceutical products that are introduced by innovator companies, either directly or through partnering arrangements with other generic companies are known as authorized generics. Authorized generics are equivalent to the innovator companies' brand name drugs but are sold at relatively lower prices than the brand name drugs. An authorized generic product may be marketed during the 
25

180-day exclusivity period granted to the first manufacturer to submit an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification for a generic version of the brand product.
Adverse Event Reporting
The FDA requires a sponsor to submit reports of certain information on side effects and adverse events associated with its products that occur either during clinical trials or after marketing approval. These requirements include specific and timely notification of certain serious, unexpected and/or frequent adverse events, as well as regular periodic reports summarizing adverse drug experiences. Failure to comply with these FDA safety reporting requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may include civil action or criminal penalties. In addition, as a result of these reports, the FDA could create a Tracked Safety Issue for a product in the FDA’s Document Archiving, Reporting and Regulatory Tracking System, place additional limitations on an approved product’s use, such as through labeling changes, or, potentially, could require withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, FDA could require post-approval studies or impose distribution and use restrictions and other requirements via a REMS based upon new safety information obtained through adverse event reporting (discussed further below).
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Even if initial approval of an NDA, sNDA or BLA is granted, such approval may be subject to post-approval regulatory requirements, any or all of which may adversely impact a sponsor’s ability to effectively market and sell the approved product. The FDA may require the sponsor to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials, also known as post-marketing requirements, to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. In addition, the FDA and the sponsor may agree to the conduct of certain post-market studies, known as post-marketing commitments, to further obtain safety and efficacy information. The results of such post-marketing requirement or commitment studies may be negative and could lead to limitations on the further marketing of a product, including safety labeling changes. Also, under PREA, the FDA may require pediatric assessment of certain drugs unless waived or deferred due to the fact that necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical to conduct in the specified age group or where the drug is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to implement a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with the product. Failure to comply with REMS requirements may result in civil penalties. Further, if an approved product encounters any safety or efficacy issues, including drug interaction problems, the FDA has broad authority to require the sponsor to take any number of actions, including, but not limited to, undertaking post-approval clinical studies, implementing labeling changes, adopting a REMS, issuing Dear Health Care Provider letters, or removing the product from the market.
FDA Regulation of our Products 
FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion
The FDA also regulates all advertising and promotional activities for prescription drugs, both prior to and after approval. Approved pharmaceutical products must be promoted in a manner consistent with their terms and conditions of approval, including the scope of their approved use. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (“off-label promotion”) or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to, among other things, adverse publicity, product seizures, civil or criminal penalties, or regulatory letters, which may include warnings and require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals.
Promotional labeling and advertising materials for all prescription pharmaceutical products must be submitted to the FDA’s Office of Promotional Drug Products (“OPDP”) at the time of initial dissemination or publication. However, under the Subpart H regulations, until the Makena confirmatory post-approval clinical trial is completed, we are subject to the requirement that all Makena promotional materials be submitted for review to the OPDP at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the promotional labeling or initial publication of the advertisement. This extra requirement means that there is a longer lead time before we are able to introduce new promotional material to the market for Makena and we are subject to increased scrutiny prior to using promotional pieces to ensure fair balance.
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Facilities 
Manufacturing procedures and quality control for approved drugs must conform to cGMP. Domestic manufacturing establishments must follow cGMP at all times, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. In addition, prior to approval of an NDA, sNDA or BLA, the FDA will often perform a pre-
26

approval inspection of the sponsor’s manufacturing facility, including its equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes, to determine the facility’s compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. Vendors that supply finished products or components to the sponsor that are used to manufacture, package, and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections. If the FDA identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter should be issued for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may result in agency consideration of an enforcement action. 
Product approval may be delayed or denied due to cGMP non-compliance or other issues at the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities or contractor sites or suppliers included in the NDA, sNDA or BLA, and the complete resolution of these inspectional findings may be beyond the sponsor’s control. If the FDA determines that the sponsor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the sponsor, including suspension of its manufacturing operations.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient population of fewer than 200,000. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period, except in very limited circumstances. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for an approved indication if that indication is for the treatment of a condition broader than that for which it received orphan drug designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Finally, the FDA may approve a subsequent drug that is otherwise the same as a currently approved orphan drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period if the sponsor of the subsequent drug can demonstrate that the drug is clinically superior to the already approved drug. According to the FDA, clinical superiority may be demonstrated by showing that a drug is more effective in a clinical trial, safer in a substantial portion of the target population, or provides a major contribution to patient care relative to the currently approved drug. 
Fraud and Abuse Regulation
Our general operations, and the research, development, manufacture, sale, and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including, but not limited to, FDA regulations, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and their state analogues, and similar laws in countries outside of the U.S., laws governing sampling and distribution of products and government price reporting laws.

• | The AKS makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or to intended to induce, purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the purchase or order of any item or service, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program. Liability may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, federal law now provides that the government may assert that a claim including items resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA, described below. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have enacted similar anti-kickback laws, including in laws that prohibit paying or receiving remuneration to induce a referral or recommendation of an item or service reimbursed by any payer, including private payers.


• | The FCA imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement of drugs for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The FCA also prohibits knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or having possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the federal government and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered, less than all of that money or property. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent

27

claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. The FCA permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring an action on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for, among other things, claims for items not provided as claimed or for medically unnecessary items, kickbacks, promotion of off-label uses, and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies. Many states have enacted similar false claims laws, including in some cases laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer, not just government programs.

• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “ACA”), which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Many states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state and make periodic public disclosure on sales and marketing activities and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws, we could be subject to state and federal penalty provisions.


• | The FCPA prohibits U.S. publicly-traded companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records, as well as an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we violate the FCPA, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties.

Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under the above referenced laws. Federal and state authorities continue to devote significant attention and resources to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in bringing lawsuits on behalf of the government under the FCA. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry; however, these laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws in the context of particular industry practices. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, or our contractors are or will be in compliance will all federal, state, and foreign regulations. If we or our representatives fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of fines, penalties, and/or other sanctions could be imposed on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on how we market and sell our products, significant fines, exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, litigation, or other sanctions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such investigations or suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which can also have an adverse effect on our business.
Our activities are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities including CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
28

Other Regulatory Requirements
Several states have enacted legislation requiring manufacturers operating within the state to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities. In addition, as discussed above, as part of the ACA, certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices are required to publicly report gifts and other payments or transfers of value made to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the likely extent of future enforcement for failure to comply with these requirements is unclear. Compliance with these laws is difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we may face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and we could receive adverse publicity which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are also subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. 
In addition, as discussed above, in the course of our business, we may obtain health information from third parties (i.e., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits) we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA/HITECH. We are also subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. We obtain patient health information from most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with, and they are subject to privacy and security requirements that may affect us. 
Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in the countries in which we do business relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules. The GDPR extends the geographical scope of EU data protection law to non-EU entities under certain conditions, tightens existing EU data protection principles and creates new obligations for companies and new rights for individuals. The GDPR is new and therefore guidance, interpretation and enforcement under the GDPR are still developing. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, expose us to substantial potential fines and increase our compliance costs. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. 
Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. 
29

U. S. Healthcare Reform
Our revenue and operations could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Since its enactment, however, there have been modifications and challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA. In 2019, litigation, regulation, and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing. replacing, and/or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. Individual states in the U.S. have passed legislation and implemented regulations requiring reporting related to notification of certain price increases and submissions on justifications for certain price increases. The enforcement of individual state requirements is uncertain, but failure to comply could expose us to substantial financial penalties and the potential for adverse publicity. The number of states establishing requirements to report pricing or otherwise designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing is likely to continue to increase, creating a regulatory landscape of substantial complexity. The pace of change and varying demand of individual state requirements may make it very difficult to comply.
Drug-Device Combination Regulation
Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and a device). Drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. The Makena auto-injector and the Vyleesi product, if approved, are considered drug-device combination products and are regulated under this framework. 
Medical Device Regulation
All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE, regulations that among other things, govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. The IDE application must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
Medical devices, such as MuGard, are similarly subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive post-approval regulation under the FDC Act. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as premarket notification (the “510(k) process”), requires a sponsor to obtain 510(k) clearance by demonstrating that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device that is not subject to premarket approval. The second, more rigorous process, known as premarket approval, requires a sponsor to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective.
Both before and after a device is commercially released, there are ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. For example, the FDA requires that device manufacturers maintain particular reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could, depending on the FDA’s specific findings, require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks 
30

of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products is dependent, in significant part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments is available from third-party payers, including state and federal governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations.
Coverage by third-party payers depends on a number of factors, including the third-party’s determination that the product is clinically and cost effective both individually and within its therapeutic class. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products (including combination products), and continue to institute cost containment measures to control or influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products, such as through the use of prior authorizations and step therapy. There is a continued scrutiny, intensifying criticism and political focus on pharmaceutical pricing practices at both national and regional levels. Especially in the U.S., state legislators are implementing a variety of regulations intended to increase the transparency of bio-pharmaceutical pricing, which may lead to future price control regulations at state levels. Federally, multiple price control mechanisms have been suggested in the recent past, and bi-partisan focus on the issues remains a high priority. Consolidation of pharmacy benefit managers and managed care organizations is also increasing the price pressure in the private sector. If these third-party payers provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement for our products, physicians and other healthcare providers may choose to prescribe alternative products, including generics, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program that is administered by the states for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and other individuals with disabilities. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program established by the ACA, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. The amount of the rebate is determined by law and will be adjusted upward if average manufacture price (“AMP”) increases more than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban. Each quarter, the rebate amount is calculated based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to CMS. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. Further, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective as of April 2016, require state Medicaid programs to reimburse certain brand name covered outpatient drugs at actual acquisition cost plus a dispensing fee. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program provides for civil monetary penalties.
Medicare is a federal health insurance program, administered by CMS, for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions, irrespective of their age. Medicare Part B covers (a) products administered by physicians or other healthcare practitioners, (b) products provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment, (c) certain oral anti-cancer and immunosuppressive drugs. We are required to provide average sales price (“ASP”) information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The submitted information is used to calculate a Medicare payment rate using ASP plus a specified percentage. These rates are adjusted periodically. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statutes provide for civil monetary penalties.
Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e. drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician), including combination products. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, administered by private prescription drug plan sponsors approved by the U.S. government. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs; and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with the manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
Effective January 2018, CMS adopted a policy to pay for separately payable, non-pass-through drugs and biologicals other than vaccines purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Services Act (the “340B Program”), with certain exceptions, at the ASP minus 22.5% rather than ASP plus 6%. Drugs not purchased under the 340B Program will

continue to be paid for at a rate of ASP plus 6%. There has been significant increases in budget pressure, which may adversely impact premium priced agents, such as Feraheme and Makena. 
Our products are available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), pursuant to a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), in which we are required to offer deeply discounted pricing to four federal agencies: VA; Department of Defense (“DOD”); the Coast Guard; and Public Health Services (“PHS”) (including the Indian Health Service) (together the “Big Four”). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is not to exceed the price we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Big Four (including products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if the non-FAMP increases more than inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban. If we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.
Federal law requires that any company participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the PHS’s 340B Program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B Program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The ACA also obligates the Health Resources and Services Administration (the “HRSA”), the agency which administers the 340B Program, to promulgate various regulations and implement processes to improve the integrity of the 340B Program. 
Federal, state and local governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. In 2017, we saw several states and local government either implement or consider implementing price transparency legislation that may prevent or limit our ability to take price increases at certain rates or frequencies. For example, in 2017, California enacted a new law, that went into effect on January 1, 2018 with initial reporting requirements in effect as of January 1, 2019, to facilitate greater transparency in brand-name and generic drug pricing through the implementation of specific price reporting requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The extent and timing of these changes are not known, but future legislation could limit the price and/or payment for prescription drugs. If adequate reimbursement levels are not maintained by government and other third-party payers for our products, our ability to sell our products may be limited and/or our ability to establish acceptable pricing levels may be impaired, thereby reducing anticipated revenues and profitability.
Success of any products we may ultimately seek approval to commercialize outside of the U.S. will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining governmental coverage, as governmental healthcare programs tend to be the dominant third party payers. Products that are not covered and funded by government entities are unlikely to be used in these markets. We cannot be certain we can obtain coverage and reimbursement for our product in markets outside the U.S. Additionally, ability to market our products on a profitable basis may be limited, given governments control prices of prescription medicines though mechanisms such as, but not limited to, international price referencing, therapeutic price reference, price cuts, rebates, revenue related taxes, and profit controls. In markets outside the U.S., the price of the prescriptions medicines tend to decline over the life of the medicine and/or as the volume increases, making it difficult to achieve expected growth in revenue.
Backlog
We had a $9.1 million and $7.6 million sales backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to recognize the $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2019, net of any applicable rebates or credits. These backlogs were largely due to timing of orders received from our third-party logistics providers. Generally, product orders from our customers are fulfilled within a relatively short time of receipt of a customer order.

Employees
As of February 25, 2019, we had 467 employees. This number reflects the impact of approximately110 employees who were displaced in our recently completed restructuring effort, which combined our women’s health and maternal health sales forces into one integrated sales team. We utilize consultants and independent contractors on a regular basis to assist in the development and commercialization of our products. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified sales, technical operations, managerial, scientific and medical personnel of all levels. Although we believe we have been relatively successful to date in obtaining and retaining such personnel, we may not be successful in the future. 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Foreign Operations
We have no foreign operations. We did not have material revenues from customers outside of the U.S. in 2018 and 2017.
