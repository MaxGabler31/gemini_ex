ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW.
 
Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business
 
The financial statements included herein have been prepared by MJ Biotech, Inc. (formerly Michael James Enterprises, Inc.) (the “Company”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We believe that all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. 
 
We were a Company focused on developing intellectual property. Due to the enormous expansion in the cannabis sectors, we have changed our focus to distribution of Hemp (CBD) based Tea products. Pursuant to that we have created a line of CBD infused Teas and Herbs for distribution through our agreement with MarijuanaDoctor.com. Marijuana Doctor operates 15 clinics in the state of Florida. 
 Competition
 
Most of MJ Biotech, Inc.’s competitors are well-established and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Some of our on-line competitors that sell CBD tea products are “Buddha Teas”, “Canna Teas” and “Kikuko’s delicious Positivi-Tea”. MJ Biotech is currently working on increasing its on-line presence. 
 
Governmental regulation regarding hemp derived CBD 
 
In late March 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would introduce legislation legalizing hemp production in his state, Kentucky, and nationally. Majority Leader McConnell introduced the bill, S.2667 as the Hemp Farming Act, on the Senate floor on April 12, 2018, co-sponsored by Oregon senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley. Majority Leader McConnell announced that Representative James Comer of Kentucky would introduce a companion bill in the House of Representatives. The companion bill, H.R. 5485, was also introduced on April 12, 2018 with Colorado Representative Jared Polis co-sponsoring. 
 In addition to removing low-THC cannabis from regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the 2018 act would avail hemp farmers of water rights and federal agricultural grants, and make the national banking system (a gray area for the cannabis industry) accessible to farmers and others involved; and allow for other benefits of production of a recognized crop such as marketing, agronomy research, and crop insurance. 
 The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 was a proposed law to remove hemp (defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% THC) from Schedule I controlled substances and making it an ordinary agricultural commodity. Its provisions were incorporated in the Agriculture Improvement Act 2018 which became law on December 20, 2018. 
 While there are currently relatively few laws or regulations directly applicable to Internet access, E-commerce, or commercial search activity, there is increasing awareness and concern regarding some uses of the Internet and other online services, leading federal, state, local, and international governments to consider adopting civil and criminal laws and regulations, amending existing laws and regulations, conducting investigations, or commencing litigation with respect to the Internet and other online services covering issues such as:
 user privacy;
 
trespass;
 
defamation;
 
database and data protection;
 
limitations on the distribution of materials considered harmful to children;
 
liability for misinformation provided over the web;
 
user protection, pricing, taxation, and advertising restrictions (including, for example, limitation on the advertising on Internet gambling websites or of certain products);
 
delivery of contextual advertisements via connected desktop software;
 
intellectual property ownership and infringement, including liability for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials infringing copyrights or other rights;

distribution, characteristics, and quality of products and services; and
 
other consumer protection laws.
 
Legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. Congress (among these The Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act and The Internet Spyware (I-SPY) Prevention Act) and some state legislatures that is designed to regulate spyware, which does not have a precise definition, but which is often defined as software installed on consumers' computers without their informed consent and designed to gather and, in some cases, disseminate information about those consumers, including personally identifiable information. We do not expect to rely on spyware for any purpose, and it will not be part of our product offerings, but the definition of spyware or proposed legislation relating to spyware may be broadly defined or interpreted to include legitimate ad-serving software, including toolbar offerings and other downloadable software currently provided by our product offerings. Currently, legislation has focused on providing Internet users with notification of and the ability to consent or decline the installation of such software, but there can be no guarantee that future legislation will not provide more burdensome standards by which software can be downloaded onto consumers' computers. We expect that all downloadable software that we will distribute will require an express consent of the consumer and will provide consumers with an easy mechanism to delete the software once downloaded. However, if future legislation is adopted that makes the consent, notice, or uninstall procedures more onerous, we may have to develop new technology or methods to provide our services or discontinue those services in some jurisdictions or altogether. There is no guarantee we will be able to develop this new technology at all or in a timely fashion or on commercially reasonable terms. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations, application of existing laws to the Internet generally or our industry, or any governmental investigation or litigation related to the Internet generally, our industry, or our services may decrease the growth of the Internet or other online services. 
 
Federal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of medical and recreational marijuana laws and regulations may negatively impact our revenues and profits.

Currently, there are 33 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical and/or recreational uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the Controlled Substance Act (the “CSA”), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana products, as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be possession of  marijuana in violation of federal law with respect to any inventory or business operations or we may be deemed to be facilitating the selling or distribution, or aiding and abetting the selling or distribution, of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings and stated federal policy remains uncertain.
 
A memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (the “Cole Memorandum”), provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.
 
The Cole Memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning marijuana enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana possession in small amounts.
 
The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 

Distribution of marijuana to children; 
 
Revenue from the sale of marijuana going to criminals; 
 
Diversion of medical marijuana from states where it is legal to states where it is not; 
 
Using state authorized marijuana activity as a pretext of other illegal drug activity; 
 
Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
 
Preventing drugged driving; 
 
Growing marijuana on federal property; and 
 
Preventing possession or use of marijuana on federal property. 
 
The Cole Memorandum was rescinded by a one-page memo signed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on January 4, 2018. Despite this rescission, the DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 
Variations in state and local regulation and enforcement in states that have legalized medical cannabis that may restrict marijuana-related activities, including activities related to medical cannabis may negatively impact our revenues and profits.

Individual state laws do not always conform to the federal standard or to other states laws. A number of states have decriminalized marijuana to varying degrees, other states have created exemptions specifically for medical cannabis, and several have both decriminalization and medical laws. Eleven states have legalized the recreational use of cannabis. Variations exist among states that have legalized, decriminalized or created medical marijuana exemptions. For example, Alaska and Colorado have limits on the number of marijuana plants that can be homegrown. In most states, the cultivation of marijuana for personal use continues to be prohibited except for those states that allow small-scale cultivation by the individual in possession of medical marijuana needing care or that person’s caregiver. Active enforcement of state laws that prohibit personal cultivation of marijuana may indirectly and adversely affect our business and our revenue and profits.
 
Marijuana remains illegal under Federal law.

Marijuana is a schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to expand our business plan beyond hemp derived CBD.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations.  
 
Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of our business plan and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of our planned operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to certain aspects of our proposed businesses. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
 
Intellectual property. 
 
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We expect to also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our product formulations and other proprietary information.
 Capital Needs
 
Our ability to implement the business model of manufacturing CBD and producing CBD infused products and then marketing those products through stores and also online through our e-commerce website. Our ability to grow our business is dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital for acquisition and growth. We have determined we need to raise approximately $1,500,000 for general operating capital, including funds necessary to hire and compensate executive and other employees, including staffing, support and equipment, advertising and marketing, expansion of business operations, and general working capital. Although we have received approximately $77,559 in promissory notes including interest and $707,589 in convertible promissory notes including interest, during 2016 through 2018 we do not have any firm commitments to provide the balance of this capital to grow the Company of $1,500,000 and pay off the notes of $785,148. Also, there are no assurances we will be successful in raising the necessary capital. In that event, our ability to fully implement our business model and begin generating revenues from our operations would be in jeopardy.
Governmental Regulation 
 
We expect that soon legislation will be introduced in the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures that will be designed to regulate Cannabidiol (CBD). The FDA and some of the state’s respective regulatory agencies, can introduce legislation to control CBD and its by-products. These legislative rules may negatively impact our products and our Companies operation and prevent the Company from fully implementing its business plan.
Proprietary Products
 
While there are currently relatively few laws or regulations directly applicable to the production of Hemp and of Teas and Herbs infused with CBD, we expect that to change in the near future. The majority of our products are proprietary in nature and therefore, we generally rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our technology and products. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and to control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have 2 full time employees, and Company operations are being conducted at our corporate offices.
 
Our History
 
We were organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010 under the name Spicy Gourmet International, Inc. as part of the implementation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. ("SGO"), a California corporation. SGO was incorporated in the State of California in 2006 and was formed to import specialty, organic spices from South Asia and sell them in the United States. SGO was undercapitalized and sales of its spice products were slow to develop, possibly due to the recession in the 2007-2008-time period. As a result, SGO lacked sufficient cash flow to meet its current obligations and on October 1, 2010 SGO filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. SGO's plan of reorganization was confirmed by the Court on November 19, 2010.
 
The plan of reorganization provided for the acquisition by SGO of a new, unrelated, retail business and the spin-off of all of the various elements of SGO's spice business to four different entities. The plan of reorganization called for the spin-off of SGO's manufacturing business to our company, the incorporation of our company, and the distribution of shares of our common stock to the bankruptcy creditors. The plan required us to issue 1,180,000 shares of our common stock and distribute these to SGO's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholders. The shares were distributed pursuant to Section 1145 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
 
The Court also ordered the distribution of warrants to all administrative creditors of SGO, with these creditors to receive five warrants exercisable into shares of our common stock for each $0.05 of SGO's administrative debt which they held. All warrants were exercisable at any time prior to November 19, 2017. No Warrants were exercised prior to their expiration. 
 
We were a “shell company” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 from our date of incorporation until October 2012.
 
On October 20, 2012, we acquired from James M. Palladino, then an unrelated third party, the URL domain name and websites of bullsnbears.com for $150,000. Following this asset purchase we were no longer considered a “shell company.” On October 23, 2012, our former officers and directors resigned and certain of the then officers and directors were appointed, with the balance of our directors being newly appointed in December 2012.
 
In November 2012 we changed our name to BullsnBears.com, Inc. Effective December 11, 2015, we changed our name to Michael James Enterprises, Inc. and filed with FINRA for a new stock ticker symbol “MJTV”. 
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company formed a new wholly owned company, BullsnBears Holdings, LLC., for the purpose of holding the Company’s intellectual property assets. As contractually agreed, to, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, BullsnBears, Holdings LLC. was spun off in its entirety including all of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary including certain liabilities of the parent company that were incurred by the previous management including BullsnBears Holdings, LLC. Intellectual Property assets, including its websites, URL’s, and proprietary software, were transferred through a share dividend to MJTV shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2016, with one share of BullsnBears Holdings, LLC. Common Stock distributed for each one share of MJTV Common Stock owned as of the record date. Distribution of the shares took place on December 28, 2016.
 
On April 12, 2017, the Company changed its name to MJ Biotech, Inc. to better represent the new direction of the Company. MJ Biotech has also changed its state of incorporation to the state of Wyoming. The change of domicile took place on August 25, 2017.
 On June 4, 2018 the Company formed a new wholly owned corporation MJ Syndicated, Inc. a Florida corporation, based out of Florida. Which as of the date of this 10K is non active.
 
Prior to July 26, 2017 the Company focused on developing intellectual property. Since the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, we had changed our focus toward Nutraceuticals. Beginning on October 23, 2018 the Company began to develop proprietary nutraceuticals infused with Hemp based CBD oils and isolates. These products were being produced and are now being offered for sale in wellness stores and on-line prior to the end of 2018.
