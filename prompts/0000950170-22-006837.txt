Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
 
Meta Materials Inc. (the “Company” or “META” or “Resulting Issuer”) is a developer of high-performance functional materials and nanocomposites.

The Company’s registered office is located at 85 Swanson Road, Boxborough, Massachusetts 01719, and its principal executive office is located at 1 Research Drive, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
 
The Company has generated a portfolio of intellectual property and is now moving toward commercializing products at a performance and price point combination that has the potential to be disruptive in multiple market verticals. The Company’s platform technology includes holography, lithography, and medical wireless sensing. The underlying approach that powers the Company’s platform technologies comprises advanced materials, metamaterials and functional surfaces. These materials include structures that are patterned in ways that manipulate light, heat, and electromagnetic waves in unusual ways. The Company’s advanced structural design technologies and scalable manufacturing methods provide a path to broad commercial opportunities in aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, healthcare, consumer electronics, and data transmission.
Controlling light, heat, electricity, and radio waves have played key roles in technological advancements throughout history. Advances in electrical and electromagnetic technologies, wireless communications, lasers, and computers have all been made possible by challenging the understanding of how light and other types of energy naturally behave, and how it is possible to manipulate them. 
Over the past 20 years, techniques for producing nanostructures have matured, resulting in a wide range of groundbreaking solutions that can control light, heat, and electromagnetic waves at very small scales. Some of the areas of advancement that have contributed to these techniques are photonic crystals, nanolithography, plasmonic phenomena and nanoparticle manipulation. From these advances, a new branch of material science has emerged – metamaterials. Metamaterials are composite structures, consisting of conventional materials such as metals and plastics, which are engineered by scientists to exhibit new or enhanced properties relating to reflection, refraction, diffraction, filtering, conductance and other properties that have the potential for multiple commercial applications. 
A metamaterial typically consists of a multitude of structured unit nano-cells that are comprised of multiple individual elements. These are referred to as meta-atoms. The individual elements are usually arranged in periodic patterns that, together, can manipulate light, heat, or electromagnetic waves. Development strategies for metamaterials and functional surfaces focus on structures that produce unusual and exotic electromagnetic properties by manipulating light and other forms of energy in ways that have never been naturally possible. They gain their properties not as much from their composition as from their exactingly designed structures. The precise shape, geometry, size, orientation, and arrangement of these nanostructures affect the light and other electromagnetic waves to create material properties that are not easily achievable with conventional materials.
 The Company has many product concepts currently in various stages of development with multiple potential customers in diverse market verticals. The Company’s business model is to co-develop innovative products or applications with industry leaders that add value. This approach enables the Company to understand market dynamics and ensure the relevance and need for its products.

   Holography Technology 
Holography is a technique where collimated visible wavelength lasers are used to directly write an interference pattern inside the volume of light-sensitive material (photopolymer) in order to produce highly transparent optical filters and holographic optical elements. For some product lines that require large surface areas, this is combined with a proprietary scanning technique, where the lasers, optically or mechanically, directly write nano-patterns to cover large surface areas with nanometer accuracy.
META’s principal products that employ holography technology are its metaAIR® laser glare protection eyewear, metaAIR® laser glare protection films for law enforcement and holoOPTIXTM notch filters. META co-developed its metaAIR® laser glare protection eyewear product with Airbus S.A.S. It has been engineered to provide laser glare protection for pilots, military and law enforcement using META’s holography technology. metaAIR® is a holographic optical filter developed using nano-patterned designs that block and deflect specific colors or wavelengths of light. META launched metaAIR® with strategic and exclusive distribution partner, Satair, a wholly owned Airbus company and started producing and selling metaAIR® in April 2019. The scale-up and specification for the raw photopolymer material used to produce the eyewear was successfully finalized in late 2019 and commercialized in 2020. META launched its laser glare protection films for law enforcement use in late 2020. These films are designed to be applied to face shields and helmet visors providing the wearer with the same type of laser glare eye protection afforded to pilots by metaAIR® glasses while preserving peripheral vision critical to law enforcement duties. HoloOPTIXTM notch filters are optical filters that selectively reject a portion of the spectrum, while transmitting all other wavelengths. They are used in applications where it is necessary to block light from a laser, as in machine vision applications and in confocal or multi-photon microscopy, laser-based fluorescence instrumentation, or other life science applications. HoloOPTIXTM notch filters were commercially launched by the Company in November 2020.
META has additional products in development that utilize its proprietary holography technology. Included in the holoOPTIX TM family of products are holographic optical elements (“HOEs”). HOEs are a core component in the display of augmented reality smart glasses products, as well as (in their larger version) in Heads-Up Displays (“HUDs”), in automobiles and aircraft.
Lithography Technology 
Lithography is a process commonly used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, in which a light-sensitive polymer (photoresist), is exposed and developed to form 3D relief images on the substrate, typically a silicon wafer of up to 300mm (11.8 inches) in diameter. In order to meet the performance, fabrication-speed, and/or cost criteria required for many potential applications that require large area and low cost nanopatterning, the Company has developed a new nanolithography method called “Rolling Mask” lithography (registered trademark RML®), which combines the best features of photolithography, soft lithography and roll-to-plate/roll-to-roll printing capability technologies. Rolling Mask Lithography utilizes a proprietary UV light exposure method where a master pattern is provided in the form of a cylindrical mask. These master patterns are designed by the Company and over the years they have become part of a growing library of patterns, enriching the intellectual property (“IP”) of the Company. The nanostructured pattern on the mask is then rolled over a flat surface area writing a nano-pattern into the volume of a photoresist, creating patterned grooves, metal is then evaporated and fills the patterned grooves. The excess metal is then removed by a known post-process called lift-off. The result is an invisible conductive metal mesh-patterned surface (registered trademark NANOWEB®) that can be fabricated onto any glass or plastic transparent surface in order to offer high transparency, high conductivity and low haze smart materials. 
The Company’s current principal prototype product in lithography technology is its transparent conductive film, NANOWEB®. The lithography division operates out of the Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Metamaterial Technologies USA Inc. ("MTI US"). MTI US can produce meter-long samples of NANOWEB®, at a small volumes scale, for industry customers/partners. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the Company has been ordering and upgrading its equipment at its California facility to efficiently supply NANOWEB® samples in larger volumes. The Company has recently installed its first roll-to-roll, NANOWEB® pilot scale production line at its Pleasanton, California facility. The line is configured for 300mm-wide rolls of substrate. All the equipment passed factory acceptance tests prior to delivery and installation, and the line is currently being optimized.

   There are six NANOWEB®-enabled products and applications that are currently in early stages of development including:
•NANOWEB® for Transparent EMI Shielding
 •NANOWEB® for Transparent Antennas
 •NANOWEB® for 5G signal enhancement
 •NANOWEB® for Touch Screen Sensors
 •NANOWEB® for Solar cells
 •NANOWEB® for Transparent Heating to de-ice and de-fog
 
More details of these products and applications can be found in META’s EDGAR filings and on META’s website at www.metamaterial.com.
The Company has entered into a collaboration agreement with Crossover Solutions Inc. to commercialize the NANOWEB® enabled products and applications for the automotive industry and with ADI Technologies to help secure contracts with the US Department of Defense.
Nano-optic structures and color-shifting foils - the Company recently acquired Nanotech Security Corp. "Nanotech" which specializes in designing, originating, recombining, and mass-producing nanotechnology-based films with application for a wide variety of products and markets. Nanotech develops and produces nano-optic structures and color-shifting foils used in authentication and brand protection applications across a wide range of markets including banknotes, secure government documents, and commercial branding. The Company’s nano-optic security technology platforms include:
 
•KolourOptik®, a patented visual technology that is exclusive to the government and banknote market and combines sub-wavelength nanostructures and microstructures to create modern overt security features with a unique and customizable optical effect. KolourOptik® pure plasmonic color pixels produce full color, 3D depth, and movement used in security stripes and threads that are nearly impossible to replicate. 
 •LiveOptik, a patented visual technology that utilizes innovative nano-optics one tenth the size of traditional holographic structures to create next generation overt security features customized to Nanotech’s customers’ unique requirements. LiveOptik delivers multi-color, 3D depth, movement and image switches for secure brand protection stripes, threads and labels that are nearly impossible to replicate. 
 •LumaChrome optical thin film security features are manufactured using precision engineered nanometer thick layers of metals and ceramics to form filters designed to uniquely manipulate visible and non-visible light. This unique manipulation of light properties is used to create specialized security features in the form of threads, stripes, and patches that are applied to banknotes and other secure documents. By using sophisticated electron beam and sputtered deposition methods, Nanotech precisely controls the construction and inherent properties to provide custom color-shifting solutions. An individual looking at these threads, stripes and patches sees an obvious color shift (e.g. green to magenta) when the document or bank note is tilted or rotated

   Wireless Sensing and Radio Wave Imaging Technology 
META’s Wireless Sensing platform uses infrared and radio frequency (RF) transmitters and receivers to collect and measure a variety of biological information enabling non-invasive and safe medical diagnostics. The platform requires the ability to cancel reflections (anti-reflection) from the skin to reduce the natural impedance the skin provides to such signals and increase the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (“SNR”) of certain diagnostic instruments used in conjunction with the platform. This reflection-cancelling requirement is satisfied using META’s proprietary metamaterial films that employ patterned designs, printed on metal-dielectric structures on flexible substrates that act as anti-reflection (impedance-matching) coatings when placed over the human skin in combination with medical diagnostic modalities, such as MRI, ultrasound systems, non-invasive glucometers etc. The Company is developing a number of medical products that employ this proprietary technology. glucoWISETM, is in development as a completely non-invasive glucose measurement device. It is being developed first as a benchtop medical device product, followed by a portable, pocket-size product and ultimately as a wearable. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increasing the SNR by orders of magnitude has been demonstrated to produce much higher resolution images with significant increases in imaging speed resulting in better patient throughput and potentially more accurate diagnoses in imaging clinics. For example, the Company is developing metaSURFACE (also known as radiWISE) an innovation which allows an improvement in signal to noise ratio of up to 40 times for MRI scans. The metaSURFACE device consists of proprietary non-ferrous metallic and dielectric layers that are exactingly designed to interact (resonate) with radio waves increasing the SNR.META is also researching the use of its Radio Wave Imaging technology in breast cancer and stroke diagnosis.The Company is developing wireless sensing and radio wave imaging applications from its London, UK office and its newly established Athens, Greece office.

   META MATERIALS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 1. Corporate information
Meta Materials Inc. (the “Company” or “META” or “Resulting Issuer”) is a developer of high-performance functional materials and nanocomposites specializing in metamaterial research and products, nanofabrication, and computational electromagnetics. The Company’s registered office is located at 85 Swanson Road, Boxborough, Massachusetts 01719, and its principal executive office is located at 1 Research Drive, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
On March 5, 2020, Metamaterial Inc. (“MMI” or “Resulting Issuer”). and Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (“MTI”) completed a business combination by way of a three-cornered amalgamation pursuant to which MTI amalgamated with a subsidiary of Continental Precious Minerals Inc. (“CPM”), known as Continental Precious Minerals Subco Inc. (“CPM Subco”), to become “Metacontinental Inc.” (the “CPM RTO”). The CPM RTO was completed pursuant to the terms and conditions of an amalgamation agreement dated August 16, 2019 between CPM, MTI and CPM Subco, as amended March 4, 2020. Following the completion of the RTO, Metacontinental Inc. is carrying on the business of the former MTI, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CPM. In connection with the RTO, CPM changed its name effective March 2, 2020 from Continental Precious Minerals Inc. to MMI. The common stock of CPM was delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange on March 4, 2020 and was posted for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) on March 9, 2020 under the symbol “MMAT”.
For accounting purposes, the legal subsidiary, MTI, has been treated as the accounting acquirer and CPM, the legal parent, has been treated as the accounting acquiree. The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are a continuation of MTI consolidated financial statements prior to March 5, 2020 and exclude the balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholder’s equity and statements of cash flows of CPM prior to March 5, 2020. See note 3 for additional information.
On December 14, 2020, the Company (formerly known as “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” or “Torchlight”) and its subsidiaries, Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. (formerly named 2798832 Ontario Inc., “Canco”) and 2798831 Ontario Inc. (“Callco”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Metamaterial Inc., an Ontario corporation headquartered in Nova Scotia, Canada (“MMI”), to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of MMI by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario), on and subject to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Torchlight RTO”). On June 25, 2021, the Company implemented a reverse stock split, changed its name from “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” to “Meta Materials Inc.” and changed its trading symbol from “TRCH” to “MMAT”. On June 28, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the Arrangement was completed.
On June 28, 2021, and pursuant to the completion of the Arrangement Agreement, the Company began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol “MMAT” while MMI common stock was delisted from the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) and at the same time, Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of META, started trading under the symbol “MMAX” on the CSE. Certain previous shareholders of MMI elected to convert their common stock of MMI into exchangeable shares in Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. These exchangeable shares, which can be converted into common stock of META at the option of the holder, are similar in substance to common shares of META and have been included in the determination of outstanding common shares of META.
For accounting purposes, the legal subsidiary, MMI, has been treated as the accounting acquirer and the Company, the legal parent, has been treated as the accounting acquiree. The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are a continuation of MMI consolidated financial statements prior to June 28, 2021 and exclude the balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and statements of cash flows of Torchlight prior to June 28, 2021. See note 3 for additional information.

   2. Significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation – These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The Company’s fiscal year-end is December 31. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Materials Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Functional currency – Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company and its subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).

Reporting Currency – The reporting currency of the Company is in US Dollars. The consolidated financial statements, and the financial information contained herein, are reported in US dollars, except share amounts or as otherwise stated, as the Company believes this results in more relevant and reliable information for its financial statement users.
   
 | transactions and balances – Foreign currency transactions are recorded into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the associated transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the measurement at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of operations.


 | translation – The results and financial position of all subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:


 | Company’s assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet;


 | Company’s income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates;


 | Company’s resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, a separate component of equity.


Use of estimates – The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of goodwill, the valuation of net assets acquired via business combinations; the valuation of oil & natural gas properties, and the valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value.


Cash and cash equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.


Inventory – Inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) for all inventory. Inventory consumed during research and development activities is recorded as a research and development expense.


Long-lived assets – Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.


Assets held for sale – Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. See Note 3 for further discussion of assets held for sale.




Page


  Goodwill – Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually)
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.
  The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to test the reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative
assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50
percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, the Company compares the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.


Acquired intangibles – In accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, the Company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets consist of acquired technology and customer relationships. In valuing acquired intangible assets, the Company makes assumptions and estimates based in part on projected financial information, which makes assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain, particularly for early-stage technology companies. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible technology assets include the revenue growth rate, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired customer contract intangible assets include the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.
  As a result of the judgments that need to be made, the Company obtains the assistance of independent valuation firms. The Company completes these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.


Business combinations - The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.

  Leases - The Company is a lessee in several non-cancellable operating leases for buildings. The Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC 842 Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
For operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured in the same manner and date as for operating leases and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective-interest rate method.
The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The ROU asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received.

Government grants and assistance – Government grants are recognized at their fair value in the period when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attaching to the grant will be met and that the grant will be received. Grants are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income over the useful life of the depreciable asset by way of government assistance.


Page


  The Company also receives interest-free repayable loans from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (“ACOA”), a government agency. The benefit of the loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates. The fair value of the components, being the loan and the government grant, must be calculated initially in order to allocate the proceeds to the components. The valuation is complex, as there is no active trading market for these items and is based on unobservable inputs.





Page


  Revenue recognition – The Company’s revenue is generated from product sales as well as development revenue. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance obligations under the terms of its contracts, and control of its products is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive from its customers in exchange for those products or services.

Revenue from the sale of prototypes and finished products is recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of goods. The Company considers whether there are other obligations in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of prototypes, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financial components, non-cash consideration and consideration payable to the customer (if any).

Revenue from development activities is recognized over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the research activities and associated performance obligations identified within each contract have been satisfied.


Deferred revenue – consist of fees invoiced or paid by the Company’s customers for which the associated performance obligations have not been satisfied and revenue has not been recognized based on the Company’s revenue recognition criteria described above.
Deferred revenue is reported in a net position on an individual contract basis at the end of each reporting period and is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur more than one year from the balance sheet date.


Fair value measurements – The Company uses valuation approaches that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
   
 | Level 1 inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.


 | Level 2 inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.


 | Level 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.


Fair value option – Under the Fair Value Option Subsections of ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments – Overall, the Company has the irrevocable option to report certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair value reported in the statement of operations. Any changes in the fair value of liabilities resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk are reported in other comprehensive income.


Research and development – Research and development activities are expensed as incurred.

  Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share gives effect to all dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period including stock options, deferred stock units (“DSUs”), Restricted Share Units ("RSUs"), and warrants which are calculated using the treasury stock method, and convertible debt instruments using the if-converted method. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes all dilutive potential stock if their effect is anti-dilutive.


Stock based compensation – The Company recognizes compensation expense for equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees that have a graded vesting schedule based on a service condition only on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards (the “graded-vesting attribution method”), based on the estimated grant date fair value for each separately vesting tranche. For equity awards with a graded vesting schedule and a combination of service and performance conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using a graded-vesting attribution method over the requisite service period when the achievement of a performance-based milestone is probable, based on the relative satisfaction of the performance condition as of the reporting date.

For stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, compensation expense is recognized using the graded-vesting attribution method over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed.
The measurement date for each tranche of employee awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the employees’ requisite service period, which is the vesting period.

The Company estimates the grant date fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and estimates the number of forfeitures expected to occur. The Company may use other pricing models when applicable such as Monte-Carlo simulation. See note 15 for the Company’s assumptions used in connection with option grants made during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements.


Income taxes – Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.

Authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an examination. Management has reviewed the Company’s tax positions and determined there were no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Company tax returns remain subject to Federal, Provincial and State tax examinations. Generally, the applicable statutes of limitation are three to four years from their respective filings.

   3. Acquisitions and preferred stock liability
Torchlight RTO
Arrangement
As discussed in note 1, on December 14, 2020, Meta Materials Inc. and its subsidiaries, Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. and 2798831 Ontario Inc. (“Callco”) entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of MMI. On March 12, 2021, MMI’s annual general and special meeting was held and MMI’s securityholders approved the Arrangement and on June 11, 2021, approval was obtained from Torchlight shareholders through a special meeting.
On June 25, 2021, Torchlight effected a reverse stock split of its Common Stock, at a ratio of two-to-one, changed its name from “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” to “Meta Materials Inc.” and declared a dividend, on a one-for-one basis, of stock of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to holders of record of Company Common Stock as of June 24, 2021.
On June 28, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the Arrangement was completed. The stock of Company Common Stock, previously traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “TRCH,” commenced trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “MMAT”.

Page


  Securities conversion
Pursuant to the completion of the Arrangement, each common share of MMI that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to June 28, 2021 was converted into the right to receive 1.845 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Resulting Issuer or stock of Canco, which are exchangeable for shares of the Resulting Issuer at the election of each former MMI stockholder. In addition, all of MMI’s outstanding options, deferred share units and other securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, and any other rights to acquire MMI Common Stock were exchanged for securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, or other rights to acquire Resulting Issuer Common Stock. Immediately following the completion of the RTO, the former security holders of MMI owned approximately 70% of the Resulting Issuer Common Stock, accordingly, the former shareholders of MMI, as a group, retained control of the Resulting Issuer, and while Torchlight was the legal acquirer of MMI, MMI was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes.
Reverse acquisition
Pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition since: (i) the shareholders of MMI owned the majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company after the share exchange; (ii) a majority of the directors of the Company are also directors of MMI; and (iii) the previous officers of the Company were replaced with officers designated by MMI. The Company and MMI remain separate legal entities (with the Company as the parent of MMI). These consolidated financial statements are those of MMI prior to June 28, 2021 and exclude the balance sheets, results of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, and statements of cash flows of Torchlight prior to June 28, 2021.
Measuring the Consideration Transferred
The accounting acquirer issued no cash consideration for the acquiree. Instead, the accounting acquiree issued its 196,968,803 common shares to the owners of the accounting acquirer. However, the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer for its interest in the accounting acquiree is based on the number of equity interests the legal subsidiary would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal parent the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. Accordingly, the consideration transferred of $358,138,773 was based on the following calculation:
•The assumption that MMI would have issued 44,885,634 shares to Torchlight in order for MMI shareholders to own approximately 70% of the outstanding Combined Company Stock at a share price of $7.96, the closing share price of MMI on June 28, 2021 to equal $357,289,644. 
•Adding the fair value of deemed issuance of Torchlight options and warrants that were outstanding at the time of acquisition. 
•Deducting the estimated fair value of the previously existing unsecured promissory notes issued by MMI to Torchlight of $11,000,000 plus interest. These notes were effectively settled pursuant to the closing of the Arrangement. 
The fair value of the number of equity interests calculated in that way can be used as the fair value of consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree. The assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts.



Page

  Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements Post Reverse Acquisition
The consolidated financial statements reflect all of the following:
a)the assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts 
b)the assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations
c)the retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination 
d)the amount recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent (accounting acquiree). However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) 
All references to common stock, options, deferred share units, and warrants as well as per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) issued in the reverse acquisition.
Pursuant to the completion of Torchlight RTO on June 28, 2021 and as a result of information presented post acquisition, the Company has made the following changes to the purchase price allocation previously disclosed in the interim financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 in Form 10-Q:
•decreased the consideration by $169,592 and reclassed the preferred stock liability from the consideration value to the acquired liabilities.
•decreased the value of the acquired oil and natural gas ("O&G") assets and the preferred stock liability by $197,608 and $5,306,354 respectively, to reflect the finalization of a third-party valuation study of the O&G assets as of June 28, 2021. 
•decreased working capital by $1,034,288 as a result of recording pre-acquisition receivable of $3,404,866, liabilities of $865,650 and reduce cash as of June 28, 2021 by $3,573,504. The pre-acquisition receivable represents shares issued before acquisition date where the cash was received immediately after the acquisition date.
•As a result, the Goodwill balance has decreased by $4,244,265.

The Company believes that information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, however the Company is waiting for additional information necessary to finalize these fair values including assessment of any tax assets and liabilities and tax position in different jurisdictions. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value set forth below are subject to change. The Company expects to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

 | Amount | 
Fair value of deemed issuance of MMI’s stock – Common Stock | $ | 82,814 | 
Fair value of deemed issuance of MMI’s stock – Additional paid in capital | | 357,206,830 | 
Fair value of Torchlight’s outstanding warrants – Additional paid in capital | | 2,773,778 | 
Fair value of Torchlight’s outstanding options – Additional paid in capital | | 9,397,988 | 
Total Effect on Equity | | 369,461,410 |

Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 143,381,229 | 
Other assets | | 3,906,290 | 
Oil and natural gas properties | | 72,600,000 | 
Preferred stock liability | | (72,600,000 | )
Accounts payable | | (2,496,510 | )
Other liabilities | | (21,937 | )
Goodwill | | 213,369,701 | 
 | $ | 358,138,773 | 


1 Notes receivable/payable
Notes receivable or payable represent unsecured promissory notes previously issued by MMI to Torchlight between September 20, 2020 to February 18, 2021 for proceeds of $11,000,000 plus interest. These notes have been eliminated upon acquisition and subsequent consolidation (see note 10 to these consolidated financial statements for further details).

2 Oil and natural gas properties and preferred stock liability

Valuation at acquisition
Acquired oil and natural gas properties include the Orogrande Project property in West Texas and the Hazel Project property in the Midland basin in West Texas. Refer to note 5 for additional details.
The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair value of the Orogrande Project property and the Hazel Project property as of June 28, 2021 and December 31, 2021.
The estimated fair value of the Orogrande Project property was calculated as the sum of the median of each of:
•a range of fair values of identified drilling locations determined using numerous assumptions including the number of drilling locations, forecasted production volumes per drilling location, fair value per barrel of forecasted production volumes based on comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and applying a drilling location risk factor (collectively, “drilling location assumptions”); and 


Page


  •a range of fair values of the undeveloped land acreage determined using numerous assumptions including the number of undeveloped land acres, fair value per acre for comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and applying an acreage risk factor (collectively, “undeveloped land assumptions”).
The estimated fair value of the Hazel Project property was calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of the Hazel Project property at acquisition date included forecasted production volumes, forecasted commodity prices, and the discount rate.
The Company valuation concluded an implied enterprise value as of June 28, 2021 to be between $57.7 million and $101.1 million. The Company recorded the fair value of the Orogrande Project property at $71.1 million and the fair value of the Hazel Project property at $1.5 million, totaling a value of $72.6 million.
On June 11, 2021, Torchlight’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of Torchlight’s preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Preferred Stock”), from 10,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares. In addition, Torchlight’s Board of Directors formally declared the Preferred Dividend and set June 24, 2021 as the Dividend Record Date.
On June 25, 2021, the Company declared a dividend, on a one-for-one basis, of shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) to holders of record of Torchlight’s common stock as of June 24, 2021. This preferred stock entitles its holders to receive certain dividends based on the net proceeds of the sale of any assets that are used or held for use in the Company’s oil and gas exploration business (the “O&G Assets”), subject to certain holdbacks. Such asset sales must occur prior to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2021 or (ii) the date which is six months from the closing of the Arrangement, or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and the individual appointed to serve as the representative of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Sale Expiration Date”). The Series A Preferred Stock will automatically be cancelled once the entitled dividends have been paid.

As a result, the fair value measurement of the oil and natural gas properties also forms the basis for the fair value measurement of the preferred stock liability as of June 28, 2021 and as of December 31, 2021. The preferred stock liability is accounted for in accordance with ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.

  2021 developments
After the closing of the merger transaction with Torchlight, the Company engaged in a series of activities related to the oil and gas assets to ensure that compliance with the relevant leases was maintained and that the lease rights retained their value in advance of a possible sale or other disposition. The activities over a 4-month period were focused on the obligation to drill four wells on the subject leased property by year-end 2021 to ensure continued compliance with the lease requirements. The activities included assembly of a team of professionals to manage the efforts, permitting, site preparation, drilling equipment rentals, pad preparations at each of the four sites and a variety of site clean-up, data summarization and similar activities. In 2021, the Company invested approximately $14.2 million in these activities to preserve compliance and the value of the assets. These costs were initially capitalized and then assessed at December 31, 2021 to determine if an adjustment was required to the carrying value based on the updated fair value determination. In addition to the drilling activities, the Company organized a new wholly owned subsidiary to enable consolidation of the leases into one company to help facilitate any future sale or other disposition of the assets and provide additional structural alternatives for such sale or disposition.

Valuation at December 31, 2021
The Company continues to actively explore the sale of the assets or spinout, should a sale not occur. The Company estimated the fair value of the O&G assets by obtaining a valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm. The estimates involved are consistent with those outlined above as part of the acquisition. The valuation concluded an implied enterprise value as of December 31, 2021 to be between $55.1 million and $109.0 million. The Company recorded the fair value of the Orogrande Project property at $72.0 million and the fair value of the Hazel Project property at $3.5 million, totaling a value of $75.5 million.
There are 164,923,363 outstanding Series A Non-Voting Preferred shares as of December 31, 2021.

3 Goodwill
Goodwill is attributed to the difference between the total consideration calculated above and deemed to be transferred by the accounting acquirer (MMI) and, the total net assets of the accounting acquiree (Torchlight). Based on the market value of META's Stock on June 28, 2021, this resulted in total “consideration” being transferred to Torchlight of approximately $358.1 million. Further, the net assets of Torchlight acquired by MMI has been estimated to be approximately $144.8 million. The difference between the $358.1 million of consideration deemed to have been transferred and the $144.8 million of net assets acquired results in goodwill of approximately $213.4 million. Torchlight is delivering a NASDAQ listed legal entity in good standing that will provide the Company with ready access to significant capital sources in the future to fund its growth plans.
The company deemed it necessary to perform an annual test for impairment at December 31, 2021 due to market conditions. As at December 31, 2021 no impairment was found.
Revenue and losses from the Torchlight RTO since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $Nil and $15.8 million respectively.

Unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included below as if the Torchlight RTO occurred on January 1, 2020. This summary of the unaudited pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s results of operations would have been had Torchlight been acquired at the beginning of 2020, nor does it purport to represent results of operations for any future periods.

  Nanotech acquisition

On August 5, 2021, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to indirectly acquire Nanotech Security Corp. (“Nanotech”). On October 5, 2021, a wholly-owned subsidiary of META purchased 100% of Nanotech’s common stock at CA$1.25 per share. In addition, the transaction price included the settlement of certain Nanotech share awards outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the agreement, including the repurchase and cancellation of 303,391 Nanotech restricted share units ("RSU") at a purchase price of CA$1.25 per RSU and the settlement of 4,359,000 Nanotech in-the-money stock options at a purchase price equal to CA$1.25 per option, less the exercise price thereof. The consideration payable to securityholders under the arrangement was payable in cash, resulting in a total purchase price of $72.1 million (CA$90.8 million).

The Company believes that information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, however the Company is waiting for additional information necessary to finalize these fair values including assessment of any tax assets and liabilities and tax position in different jurisdictions. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value set forth below are subject to change. The Company expects to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
The preliminary allocation of consideration paid for the Nanotech acquisition is summarized as follows:


 | Amount | 
Consideration paid to acquire Nanotech outstanding common stock | $ | 69,214,652 | 
Consideration paid to repurchase Nanotech restricted stock units (RSUs) | | 300,610 | 
Consideration paid to repurchase Nanotech stock options | | 2,612,035 | 
 | $ | 72,127,297 | 
Net assets (liabilities) of Nanotech: | | 
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 5,974,254 | 
Accounts receivable | | 741,783 | 
Trade payables | | (1,349,139 | )
Prepaid expenses | | 271,741 | 
Inventory | | 126,326 | 
Property and equipment | | 14,771,456 | 
Intangibles | | 25,309,847 | 
Deferred tax liability | | (859,394 | )
Goodwill | | 27,140,423 | 
 | $ | 72,127,297 | 


The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value and tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain contracts and obligations. Any additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of acquisition.

The estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities has been measured as at the acquisition date based on a valuation report provided by a third-party valuation expert.

Acquired property, plant and equipment acquired totaling $14.8 million is comprised primarily of a production facility in Quebec, Canada with an estimated fair value of $6.0 million, as well as specialized machinery and equipment with an estimated fair value of $8.6 million.



Page


  Acquired intangible assets totaling $25.3 million include a developed optical thin film technology intangible asset ($0.2 million), a developed nanotechnology intangible asset ($14.8 million) as well as a customer contract intangible asset for $10.3 million. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible technology assets include the revenue growth rate, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of the acquired customer contract intangible asset include the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.

The goodwill resulting from the transaction is attributable to different factors including assembled workforce, Nanotech's market potential, specific purchase synergies, technical know-how and expertise, customer service capabilities, geographical presence, and manufacturing capabilities.
Revenue and losses from the Nanotech acquisition since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1.8 million and $0.9 million respectively.

Unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included below as if the Nanotech acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020. This summary of the unaudited pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s results of operations would have been had Nanotech been acquired at the beginning of 2020, nor does it purport to represent results of operations for any future periods.

CPM RTO
As outlined in note 1, on August 16, 2019, MTI entered into an Amalgamation Agreement (“Amalgamation Agreement”) with CPM, a Canadian public company listed on the CSE in relation to a Reverse Takeover transaction of CPM by MTI (“CPM RTO”). On October 10, 2019, CPM shareholders approved matters ancillary to the transaction and on November 25, 2019, MTI shareholders approved the CPM RTO. Subject to an amendment to the Amalgamation Agreement dated March 4, 2020, the CPM RTO was completed on March 5, 2020.

The CPM RTO was completed by the way of three-cornered amalgamation, whereby MTI was amalgamated with CPM Subco and holders of stock of MTI received common stock of MMI as consideration. Pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement, the holders of the common stock of MTI (“MTI Common Stock”) and holders of MTI’s Class A-1 preferred stock of MTI received MMI Common Stock in exchange for their MTI Common Stock at a ratio of 2.75 MMI Common Stock for each MTI Common Share or Class A-1 Preferred share held. Also pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement, the holders of MTI’s Class A-2 preferred stock received 4.125 Resultant Issuer Common Stock for each Class A-2 preferred share held.

Upon completion of the CPM RTO, all of MTI’s outstanding options, deferred share units and other securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, and any other rights to acquire MTI Common Stock were exchanged for securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, or other rights to acquire MMI Common Stock. Immediately

  following the completion of the CPM RTO, the former security holders of MTI owned approximately 86% of the Resulting Issuer Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis; accordingly, the former shareholders of MTI, as a group, retained control of MMI, and while CPM was the legal acquirer of MTI, MTI was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. As CPM did not meet the definition of a business as defined in ASC 805—Business Combinations, the acquisition is not within the scope of ASC 805 and was considered to be a reverse recapitalization.

Reverse recapitalization accounting applies when a non-operating public shell company (CPM) acquires a private operating company (MTI) and the owners and management of the private operating company have actual or effective voting and operating control of the combined company. A reverse recapitalization is equivalent to the issuance of stock by the private operating company for the net monetary assets of the public shell corporation accompanied by a recapitalization with accounting similar to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that no goodwill or other intangible assets are recorded.

Since the transaction was treated as capital transaction in substance, the consideration transferred was assumed to equal the fair value of CPM’s net monetary assets of $3,110,834. Consideration transferred was then allocated between stock and options based on the fair value of the options deemed to have been issued. Accordingly, $212,566 has been allocated to options as outlined in consolidated Statements of changes in stockholders’ equity with the remainder $2,898,268 allocated to common stock.

The carrying value of CPM’s assets and liabilities have been assumed to approximate their fair values, due to their short-term nature. The following table summarizes the monetary assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the March 5, 2020 exchange rate of $1.00 CAD = $0.7454 USD:


 | Amount | 
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 3,112,172 | 
Marketable securities | | 3,274 | 
Accounts receivable | | 20,277 | 
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | | (24,889 | )
 | $ | 3,110,834 | 

The fair value of CPM’s 700,000 options issued has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:


 | Amount 
Risk free interest rate | 0.83% - 0.96%
Expected volatility | 117% -134% 
Expected dividend yield | 0% 
Expected forfeiture rate | 0% 
Fair value of Resulting Issuer Common Share | CA$0.62 
Exercise price of the options | CA$0.35 
Expected term for directors resigning from CPM board | 6 months 
Expected term for a director continuing as Resulting Issuer director | 8 years 

Revenue and losses from the CPM RTO since the acquisition date were Nil since acquisition.

 
4. Related party transactions
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, receivables due from a related party (Lamda Guard Technologies Ltd, or “LGTL”) were for a nominal amount and $nil, respectively. On March 16, 2021, MMI converted an amount of $0.3 million owing to LGTL into 81,584 MMI common stock for a price per share of CA$4.51. The conversion price


Page | 83


  of CA$4.51 per share represented a 10% premium to the CA$4.10 closing price of MMI stock on the CSE at the close of business on March 12, 2021. MMI has recognized $0.2 million in common stock in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity at fair value at the time of conversion and recorded the difference of $0.1 million between the fair value of the common stock and the carrying value of the extinguished liability as a loss on debt settlement in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, related party payables due to LGTL were $Nil and $0.2 million respectively.
5. Assets held for sale

As of December 31, 2021, assets held for sale represented the acquired oil and natural gas properties from the Torchlight RTO. Refer to note 3 for details of the fair value determination.
  Orogrande Project, West Texas
  On August 7, 2014, Torchlight entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), and Gregory McCabe, Torchlight prior Chairman. Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, Torchlight purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which held certain oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in approximately 172,000 predominately contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. Mr. McCabe has, at his option, a 10% working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and conditions of a participation and development agreement among Hudspeth, MPC and Mr. McCabe. Mr. McCabe also holds a 4.5% overriding royalty interest in the Orogrande acreage, which he obtained prior to, and was not a part of the August 2014 transaction.
  Effective March 27, 2017, the property became subject to a DDU Agreement which allows for all 192 existing leases covering approximately 134,000 net acres leased from University Lands to be combined into one drilling and development unit for development purposes. The term of the DDU Agreement expires on December 31, 2023, and the time to drill on the drilling and development unit continues through December 2023. The DDU Agreement also grants the right to extend the DDU Agreement through December 2028 if compliance with the DDU Agreement is met and the extension fee associated with the additional time is paid.

On July 25, 2018, Torchlight and Hudspeth entered into a Settlement & Purchase Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Founders (and Founders Oil & Gas Operating, LLC, former Operator), Wolfbone and MPC (entities controlled by Torchlight prior Chairman), which agreement provided for Founders assigning all of its working interest in the oil and gas leases of the Orogrande Project to Hudspeth and Wolfbone equally. Future well capital spending obligations remained the same 50% contribution from Hudspeth and 50% from Wolfbone until such time as the $40.5 million to be spent on the project.
  The Company's outstanding drilling obligations includes five wells in 2022 and 2023. All drilling obligations through December 31, 2021 have been met. The drilling obligations are minimum yearly requirements and may be exceeded if acceleration is desired.
  The Orogrande Project ownership as of December 31, 2021 is detailed as follows:

Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas
  Effective April 4, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of Torchlight acquired from MPC a 66.66% working interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the Midland Basin. A back-in after payout of a 25% working interest was retained by MPC and another unrelated working interest owner.
  In October 2016, the holders of Torchlight's outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (which were issued in July 2016) elected to convert into a total 33.33% working interest in the Hazel Project, reducing Torchlight ownership from 66.66% to a 33.33% working interest.
  On January 30, 2017, Torchlight entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and a Plan of Merger with an entity which was wholly-owned by Mr. McCabe, which resulted in the acquisition of approximately 40.66% working interest in the 12,000 gross acres, 9,600 net acres, in the Hazel Project.
  Also, on January 30, 2017, the Company entered into and closed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Wolfbone. Under the agreement, Torchlight acquired certain of Wolfbone’s Hazel Project assets, including its interest in the Flying B Ranch #1 well and the 40 acre unit surrounding the well.
  Upon the closing of the transactions, Torchlight's working interest in the Hazel Project increased by 40.66% to a total ownership of 74%.
  Effective June 1, 2017, Torchlight acquired an additional 6% working interest from unrelated working interest owners increasing its working interest in the Hazel project to 80%, and an overall net revenue interest of -%.
  The Company has drilled six test wells on the Hazel Project to capture and document the scientific base in support of demonstrating the production potential of the property.
  Option Agreement with Masterson Hazel Partners, LP
  On August 13, 2020, Torchlight's subsidiaries Torchlight Energy, Inc. and Torchlight Hazel, LLC (collectively, “Torchlight”) entered into an option agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Masterson Hazel Partners, LP (“MHP”) and McCabe Petroleum Corporation. Under the agreement, MHP was obligated to drill and complete, or cause to be drilled and completed, at its sole cost and expense, a new lateral well (the “Well”) on the Hazel Project, sufficient to satisfy Torchlight’s continuous development obligations on the southern half of the prospect no later than September 30, 2020. MHP has satisfied this drilling obligation. MHP paid to Torchlight $1,000 as an option fee at the time of execution of the Option Agreement. MHP is entitled to receive, as its sole recourse for the recoupment of drilling costs, the revenue from production of the Well attributable to Torchlight’s interest until such time as it has recovered its reasonable costs and expenses for drilling, completing, and operating the well.
  In exchange for MHP satisfying the above drilling obligations, Torchlight granted to MHP the exclusive right and option to perform operations, at MHP’s sole cost and expense, on the Hazel Project sufficient to satisfy Torchlight’s continuous development obligations on the northern half of the prospect. Because MHP exercised this drilling option and satisfied the continuous development obligations on the northern half of the prospect, under the terms of the Option Agreement (as amended in September 2020) MHP had the option to

  purchase the entire Hazel Project no later than May 31, 2021 under the terms of a form of Purchase and Sale Agreement included as an exhibit to the Option Agreement, at an aggregate purchase price of $12,690,704 for approximately 9,762 net mineral acres, and not less than 74% net revenue interest (approximately $1,300 per net mineral acre).The option expired unexercised and concurrently, all of the Hazel Project leases expired except for those leases relating to the two producing wells. The continuing leases cover approximately 645 gross acres, 516 net acres, in the Hazel Project.
  Hunton Play, Central Oklahoma
  Presently, the Company is producing from one well in the Viking Area of Mutual Interest and one well in Prairie Grove. These assets were not included in the valuation by a third party valuation firm given their nominal value.

Goodwill
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $213.4 million in goodwill from the Torchlight RTO and $27.1 million in goodwill from the Nanotech acquisition.

The Company performs the annual impairment test for goodwill at year-end, by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2021, using the market approach to determine fair value. As the reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying amount, the Company determined that goodwill was not impaired. The key assumption used to calculate the recoverable amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2021 was the Company’s share price.

a) In November 2020, MMI entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with a shareholder, pursuant to which the shareholder will provide up to CA$5,500,000 in debt financing (the “Bridge Loan”) to fund MMI’s continued operations while MMI worked toward completion of the Proposed Transaction with Torchlight. Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, MMI was able to draw up to CA$500,000 monthly beginning in November 2020. The Bridge Loan bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. The principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest was due and payable on the 10th business day after the closing of the Proposed Transaction, or on November 29, 2022, if the Transaction did not close before that date. At the option of the holder, the Bridge Loan, or any portion of the Bridge Loan and accrued but unpaid interest was convertible into MMI Common Stock at a conversion price of CA$0.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments. MMI had the option to repay the Bridge Loan in whole or in part, without penalty, at any time on or after March 28, 2021.
MMI elected to measure the financial instrument at fair value. MMI subsequently remeasured the instrument on December 31, 2020 and recorded fair value loss of $139,609 in the statements of operations. There was no change in instrument specific credit risk.
On February 16, 2021, the total Bridge Loan of $4,361,930 of principal and accrued interest was converted at CA$0.50 per share into 20,391,239 common shares, in accordance with the terms of the bridge financing. MMI has remeasured the instrument as of the conversion date and recognized a non-cash realized fair value loss of $19,163,417 and the full amount of $23,656,365 was reclassified into the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity.
b) On September 15, 2020, MMI entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Torchlight pursuant to which Torchlight loaned MMI three unsecured convertible promissory notes totaling $11,000,000. These Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes bore interest at 8% annually, with principal and interest due and payable on the maturity date. If MMI and Torchlight had not entered into a Definitive Agreement, or the Definitive Agreement were terminated, then the Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes and all


Page | 89


  accrued and unpaid interest were convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of the Company at the conversion prices set out below. The Company had the option to repay all or part of the Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, without penalty on or after 120 days from the note issuance date.

  The conversion option was a foreign currency embedded derivative as the note was denominated in USD and the conversion price was in Canadian dollars. MMI elected to measure the financial instrument at fair value. MMI subsequently remeasured the instrument on March 31, 2021, and recorded fair value gain of $197,527, of which $5,554 was a gain recorded in other comprehensive income relating to instrument specific credit risk and $191,973 was a gain recorded in the statements of operations.

  As part of the closing of the Arrangement, the promissory notes were remeasured at fair value and a fair value loss of $525,920 was recorded in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The notes were considered part of the consideration transferred (see note 3) and were eliminated upon acquisition and subsequent consolidation. In addition, the related accumulated fair value losses in OCI of $9,011 were recycled to the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

On April 3, 2020, MMI issued CA$5,000,000 in Secured Debentures to BDC Capital Inc.(“BDC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Business Development Bank of Canada. The Secured Debentures mature on October 31, 2024, and bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, payable monthly in cash. In addition to the cash interest, the Secured Debentures accrued a non-compounding payment in kind (“PIK”) of 8% per annum. The PIK may be reduced by up to 3% (reduced to as low as 5% per annum) upon meeting certain conditions. BDC may elect to have the PIK paid in cash.
The Secured Debentures and the PIK are convertible in full or in part, at BDC’s option, into MMI common stock at any time prior to their maturity at a conversion price of CA$0.70 (the “Conversion Price”) or MMI may force the conversion of Secured Debentures if MMI’s common stock are trading on the CSE on a volume-weighted average price greater than 100% of the Conversion Price (i.e. greater than CA$1.40) for any 20 consecutive trading days with a minimum daily volume of at least 100,000 Common Stock.
MMI elected to measure the financial instrument at fair value. MMI subsequently remeasured the instrument on December 31, 2020, and recorded a fair value loss of $1,376,979, of which $511,699 was recorded in other comprehensive income relating to instrument specific credit risk and $865,280 was recorded in the statements of operations.
The secured debentures were subject to a covenant clause, whereby MMI was required to maintain a working capital ratio of no less than 3:1. The working capital ratio excluded deferred revenue and deferred government assistance from current liabilities. MMI did not fulfil the ratio as required in the contract and consequently, the secured debentures were reclassified as a current liability as at December 31, 2020.
On March 3, 2021, MMI forced the conversion of the Secured Debentures pursuant to the terms of the agreement with BDC. The total debentures balance of $3,910,954 was converted at CA$0.70 per share into 14,155,831 common shares. MMI remeasured the liability as of the conversion date and recognized a non-cash realized fair value loss of $16,408,482 and the full amount of $22,118,782 was reclassified into the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. All security interests held by BDC on assets of MMI were immediately discharged.
In addition, the accumulated losses in OCI of $511,699 were recycled to the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

  The weighted average remaining contractual life for the stock options outstanding as at December 31, 2021 was 7.65 (December 31, 2020 – 8.36) years. There were 1,500,000 and 13,402,080 stock options granted with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $6.27 and $0.39 per share respectively during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020.
The fair value of options granted was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted-average assumptions:
   
 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 
Dividend yield [%] | — | — | — 
Volatility | 84% | 52%-134% | 84%-130% 
Risk-free interest rate | 0.73% | 0.73% | 1.21% 
Expected term (in years) | 1 year | 7.48 years | 8.67 years


The expected life of the stock options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

At December 31, 2021, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $91.3 million (2020: $34.7 million) that can be used to offset future taxable income, and such NOLs, as well as timing differences from certain financial instruments, result in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $27.2 million (2020: $10.2 million). These NOLs begin to expire in 2028.

In evaluating its valuation allowance, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income and recent financial performance. Due to uncertainty with respect to the ultimate realizability of these deferred tax assets, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $18.7 million (2020: $9.1 million) against its deferred tax assets.

19. Fair value measurements
The Company uses a fair value hierarchy, based on the relative objectivity of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 representing inputs with the highest level of objectivity and Level 3 representing the lowest level of objectivity.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, grants and accounts receivables, due from (to) related parties and trade and other payables approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The current portion of long-term debt has been included in the below table.
The fair values of convertible promissory notes secured convertible debentures and unsecured convertible debentures are classified at level 3 as they were accounted for under the fair value option election of ASC 825 and the estimated fair value was computed using significant inputs that are not observable in the market.
The fair value of assets held for sale is classified at level 3 as the fair value of the O&G assets was estimated by obtaining a valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm. Refer to note 3 for the significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value.


Page


  The fair value of the preferred stock liability is also classified as level 3 since the fair value measurement of the oil and natural gas properties forms the basis for the fair value measurement of the preferred stock liability as of June 28, 2021 and as of December 31, 2021.
The fair values of the funding obligation, operating lease liabilities, and long-term debt would be classified at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as each instrument is estimated based on unobservable inputs including discounted cash flows using the market rate, which is subject to similar risks and maturities with comparable financial instruments as at the reporting date.
Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows:
   
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Financial liability | Carrying value | | Fair value | | | Carrying value | | Fair value
Funding obligation | $ | 268,976 | | $ | 170,338 | | $ | 776,884 | $ | 571,839 
Operating lease liabilities | | 4,370,635 | | | 6,149,369 | | | 270,581 | | 270,641 
Long-term debt | | 3,228,449 | | | 2,303,648 | | | 3,034,048 | | 2,734,931

20. Revenue
The Company has one operating segment based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility.
Revenue is disaggregated as follows:
   
 | Year ended December 31, |

The net gain/loss on financial instruments for the years ending December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 represent non-cash gains/losses resulting from remeasurement of the fair value of convertible financial liabilities at each balance sheet date or on conversion date using the fair value option.

Each of the above referenced promissory notes and debentures included a conversion feature, exercisable at the option of the debt holder. For accounting purposes, each of these conversion features is an embedded derivative in the note or debenture. The Company elected to account for fluctuations in (a) the value of the liabilities driven by interest rate volatility and the Company’s credit risk and (b) the embedded derivatives driven by fluctuations in the Company’s common stock share price using a method known as Fair Value option. This accounting method calls for the Company to measure the fair value of the convertible financial liabilities at each balance sheet date and to record any fluctuations in the


Page | 110


  values that as non-cash adjustments relating to instrument specific credit risk in the other comprehensive income and non-cash adjustments relating to other factors in the statements of operations. If, as in the case of the liabilities described above, the debt is converted, the valuations and any adjustments are to be recorded as of the date of such conversion.

The Fair Value option also provides that the total revaluation adjustment be recorded in Common Stock and additional paid in capital thus having no impact on stockholders' equity despite the recording of the loss in the statement of operations.

[1] | In June 2019, the Company entered into a statement of work (“SOW”) with a third party for the purchase of manufacturing equipment. The SOW was initiated based on the Industrial and Regional Benefits general investment funding between the third party and the Government of Canada. The Company received the funds in two tranches after achieving two milestones as per the SOW. The funds are repayable, commencing three years from date of receipt, based on 10% of revenue from the sale of holographic film that is produced using the related manufacturing equipment paid for under this funding obligation. In June 2019, the Company achieved the first milestone and received CA$325,000 and in October 2019, the Company achieved the second milestone and received CA$975,000. The Company has not sold holographic film related to this SOW to date.

[2] | The amounts received under the agreement have been recorded at fair value by applying the effective interest rate method on the dates the funding was received, using an estimated market interest rate of 15%. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $401,186 as other income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In the year ended 2020, the Company recognized a loss of $32,291 resulting from changes in repayment period of the obligation. The gain was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company elected to bring the market interest rate to current rates and increased it to 19.17%. Following management discussions the revenue generation ability from the manufacturing equipment bought under the funding obligation was reduced, resulting in a longer repayment period. The combination of these two changes prompted the Company to recognize a gain of $471,004 for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

27. Leases
The Company entered into the following leases during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively outlined below:

On February 24, 2020, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., Torchlight Energy, Inc., and Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC timely filed their answer, affirmative defenses, and requests for disclosure. The suit, which sought monetary relief over $1 million, made unspecified allegations of misrepresentations involving a November 2015 participation agreement and a 2016 amendment to the participation agreement. Torchlight denied the allegations and asserted several affirmative defenses including but not limited to, that the suit is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, that the claims had been released, and that the claims were barred because of contractual disclaimers between sophisticated note parties. Torchlight also asserted counterclaims for attorney fees. On January 14, 2021, Goldstone Holding Company, LLC dismissed its claims without prejudice, leaving Torchlight’s counterclaims for attorney fees as the only pending claim in the case. On February 26, 2021, Torchlight filed a non-suit without prejudice on its counterclaims for attorney fees, leaving no claims in the case. The court signed a final order disposing of the entire case on March 5, 2021. However, Goldstone Holding Company, LLC asked the court to re-instate its claims, and a hearing was held on April 13, 2021.

After the suit was filed, Cordax filed a mineral lien in the amount of $104,500 against the Orogrande Field and has sued the operator and counterclaimed against Hudspeth for breach of contract, seeking the same amount as the lien. The Company has added the manufacturer of one of the tool components that the Company contends was a cause of the tool failure. It was later discovered that Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cote rdax Evaluation Technologies forfeited its charter to conduct business in the State of Texas by failing to timely pay its franchise taxes, and the Company added members of the board of directors to the case pursuant to the Texas Tax Code. It was recently disclosed that Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies is the subsidiary of a Canadian parent company, Cordax Evaluation Technologies, Inc., who has also been added to the case.

The Company’s current Chairman of the Board filed a special appearance after being served with citation, alleging that he was a Canadian citizen with no meaningful ties to Texas. After discovery was conducted on this issue, the Company filed a nonsuit without prejudice for this Defendant, dismissing him from the case. The remaining parties are currently engaged in preliminary discovery and are scheduling mediation.
    On March 18, 2021, Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies filed a lawsuit in Hudspeth County, Texas seeking to foreclose its mineral lien against the Orogrande Field in the amount of $104,500.01 and recover related attorney’s fees.

The complaint, purportedly brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s publicly traded securities from September 21, 2020 through and including December 14, 2021, asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) arising primarily from a short-seller report and statements related to the Company’s business combination with Torchlight. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.

Meta Materials Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-00463. This complaint names the same defendants and asserts the same claims on behalf of the same purported class as the Maltagliati action. The Company believes these actions (collectively, the “Securities Class Action”) have no merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.
On January 14, 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Easter District of New York captioned Hines v. Palikaras, et al., No. 1:22-cv-00248.
