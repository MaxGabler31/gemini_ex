Item 1.  Description of Business
THE COMPANY
 
Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company" or "Premier") is a multi-bank holding company and financial holding company that, as of March 5, 2019 operates eleven banking offices in Kentucky, three banking offices in Ohio, twenty-six banking offices in West Virginia, four banking offices in Washington, DC, one banking office in Maryland and three banking offices in Virginia. At December 31, 2018, Premier had total consolidated assets of $1.690 billion, total consolidated deposits of $1.430 billion and total consolidated stockholders' equity of $216.7 million. The banking subsidiaries (the "Banks" or "Affiliate Banks") consist of Citizens Deposit Bank and Trust, Inc., Vanceburg, Kentucky and Premier Bank, Inc., Huntington, West Virginia.
 
Premier was incorporated as a Kentucky corporation in 1991 and has functioned as a bank holding company since its formation. During 2002, Premier moved its principal executive offices from Georgetown, Kentucky to its present location at 2883 5th Avenue, Huntington, West Virginia, 25702. The purpose of the move was to be more centrally located among Premier's Affiliate Banks and its directorship. Premier's telephone number is (304) 525-1600.
 
Premier is a legal entity separate and distinct from its Affiliate Banks. Accordingly, the right of Premier, and thus the right of Premier's creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any of the Affiliate Banks is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries, except to the extent that claims of Premier, in its capacity as a creditor, may be recognized. The principal source of Premier's revenue is dividends from its Affiliate Banks.  See "REGULATORY MATTERS -- Dividend Restrictions" for discussion of the restrictions on the Affiliate Banks' ability to pay dividends to Premier.
 
In late 2007 Premier resumed a strategy of franchise expansion by acquiring and owning community banks.  On October 24, 2007, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Citizens First Bank, Inc. (“Citizens First”), a bank with $60 million of total assets located in Ravenswood, West Virginia.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, Premier agreed to purchase Citizens First for up to $11.7 million in stock and cash.  Each share of Citizens First common stock was entitled to merger consideration of cash and stock that generally totaled $29.25, subject to certain limitations.  Premier issued 660,000 shares of its common stock plus Premier paid $5.3 million in cash to the shareholders of Citizens First.
 
On November 27, 2007, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Traders Bankshares, Inc. (Traders), a single bank holding company with $108 million of total assets located in Spencer, West Virginia.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, Premier agreed to purchase Traders for approximately $18.1 million in stock and cash.  Each share of Traders common stock was entitled to merger consideration of $50.00 cash and 5.156 shares of Premier common stock.  Premier issued approximately 928,125 shares of its common stock plus Premier paid $9.0 million in cash to the shareholders of Traders.

On April 30, 2008, Premier closed the acquisitions of Citizens First and Traders.  On October 25, 2008, Premier merged these two new subsidiary banks together to form Traders Bank, Inc. headquartered in Ravenswood, West Virginia.  The merger was designed to consolidate management and operations of two subsidiaries in overlapping or contiguous markets.  Similarly, effective January 3, 2005, Premier merged two of its subsidiary banks, Citizens Deposit Bank & Trust in Vanceburg, Kentucky and Bank of Germantown, in Germantown, Kentucky. Bank of Germantown was merged into Citizens Deposit Bank, with its facilities continuing to operate as branches of Citizens Deposit Bank.
 
On December 31, 2008, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Abigail Adams National Bancorp, Inc. (“Abigail Adams”), a two bank holding company (Adams National Bank and Consolidated Bank & Trust Company) with $436 million of total assets at December 31, 2008 with locations in and around Washington, DC and Richmond, Virginia.  Under terms of the definitive agreement, Premier agreed to purchase Abigail Adams for approximately $10.8 million in stock.  The acquisition closed on October 1, 2009.  Each share of Abigail Adams common stock was entitled to merger consideration of 0.6134 shares of Premier common stock.  Premier issued approximately 2,124,375 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Abigail Adams.  Premier participated in the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) to help fund the rehabilitation of Adams National and provide the additional capital needed to maintain the Company’s healthy capital ratios after consummating the merger with Abigail Adams.
 
On September 10, 2010 Citizens Deposit Bank and Trust, Inc. (“Citizens Deposit”) completed its purchase of four banking offices from Integra Bank located in Maysville and Mt. Olivet, Kentucky, and Ripley and Aberdeen, Ohio.  The purchase of the branches was a strategic move to increase Citizens Deposit’s presence in its current market area without a significant increase in its operating costs. Citizens Deposit paid a $2.4 million deposit premium for the deposit liabilities it assumed and also acquired $17.8 million of branch related loans as well as $34.0 million of additional commercial real estate loans and $10.0 million of other commercial loans selected by Citizens Deposit originated from other Integra offices.  The four banking offices were also included in the branch purchase.  The purchase resulted in approximately $1.1 million of goodwill and $2.0 million in core deposit intangible.
 
On February 28, 2011, Premier received final regulatory approval to move forward with its plans to merge Boone County Bank, headquartered in Madison, West Virginia; First Central Bank, headquartered in Philippi, West Virginia; Traders Bank, Inc., headquartered in Ravenswood, West Virginia; Adams National Bank, headquartered in Washington, DC and Consolidated Bank & Trust, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, to form Premier Bank, Inc. (“Premier Bank”).  The merger was completed on April 9, 2011.  The resulting bank is headquartered in Huntington, West Virginia.

One of the goals achieved by merging the bank charters together was to alleviate the restrictions placed on the Company’s operations by written agreements previously entered into by Adams National with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (“OCC”) and Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, (“CB&T”) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, (“FRB”).  With the surrender of the Adams National charter upon consummation of the merger to form Premier Bank, Inc., the written agreement with the OCC was terminated.  Similarly, with the merger of CB&T into Premier Bank, Inc., the provisions of the written agreement with the FRB that applied to CB&T were concluded.
 
With the merger of Adams National and CB&T into Boone County Bank in the formation of Premier Bank, Abigail Adams as a corporate entity was no longer needed.  As such, it was merged into Premier on May 16, 2011.  Likewise, Premier’s other non-banking subsidiary, Mt. Vernon Financial Holdings, Inc. (“Mt. Vernon”), had completed its purpose by liquidating substantially all of a pool of loans remaining from the sale of the Bank of Mt. Vernon in 2001.  In September 2011, any remaining loans owned by Mt. Vernon were contributed as capital to Premier’s subsidiary bank, Citizens Deposit, and then on September 27, 2011, Mt. Vernon was also merged into Premier.
 
On May 13, 2010, Premier executed a six-year data processing agreement with Fidelity Information Services, Inc. and its affiliates (“FIS”) located in Jacksonville, Florida.  The agreement covers Premier’s core data processing, item processing, internet banking services, network services, customer authentication services and electronic funds transfer services.  Beginning in May 2011 and concluding in September 2011, Premier and FIS converted each of the subsidiary (or former subsidiary) bank’s systems to the FIS “Horizon” platform.  It was during this process that the data systems of the five subsidiary banks that merged to form Premier Bank, converted and combined into one system. On March 31, 2017, Premier executed a five-year extension of its data processing agreement with FIS.   The extension agreement became effective on April 1, 2017 and continues to cover Premier’s core data processing, item processing, mobile and internet banking services, network services, customer authentication services, and electronic funds transfer services.  The data processing agreement shall remain in effect until March 31, 2022 and provides for automatic five-year extensions after that date.
 
In the second quarter of 2012, Premier received the required approvals from all federal and state banking regulatory authorities to merge three of its subsidiary banks.  On August 17, 2012, Premier merged Ohio River Bank, headquartered in Ironton, Ohio and Farmers Deposit Bank, headquartered in Eminence, Kentucky with and into Premier’s wholly owned subsidiary Citizens Deposit Bank & Trust, headquartered in Vanceburg, Kentucky.

Effective with the close of business on April 4, 2014, Premier completed its purchase of the Bank of Gassaway (“Gassaway”), a $201.52 million bank headquartered in Gassaway, West Virginia.  Under terms of an amended and restated agreement of merger dated January 3, 2014, Premier Bank, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Premier, paid $20.25 million in cash for the Bank of Gassaway and merged Gassaway’s five branch locations into its operating systems.  The resulting merger expanded Premier Bank’s footprint into central West Virginia along the I-79 corridor.
 
On June 12, 2014, Citizens Deposit opened a de novo branch in Fort Wright, Kentucky in the southern Cincinnati, Ohio metro area in an effort to expand the bank’s operations into a more urban market.  On June 13, 2015, Citizens Deposit closed its Aberdeen and South Webster, Ohio branches in a strategic move to reduce its cost structure.  On August 3, 2015, Citizens Deposit opened a de novo branch in Florence, Kentucky, its second de novo branch in the southern Cincinnati, Ohio metro area.   In 2018, Citizens Deposit opened two de novo branches.  On April 9, 2018, Citizens Deposit completed the purchase of a branch building in Huntington, West Virginia and began operating the facility as a full service bank branch.   On December 17, 2018, Citizens Deposit opened a full service bank branch in Cold Spring, Kentucky, its third branch location in the southern Cincinnati, Ohio metro area.  These branch transactions are part of a strategic effort to position the bank as a strong community bank, with a low cost structure and a high opportunity for profitable loans in expanding markets along the Ohio River.
 
On July 6, 2015, Premier and First National Bankshares Corporation (“Bankshares”), a $245 million single bank holding company (as of December 31, 2015) headquartered in Ronceverte, West Virginia jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement of merger.  Under terms of the definitive agreement of merger, each share of Bankshares common stock was entitled to merger consideration of 2.324 shares of Premier common stock.  Premier issued approximately 1,935,300 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Bankshares valued at approximately $22.0 million.
 
Effective with the close of business on March 4, 2016, Premier merged its newly acquired wholly owned subsidiary First National Bank (“First National”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bankshares, with and into its wholly owned subsidiary Premier Bank, Inc.  The resulting merger expanded Premier Bank’s footprint into the Greenbrier Valley of West Virginia and into Covington, Virginia along Interstate 64 with six branch locations.
 
Premier elected to become a financial holding company effective October 5, 2017.  For further information on financial holding companies see Regulatory Matters - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act below.

BUSINESS
 General
 
Through the Banks the Company focuses on providing quality community banking services to individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses. By seeking to provide such banking services in non-urban areas, the Company believes that it can minimize the competitive effect of larger financial institutions that typically are focused on large metropolitan areas. Where the Company owns branches in urban areas, such as the Washington, DC Metro Area, Richmond, Virginia and the Cincinnati, Ohio Metro Area, the Company believes the nimble nature of its operations and local decision making process allow it to compete effectively with larger financial institutions.  Each Bank retains its local management structure which offers customers direct access to the Bank's president or regional president and other officers in an environment conducive to friendly, informed and courteous service. This approach also enables each Bank to offer local and timely decision-making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures and credit policies limited only by a framework of centralized risk controls provided by the Company to promote prudent banking practices. See additional discussion under "Regulatory Matters" below.
 
Each Bank maintains its community orientation by, among other things, having selected members of its community as members of its board of directors, who assist in the introduction of prospective customers to the Bank and in the development or modification of products and services to meet customer needs. As a result of the development of personal banking relationships with its customers and the convenience and service offered by the Banks, the Banks' lending and investing activities are funded primarily by core deposits.
 
When appropriate and economically advantageous, the Company centralizes certain of the Banks' back office, support and investment functions in order to achieve consistency and cost efficiency in the delivery of products and services. The Company centrally provides services such as accounting, loan review, information technology operations and network support, human resources, compliance and internal auditing to the Banks to enhance their ability to compete effectively. The Company also provides overall direction in the areas of credit policy and administration, strategic planning, marketing, investment portfolio management, and other financial and administrative services. Each Bank participates in product development by advising management of new products and services needed by its customers and desirable changes to existing products and services.  Company senior management along with each Bank's management periodically review and standardize their offering of products and services, although pricing decisions remain at the local level.
 
The Company utilizes an external third party provider for its core data processing systems.  As a result, the Company through the Banks is able offer more modern products, such as internet banking, mobile banking and check imaging, plus is able to take advantage of modern technologies such as image exchange to remit and clear items with its exchange agents. The Company has also integrated its automated teller machine network, improved its management reporting systems, adopted an integrated image-based document storage system, and offers mobile banking via smart phones and other hand held computing devices.

Each of the Banks provides a wide range of retail and commercial banking services, including commercial, real estate, agricultural and consumer lending; depository and funds transfer services; collections; safe deposit boxes; cash management services; and other services tailored for both individuals and businesses.
 
The Banks' residential mortgage lending activities consist primarily of loans for purchasing personal residences or loans for commercial or consumer purposes secured by residential mortgages.  The Banks typically only retain mortgage loans with variable interest rate terms due to the longer amortization periods associated with mortgage lending.  For customers who desire fixed rate mortgage terms, the Banks take customer applications for a third party mortgage vendor, and in turn receive a commission for their services.  The Banks’ mortgage originators are salaried employees who do not receive a commission or other incentive compensation for the number or type of mortgages they originate.  Consumer lending activities consist of traditional forms of financing for automobile and personal loans including unsecured lines of credit. Commercial lending activities include loans to small to medium-sized businesses located primarily in the communities in which the Banks have branch locations and surrounding areas. Commercial loans are generally secured by business assets including real estate, equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. Some commercial loans are unsecured.  The branches located in larger metro areas, such as Washington DC, Richmond Virginia, and Cincinnati Ohio, also offer opportunities for larger commercial and commercial real estate loans.  These opportunities are subject to Premier’s strict credit underwriting policies and procedures.
 
The Banks' range of deposit services includes checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, club accounts, individual retirement accounts, certificates of deposit and overdraft protection. Customers can access their accounts via traditional bank branch locations as well as Automated Teller Machines (ATM’s) and the internet either via personal computers or mobile computing devices such as smart phones.  The Banks also offer bill payment, remote deposits via image capture devices and mobile computing devices, person to person payments via mobile computing devices, and telephone banking services.  Deposits of the Banks are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC to the maximum amounts offered by the FDIC.

Competition
 
The Banks encounter strong competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. The widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi-bank holding companies as well as the availability of nationwide interstate banking and internet banking have created a highly competitive environment for financial services providers. In one or more aspects of its business, each Bank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, electronic payment facilitators, software companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries operating in its market and elsewhere, many of which have substantially greater financial and managerial resources. While the Banks are smaller financial institutions by comparison, each of the Banks' competitors include large bank holding companies having substantially greater resources and offering certain services that the Affiliate Banks may not currently provide. Each Bank seeks to minimize the competitive effect of larger organizations through a community banking approach that emphasizes direct customer access to the Bank's regional presidents and other officers in an environment conducive to friendly, informed and courteous service.  Furthermore, via the Company’s credit administration department, the Banks can also minimize the competitive effects of larger organizations by tailoring their lending criteria to the individual circumstances of the small-to-medium sized business owner.
 
Management believes that each Bank is positioned to compete successfully in its respective primary market area, although no assurances as to ongoing competitiveness can be given. Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, service charges on deposit accounts for various services related to customer convenience, interest rates charged on loans and other credit, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of the banking facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Management believes that the commitment of its Banks to personal service, innovation and involvement in their respective communities and primary market areas, as well as their commitment to quality community banking service, are factors that contribute to their competitiveness.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
The following discussion sets forth certain elements of the regulatory framework applicable to financial holding companies, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information relevant to Premier. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds and not for the protection of the holders of securities, including Premier’s common shares. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions. A change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Premier or its subsidiaries may have a material effect on the business of Premier.

General - As a bank holding company and financial holding company, Premier is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHC Act"), and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"). Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies generally may not acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all the assets of any company, including a bank, without the Federal Reserve's prior approval. Similarly, bank holding companies generally may not acquire ownership or control of a savings association without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Further, branching by the Affiliate Banks is subject to the jurisdiction, and requires the approval of each Affiliate Bank's primary federal banking regulator and, if the Affiliate Bank is a state-chartered bank, the appropriate state banking regulator.
 
Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve's determination that such activity or control constitutes a risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. Premier and the Affiliate Banks are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which limits borrowings by Premier (and any nonbank subsidiaries) from the Affiliate Banks and also limits various other transactions between Premier (and any nonbank subsidiaries) and the Affiliate Banks.
 
Citizens Deposit Bank and Trust, Inc. is chartered in Kentucky and supervised, regulated and examined by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.  Premier Bank, Inc. is chartered in West Virginia and supervised, regulated and examined by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions.  In addition, the Affiliate Banks are supervised and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). Each banking regulator has the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders if it determines that the activities of a bank regularly represent an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of law.
 
Both federal and state law extensively regulates various aspects of the banking business, such as loan loss reserve and capital requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosure, mortgage origination disclosures and ability to repay requirements, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Premier and the Affiliate Banks are also affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the Federal Reserve and by various other governmental laws, regulations and requirements. Further, the earnings of Premier and Affiliate Banks are affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates. Legislation and administrative actions affecting the banking industry are frequently considered by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether such legislation or administrative actions will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry, in general, or Premier and the Affiliate Banks, in particular, would be affected.

Liability for Bank Subsidiaries - The Federal Reserve has a policy to the effect that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to maintain resources adequate to support each such subsidiary bank.  This support may be required at times when Premier may not have the resources to provide it. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 
Any depository institution insured by the FDIC may be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution, or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. "Default" is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and "in danger of default" is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a "default" is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. In the event that such a default occurred with respect to a bank, any loans to the bank from its parent holding company will be subordinate in right of payment of the bank's depositors and certain of its other obligations.
 
Capital Requirements - Premier is subject to capital ratios, requirements and guidelines imposed by the Federal Reserve, which are substantially similar to the ratios, requirements and guidelines imposed by the FDIC on the Banks. These capital requirements establish higher capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that assume greater credit risks. For this purpose, a bank's or holding company's assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments are assigned to risk categories, each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments. A bank's or holding company's capital is divided into two tiers: "Tier 1" capital and "Tier 2" capital. "Tier 1" capital includes common stockholders' equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus (excluding auction rate issues), minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and Trust Preferred Securities both of which are subject to certain limitations. Goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets are subtracted from these sources of capital to calculate Tier 1 capital. "Tier 2" capital includes, among other items, perpetual preferred stock not meeting the Tier 1 definition, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less certain required deductions.  Effective January 1 2015, bank and bank holding company regulatory agencies adopted rules defining a subset of Tier 1 capital referred to as “Common Equity Tier 1” capital, or “CET1” capital, in accordance with the Basil III accord.  CET1 capital includes only the common stockholders’ equity of the entity before deducting elements such as goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets.  Prior to the acquisition of Bankshares, Premier’s CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital were identical because all of Premier’s Tier 1 capital was common shareholders’ equity.  In conjunction with the acquisition of Bankshares on January 15, 2016, Premier assumed $6.0 million of Trust Preferred Securities held by Bankshares which are eligible for inclusion in Premier’s Tier 1 capital but are excluded from its CET1 capital.

Bank holding companies currently are required to maintain CET1 capital, Tier I capital and total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) equal to at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0% of total risk-weighted assets, respectively. At December 31, 2018, Premier met all requirements, with CET1 capital equal to 14.2% of its total risk-weighted assets, Tier I capital equal to 14.7% of its total risk-weighted assets and total capital equal to 15.9% of its total risk-weighted assets.  Prior to 2015, the minimum Tier I capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio was 4.0%.
 
In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum "leverage ratio" (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) of 3.0%, if the holding company has the highest regulatory ratings for risk-based capital purposes. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3.0% plus at least 100 to 200 basis points. At December 31, 2018, Premier's leverage ratio was 10.7%.
 
The foregoing capital requirements are minimum requirements. The Federal Reserve may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described above for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels.
 
Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), among other things, identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for "prompt corrective action" for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements.
 
An "undercapitalized" bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee the bank's compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5% of the Bank's assets at the time it became "undercapitalized" or the amount needed to comply with the plan.  Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent's general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.

Capital Requirements and Phase-in of Capital Buffer – Beginning on January 1, 2015, the standard for minimum regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio the Banks must maintain in order to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action increased from 6.00% to 8.00%.  As shown in the table in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements regarding stockholders’ equity, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of the banks at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 exceed the new standard.  Also beginning on January 1, 2015, a new measure of capital adequacy has been added for the Banks to be considered well capitalized.  The Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio, or CET1 Ratio, restricts the capital to be included in the ratio to common stockholders’ equity and requires a minimum ratio of 6.50% of risk-weighted assets for a bank to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  The equity of both of Premier’s subsidiary banks are already 100% common stockholders’ equity and therefore there was no adverse impact from the implementation of the new capital ratio.
 
Beginning on January 1, 2016 an additional capital conservation buffer was added to the minimum regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  The capital conservation buffer is measured as a percentage of risk weighted assets and is being phased-in over the four year period from 2016 thru 2019.  When fully implemented in 2019, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.50% of risk weighted assets over and above the regulatory minimum capital ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) to risk weighted assets, Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets, and Total Capital to risk weighted assets.  The consequences of not meeting the capital conservation buffer thresholds include restrictions on the payment of dividends, restrictions on the payment of discretionary bonuses, and restrictions on the repurchasing of common shares by the Company.  As shown in the table in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements regarding stockholders’ equity, the capital ratios of the Affiliate Banks and the Company already exceed the new minimum capital ratios plus the fully phased-in 2.50% capital buffer requiring a CET1 Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least 7.00%, a Tier 1 Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least 8.50% and a Total Capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least 10.50%.  The Company’s capital conservation buffer at December 31, 2018 was 7.88% and at December 31, 2017 was 7.56%, both well in excess of the fully phased-in 2.50% required by January 1, 2019.
 
Dividend Restrictions - Premier is dependent on dividends from its Affiliate Banks for its revenues. Various federal and state regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Affiliate Banks can pay to Premier without regulatory approval. At December 31, 2018, approximately $8.4 million of the total stockholders' equity of the Affiliate Banks was available for payment of dividends to Premier without approval by the applicable regulatory authority.

In addition, federal bank regulatory authorities have authority to prohibit Premier's Affiliate Banks from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their business. The payment of dividends, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Affiliate Banks to pay dividends in the future is presently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines as well as each Affiliate Bank's earnings and financial condition.  Additional information regarding dividend limitations can be found in Note 21 of the consolidated financial statements.
 
Interstate Banking - Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the "Riegle-Neal Act"), subject to certain concentration limits, (i) bank holding companies, such as Premier, are permitted to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any state of the United States, subject to certain restrictions, and (ii) banks are permitted to acquire branch offices outside their home state by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states or establishing de novo branch offices in other states; provided that, in the case of any such purchase or opening of individual branches, the host state has adopted legislation "opting in" to the relevant provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act; and provided further, that, in the case of a merger with a bank located in another state, the host state has not adopted legislation "opting out" of the relevant provisions of the Riegle-Neal Act.
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act - On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "Act") was signed into law, eliminating many of the remaining barriers to full convergence of the banking, securities, and insurance industries. The major provisions of the Act took effect  March 12, 2000.
 
The Act enables a broad-scale consolidation among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies by creating a new type of financial services company called a "financial holding company," a bank holding company with dramatically expanded powers. Financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. In addition, the Act permits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies, but only if they jointly determine that such activities are "financial in nature" or "complementary to financial activities."  Premier elected to become a financial holding company effective October 5, 2017.
 
The Federal Reserve serves as the primary "umbrella" regulator of financial holding companies, with jurisdiction over the parent company and more limited oversight over its subsidiaries. The primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company depends on the activities conducted by the subsidiary. A financial holding company need not obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to engaging, either de novo or through acquisitions, in financial activities previously determined to be permissible by the Federal Reserve. Instead, a financial holding company need only provide notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after commencing the new activity or consummating the acquisition.

Some aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to future rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on Premier, its customers or the financial services industry as a whole.  In many cases, regulatory or other governmental agencies already have taken action to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act’s mandates, and may take further action to comply with or modify the Dodd-Frank Act’s mandates.
