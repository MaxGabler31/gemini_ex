ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

Ainos Inc., formerly Amarillo Biosciences, Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”), is engaged in developing medical technologies for point-of-care (“POCT”) testing and safe and novel medical treatment for a broad range of disease indications. Since our inception in 1984, we have concentrated our resources on business planning, raising capital, research and clinical development activities for our programs, securing related intellectual property and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics using low-dose non-injectable interferon (“IFN”). In addition to our core IFN technology, we are committed to developing a diversified healthcare business portfolio to include medical devices and consumer healthcare products. 

Although we have historically been involved in extensive pharmaceutical research and development of low-dose oral interferon as a therapeutic, we are prioritizing the commercialization of medical devices as part of our diversification strategy. Since the beginning of 2021, we have acquired significant intellectual property from our majority shareholder, Ainos KY, to expand our potential product portfolio into Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOC”) and COVID-19 POCTs. This includes 51 issued and pending patents related to VOC technologies and 3 issued patents for COVID-19 POCT products. We expect our underlying intellectual property to enable us to expedite the commercialization of our medical device pipeline, beginning with Ainos-branded COVID-19 POCT product candidates. 

Medtech Solutions

Our portfolio of medtech solutions is currently comprised of the following: 


· | COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kit and Ainos’ Cloud-based Test Management Apps. Our cloud-based test management platform is comprised of an antigen rapid test kit, a personal application, or app, and an enterprise app. We anticipate our management apps will allow individuals and organizations to seamlessly manage tests, trace infections, and share results. As the first commercialized COVID-19 product we sell, we currently market the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit in Taiwan under emergency use authorization (“EUA”) issued by the Taiwan Federal and Drug Administration (“TFDA”) in 2021. We market the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit under our brand name. The kit is manufactured by TCNT, our product co-developer. See “Part I, Item 1 - Strategic Investment and Business Development with Ainos KY”. We expect TCNT to apply for EUA authorization from the U.S. FDA (“FDA”) in mid-2022 and, if a EUA is issued by the FDA, we intend to market this product in the U.S.

· | COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Test. Our solution consists of a color-changing assay that is compatible with standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) machines and delivers test results within 40 minutes, faster than a typical PCR test turnaround time of a few hours to several days. In addition to our assay’s compatibility with existing PCR equipment, we will also offer portable, low-cost test equipment intended to help medical professionals quickly scale testing capacity. We will market the product under the Ainos brand name, and our co-developer TCNT will manufacture the product. See “Part I, Item 1 - Strategic Investment and Business Development with Ainos KY.” The product is currently under EUA review by the TFDA and we expect TCNT to submit for EUA review by the FDA in mid-2022.

· | VOC POCT – Ainos Flora. Our Ainos Flora device will perform a non-invasive test for female vaginal health and certain sexually transmitted diseases (“STDs”) including vaginitis, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis, within a few minutes. We expect Ainos Flora will provide convenient, discreet, rapid testing in a point-of-care setting which will allow women to self-test at home. We are conducting clinical trials in Taiwan and plan to seek TFDA approval for marketing in Taiwan and FDA 510(k) clearance for marketing in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2022. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | VOC POCT – Ainos Pen. Our Ainos Pen device is a cloud-connected, multi-purpose, portable breath analyzer that is intended to monitor health conditions including oral, gastrointestinal, liver, and renal health within minutes. We expect consumers to be empowered to share their self-test results with their physicians through in-person and telehealth medical consultations. We intend to explore commercialization opportunities with third-party technology and manufacturing collaborators as a non-medical, consumer device in the second quarter of 2022. 
· | VOC POCT – CHS430. The CHS430 device is intended to provide non-invasive testing for ventilator-associated pneumonia within 10 minutes, as compared to current standard of care invasive culture tests that typically take more than two days to provide results. We plan to be the exclusive sales agent for CHS430, pursuant to our Product Development Agreement with our co-developer, TCNT, who will manufacture the product. We intend to collaborate with TCNT to conduct clinical trials in Taiwan, after which we expect TCNT to submit applications for TFDA approval for marketing in Taiwan and FDA 510(k) clearance for marketing in the U.S. in 2023. 
· | Very Low-Dose Oral Interferon Alpha (“VELDONA”). VELDONA is a low-dose oral interferon alpha (“IFN-α”) formulation based on our nearly four decades of research on IFN-α’s broad treatment applications. We recently initiated a strategic relationship with InnoPharmax, Inc. to jointly develop and market an orally administered cytotoxin-induced complementary combined therapy (“CICCT”) for the treatment of COVID-19 and other potential viral infections. We plan to initiate Phase 2/3 clinical trials for our CICCT treatment in the second quarter of 2022 in Taiwan. We also plan to advance our VELDONA development efforts for disease indications such as thrombocytopenia and Sjögren’s syndrome in 2023.
· | Synthetic RNA (“SRNA”). We are developing a SRNA technology platform in Taiwan. Our initial focus is to develop a potential COVID-19 mRNA vaccine platform using the full-length spike or the RBD gene sequence of the alpha and delta variants as reference sequences. We plan to continue developing these technologies with the goal of initiating clinical trials in Taiwan in 2023. 


An integral part of our operating strategy is to create multiple revenue streams through commercializing our product portfolio and leveraging our intellectual property patents, including potentially out-licensing or forming strategic relationships to develop our medical devices, consumer healthcare products and low-dose interferon therapeutics. 

In 2022, we are prioritizing the commercialization of our POCT devices, beginning with seeking EUA authorizations for the COVID-19 POCT product candidates and plans to commercialize our other POCT product candidates. As a general strategy, we plan to conduct clinical trials in Taiwan and use the data to apply for TFDA approval and FDA clearance via the 510(k) or comparable pathway. If our products are approved, we plan to work with third-party distributors to market our products in countries where we receive regulatory approval and to seek various business relationships with other medtech companies to market our products. At the same time, we plan to initiate clinical trials for the CICCT and SRNA programs over the course of this year.

Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on further successful development and commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. We anticipate our POCT products candidates to potentially generate organic cash flows to support our business while we invest in our other pipeline projects. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the next few years as we advance our product candidates through preclinical development, clinical trials and regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, and legal and regulatory compliance. We may also incur expenses in connection with strategic relationships for the development of additional product candidates. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses.

Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations with business revenues and proceeds from external sources. We may pursue additional funding that may include our entry into or expansion of borrowing arrangements; research and development incentive payments, government grants, co-financing from pharmaceutical companies and other corporate sources; and potential future collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies or other third parties. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization, potential in-licenses or acquisitions plans for one or more of our product candidates.

We are unable to predict the timing or amount of unexpected expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and related legal regulatory requirements. When we are eventually able to generate additional product sales, those sales may not be sufficient to become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 

As of December 31, 2021, we had available cash and cash equivalents of 1,751,499. We anticipate business revenues and further potential financial support from outside sources to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See “Part II, Item 7 - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. To finance our continuing operations, we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured.

Strategic Investment and Business Development with Ainos KY 

In order to facilitate our diversification strategy through development and commercialization of an expanded base of product offerings we secured a strategic investor, Ainos KY. In December 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, on April 15, 2021, in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, we acquired intellectual property assets from Ainos KY valued at approximately $20,000,000. Through this relationship, we have implemented several strategic initiatives over the past year to augment our product development pipeline and achieve a strengthened financial position. The foregoing description of the Securities Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which was filed with the SEC on December 30, 2020 as Exhibit 2.1 in our Form 8-K, is attached as Exhibit 10(i) to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by this reference. A copy of our Form 8-K reporting the closing of the SPA transaction filed on April 21, 2021 with the SEC is attached hereto as Exhibit 10(ii) and is incorporated herein by this reference.

The following are highlights of recent major corporate milestones that we believe will serve as catalysts for us to develop and commercialize a multi-faceted product portfolio pipeline over the next several years: 


· | On June 14, 2021, we became the master sales and marketing agent for the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit and Ainos nucleic acid test kit under a Sales and Marketing Agreement by and between our Company and Ainos KY effective May 28, 2020 to May 27, 2025, respectively. Under the Agreement we are authorized to sell and market the products in Taiwan, designate third-party distributors, and are entitled to 60% profit share on net results of such sales after costs. The foregoing description of the Sales and Marketing Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10(iii) to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by this reference.

· | On November 18, 2021, Ainos KY agreed to increase its strategic investment to further bolster our POCT business through an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired additional intellectual property and equipment assets valued at approximately $26,000,000 including technical know-how, medical device manufacturing, testing and office equipment in Taiwan and hired certain of Ainos KY’s R&D personnel. As payment for the assets, in January 2022, we issued to Ainos KY a non-interest bearing Convertible Note in the principal amount of $26,000,000. See “– Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. The foregoing description of the Asset Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which was filed with the SEC on November 22, 2022 as Exhibit 2.1 in our Form 8-K, is attached as Exhibit 10(iv) to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by this reference.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business 

The COVID-19 pandemic presented us an opportunity to grow our business in 2021. We began selling and recording product revenue for Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in June 2021 after TCNT obtained TFDA EUA in the same month. Between June and December 2021, we generated $568,164 of revenues from the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit. 

In 2021, substantially all of our operating revenue came from the sale of the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits in Taiwan. COVID-19 infection rates have been well controlled in Taiwan. According to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (“Taiwan CDC”), total cases in Taiwan were just 17,029 as of December 31, 2021. Over the same period, total cases in the U.S. were around 54,800,000. As a result, the total revenues we generated from our Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits were fewer than we had anticipated. We intend to broaden our market reach if TCNT successfully obtains regulatory clearance in the U.S. or other countries. 

We believe affordable, easy-to-use, rapid COVID-19 testing will continue to be in demand at least in the short-term. We anticipate our management apps, when used with the Ainos antigen rapid test kit, will allow individuals and organizations to effectively manage tests, trace infections, and share results. We also anticipate the Ainos COVID-19 nucleic acid test can help medical professionals quickly scale testing capacity if the product receives regulatory clearance.

We are continuing to monitor the potential impact of the pandemic, but we cannot be certain the future impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Depending on developments relating to the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, the pandemic may affect our ability to initiate and complete research studies, delay the initiation of our future research studies, disrupt regulatory activities or have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights

The Company has built an extensive patent portfolio of intellectual property consisting of patents related to VOC technologies, POCT products, and low-dose orally administered interferon that encompass method of use or treatment, and/or composition of matter and manufacturing. The Company presently owns a total of 62 patents, of which 43 are active patents and 19 are pending patent approval as more particularly described in Exhibit 99(i) attached hereto and incorporated by this reference.

There are no current patent litigation proceedings involving the Company.

Government Regulation

Regulation of Medical Devices in Taiwan

Our product candidates and operations are subject to the Taiwan Medical Devices Act and its implementation regulations (collectively the “Taiwan MDA”), which govern the development, design, pre-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Under the Taiwan MDA, medical devices, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, will be subject to differentiated level of review and examination of TFDA before marketing the device. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device requires either (a) an approval granted by TFDA or (b) a registration with TFDA before launching distribution or marketing in Taiwan. The latter is a simplified premarket review process applicable to some medical devices classified as “lower risk level” items listed in the TFDA announcement. Our product candidates are not on the list of “lower risk level” and the approval of TFDA will be required for us to launch distribution or marketing of such products in Taiwan.

Additionally, the TFDA may grant emergency use authorizations (“EUA”) to allow commercial distribution of medical devices intended to address the public health emergency during public emergencies. The TFDA needs to assess the potential effectiveness of such medical device on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis and will require the submission of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The TFDA also may revise or revoke an issued EUA if the circumstances justifying such granting no longer exist, the criteria for its granting of EUA are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. We were issued with a EUA from TFDA for distribution of our Ainos SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Kit on June 7, 2021. 

Concerning the post-marketing regulatory requirements apply, a company engaging in medical devices business will be required to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process and report to FDA when the device it markets has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. The FDA also has broad discretion to take compliance and enforcement actions, such as requiring a safety surveillance report to be submitted regularly for review, ordering corrections, and conducting on-site inspection if it has any regulatory concerns. Failure to comply with applicable requirements under the MDA may subject a device and/or manufacturers, including us, to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as the TFDA’s refusal to approve pending premarket applications, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, business suspension or license/listing cancellation, administrative fines up to NT$50,000,000, product seizures and destruction, civil monetary penalties and/or criminal prosecution and criminal penalties up to NT$50,000,000. Any company engaging in medical devices business may be additionally subject to ten times the criminal fines for each violation made by its authorized representative and/or employees.

Personal Data Protection Laws in Taiwan

Under the Taiwan Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”), each individual or governmental or non-governmental agencies, including our affiliate in Taiwan, should be subject to certain requirements and restrictions for collecting, processing or using personal data. The definition of “personal data” is extended to cover a broad scope, including name, birthday, ID, special features, fingerprints, marriage status, family, education, occupation, medical records, medical history, genetic information, sex life, health examination report, criminal records, contact information, financial status, social activities, and any other data which is sufficient to directly or indirectly identify a specific person. Due to the nature of the use of medical devices, our operation and the operation of our partners might collect, process, or use the data pertaining to a person’s medical records and healthcare, genetics (collectively, sensitive data), which is subject to stricter scrutiny. Generally, we can only obtain such sensitive data when the person consents in writing or electronically. Furthermore, in September 2021, the TFDA published the draft bill of Regulations Governing Security Measures of the Personal Information File for the Business of Wholesale of Medical Devices and Retail Sale of Medical Apparatus authorized under the PDPA, which requires the medical devices wholesalers and retailers to adopt necessary data security/protection measures, and establish prevention and reporting mechanisms in relation to any data breach. The draft bill also empowers the TFDA to conduct regular inspections and audits. If we fail to comply with the PDPA, we may be subject to serious punishment for civil claims, criminal offenses and administrative liabilities: the ceiling of the aggregate compensation amount for damages payable in a single case will be up to NT$200,000,000 or the actual value of loss arising from our violation provided the amount of actual value of such loss is higher than NT$200,000,000; the defendant may be subject to an imprisonment of up to five years; and the penalty for administrative liabilities will be up to NT$500,000 for each violation, and may be imposed consecutively if such violation continues.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States

Our product candidates and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and its implementing regulations, collectively referred to as the FDCA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance.

The FDA regulates the development, design, pre-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending premarket applications, issuance of warning letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.

FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, or grant of a de novo request for classification. During public emergencies, FDA also may grant emergency use authorizations to allow commercial distribution of devices intended to address the public health emergency. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. 

Class I devices include those with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices. Some Class I or low risk devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.

Class II devices are moderate risk devices that require premarket review and clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarketing requirements.

Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device following a 510(k) submission. Submission and FDA approval of a PMA application is required before marketing of a Class III device. As with 510(k) submissions, unless an exemption applies, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. 

Emergency Use Authorization

In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.

Under this authority, the FDA may issue an EUA for an unapproved device if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence of effectiveness of the device exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the disease or condition.

Once issued, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product.

The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.

On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19. On February 4, 2020, HHS determined that COVID-19 represents a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and, subsequently, declared on March 24, 2020, that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices, during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any authorization as issued by the FDA. On February 29, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance with policy specific to development of in vitro point-of-care tests during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This guidance was updated on March 16, 2020, May 4, 2020 and May 11, 2020. We received an EUA from the FDA for the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit on November 17, 2020.

510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway

Our current products are class II and, but for the immediate ability to seek an EUA, would be subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a 510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 calendar days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance may take and often takes longer. Upon review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2020, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification application is $11,594.

Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information within 180 days before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission.

If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, that the device has a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) submission is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that needs to be provided so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) submission should the original 510(k) submission have been withdrawn.

After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) submission is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. The FDA requested public feedback on whether it should consider certain actions that might require new authority, such as whether to sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.


8

PMA Approval Pathway

A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Review may take anywhere from 180 days to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.

The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions, it may also condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.

None of our test kits are currently approved under a PMA, nor are we currently seeking approval under a PMA for the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit. However, we may in the future develop devices which will require the approval of a PMA.

De novo Classification

Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To market low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a de novo down-classification on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. In the event the FDA determines the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request for classification. When the FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and further can serve as a predicate for future devices of that type, through a 510(k) premarket notification.

We are not currently seeking a de novo classification for the Ainos COVID-19 antigen rapid test kit or any device in development. 

Clinical Trials

Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA, oftentimes for a de novo request for classification, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. The clinical trials must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA.

If the device is considered a ”non-significant risk,” IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. After a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons.

Post-market Regulation

After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:


· | Establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers and contract manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
· | Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; 
· | Clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 


9


· | Medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 


The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:


· | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds; 
· | recall, withdrawal, administrative detention, or seizure of our test kits; 
· | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
· | refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new test kits or modified test kits;
· | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; 
· | refusal to grant export approval for our test kits; or 
· | criminal prosecution. 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

We are subject to compliance with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Healthcare Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HIPAA, among other things, established federal protection for the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. The HIPAA privacy regulations protect PHI by limiting its use and disclosure, giving patients the right to access certain information about them, and limiting most disclosures of PHI to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. 

In addition, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy and security laws and regulations. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely, and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely.

Failure to comply with HIPAA, Healthcare Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 or their implementing regulations, and similar state laws, may result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

U.S. Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws

The U.S. federal and state governments have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to address fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws.

Anti-Kickback Statutes

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare products or services reimbursed by any source, not only government healthcare programs, and may apply to payments made directly by the patient.

Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.

Federal False Claims Laws

The FCA prohibits any person or entity, among other things, to knowingly present, or cause to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the FCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not only a federal healthcare program.

Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages and significant mandatory penalties, civil monetary penalties, and violators may be subject to exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many medical device manufacturers and healthcare companies have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government for a variety of alleged improper activities and have entered into corporate integrity agreements with OIG, under which the companies undertake certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations, to avoid exclusion from federal health care program. 

Our activities, including those relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our test kits (once approved) and the sale and marketing of our test kits (once approved), may be subject to scrutiny under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA. We are also subject to other criminal federal laws that prohibit making false or fictitious claims and false statements to the federal government.

HIPAA Fraud Statute

HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
Open Payments

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians, and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information and transfers of value provided (beginning in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to submit timely, accurate and complete reports may result in substantial monetary penalties. We are subject to the Open Payments Program and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring them to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

U.S. Health Reform

Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products once approved. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our test kits profitably once approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our test kits once approved. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our test kits once approved.

The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs and potentially affect individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors.
