Primary Products
 
Our primary products include Polymer Osteosynthesis Devices made of a proprietary material compositing of polyamide 6 (PA6), hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly(methyl methacrylate-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone) (P(MMA-co-NVP)). These advanced materials are used in surgical screws, binding wires, rods and related medical devices for the treatment of orthopedic trauma, sports-related medical treatment, cartilage repair, and related treatments, and reconstructive dental procedures. Our polymer orthopaedic internal fixation screws received approval from the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) in April 2018; and our PA Binding Wires are under clinical trials; and our PA Mini-Screws are under animal test.
Product Characteristics:
 
The Company’s new and unique material has ideal mechanical properties with similar strength, toughness, tensile strength and flexibility etc. to the human bone. Its elasticity, toughness and high fatigue resistance can effectively stabilize fractures without causing stress shielding. Its strong biocompatibility includes: no inflammation, no pyrogen, no cytotoxicity, no subchronic systemic toxicity etc. Additionally, the biomaterials promotes the synthesis of matrix mature protein (ALP, collagen I, osteopontin, osteocalcin) gene expressions, via local transcription factors of osterix, Runx2 mRNA for a long time. Facilitating the continuous synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins required for cell mineralization, and bone tissue regeneration from an effective bio-interface integration.
 
The bone screw products produced by the materials have been proved to be safe and reliable after clinical trials and long-term follow-ups spanning 10 years. Unlike metallic screws, they can be implanted for a long time without the need for a secondary removal surgery. Our biomedical composite material exhibit three key technological innovations:
 

1. | A notably reduced need for a secondary surgery to remove implant due to post-operative complications, therefore avoiding unnecessary risk and expense on all patient care; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Enhancing the performance of the materials by manufacturing them to be easily fitted to each patient, forming an exact fit; 
3. | Improving the biological activity of materials. Clinical trial results have shown that PA implants promote a progressive shift of load to the new bone creating micro-motion and thereby avoiding bone atrophy due to ‘stress shielding’; 
4. | Reducing the chance of post-operative infection; 
5. | Stimulate bone tissues to facilitate effective biological integration, benefitting the regeneration of bone; 
6. | Ease of post-operative care i.e. no distortion during x-ray imaging; 
7. | Simple and cost-effective to manufacture. 

 
The Company has developed six proprietary polymer fixation implant product lines, including screws, pins, tacks, rods and binding wires, which provide an alternative to metal implants and overcome the limitations of first generation re-absorbable fixation devices. The Company’s product range will ultimately cover the full gamut of components for implantation, including human orthopedic and dental applications, as well as veterinary applications.
 
Industry Development
 
The fracture fixation industry has developed through three generations of materials science:
 
The first generation internal-fracture fixation material:
 
The first generation internal-fracture-fixer components are usually made of stainless steel, titanium and alloy. Due to their high intensity, low costs and easy machining character, these components have achieved huge success in fracture treatment and remain the most widely used internal-fracture-fixer material. However, their prominent flaws are the huge difference between metal’s elasticity co-efficient, easily causing second-time bone fracture. The metallic ion can also cause tissue inflammation, and the need of a secondary surgery to have them taken out. These flaws stimulated the development of the degradable macromolecule material.
 
The second generation fracture fixation material:
 
The second generation bone-fracture-fixed components are made of degradable macromolecule material, such as PLLA, PGA and PDS, etc. The disadvantage of these components is rapid self-degeneration in early stages after the initial implant. For example, the strength of SR-PLLA decreases to 10-20Mpa after 4 weeks of implantation. Therefore, the second generation bone-fracture-fixed components can be only used to treat substantial spongiosa bone fractures.
 
The third generation fracture fixation material:
 
The third generation fracture fixation material, biodegradable fracture fixation components are currently under research by developed countries. There are many technical challenges to research in the third generation fracture fixation material field; for example, the materials must have a high degree of bio-compatibility and mechanical compatibility. They also must be of high biological activity, self-absorbable, and degeneration controllable.

Product Development
 
After careful deliberation, we selected the polymer screw as our first product to market. In order to replace the widely-used metal components, the new materials must meet multiple bio-consistency and mechanical-consistency requirements. Furthermore, they must also exhibit specific properties with respect to bio-activities, degradability, and controllable degradation speed. Although many macromolecule materials are degradable inside human body, relatively few provide the physical characters required for fracture fixation.
 
Development began with selection of macromolecule materials that exhibited the desired physical characters, leading, ultimately, to our selection of polyamide. In order to achieve the desired mechanical performance and degrading speed, various chemical and physical techniques were employed to modify the bio-degradable polyamide so as to synthesize the required new bio-degradable material. This phase of our research also entailed the selection of monomer class, polymerization conditions, the mensuration of polymer molecular weight, hydrophile capability, crystal capability, the mensuration and controlled degrading speed of the polymer, the mensuration and control of the mechanical performance of the polymer, and numerous other critical considerations.
 
Our next challenge was to identify a suitable bio-active inorganic material, and to optimize the compound and associated production conditions. It was critical that we could predict and control the bio-activities of the implanted fixture material, and to this end we used high grade and mature phosphate type bio-active materials, taking into account the preparation characteristics of the compound material, and the surface character requirements of the finished products. We also improved current technical parameters by modifying the surface character, thereby achieving critical control over the desired grain size and surface activities.
 
The third technological hurdle involved the actual preparation and utilization of the engineered compound in conjunction with a bio-active material. Hydronium bombardment of the surface, with spread and cover techniques, was employed during this critical step in the process. This had the effect of creating a well-knit bio-active membrane on the degradable polymer’s surface, and embedding a bio-active core inside the degradable polymer stick, so as to form the bio-active degradable compound material.
 
The final step entailed strengthening and shaping the processed compound by using directional extrusion and molding. Degradable acantha inoculators, fixation screws, orthopedics stuffing, enlace strings, and anti-conglutination membrane can all be manufactured, as needed, using this same technique.
 
Our company has studied and researched Polyamide, changing its chemical and physical properties to meet the above requirements. As a result of our research we have:
 

1. | Increased mechanical strength to 170Mpa. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Increased biological activities to accelerate bone cell substitution. 
3. | Extended the degeneration period during the implant. While the PA is degenerating layer by layer, the bone cells grow and take its place.

Overview of PA Devices and Market in the US, China and Worldwide
 
According to Transparency Market Research, the global orthopedic device market will reach US$41.2 billion by the end of 2019, owing to multiple factors that are enabling it to progress at a CAGR of 15% from 2019 to 2023.
 
The key drivers of the global orthopedic devices market are the 2 factors below:
 

1. | Rapidly aging population 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | High demand for painless treatments 

 
Growth in geriatric population is primarily pushing demand for orthopedic solutions globally. Effects of aging, such as diminishing bone density and weakening bones due to excessive loss of bone mass, make their presence felt from 35 years of age and become more prominent after 55 years. By 2050, 1 billion or more people would be above 60 years old.
 

In addition, the demand more pain-free treatments and increasing number of sport related injuries and road accidents are expected to fuel the need for orthopedic devices. However, stringent regulatory approval procedures as well as the high cost of surgical procedures and these devices are the main reasons restraining market growth, and making it a high-barrier of entry.

China’s Market for PA Devices
 
With a population of over 1.3 billion, China is the world’s most densely populated country and makes up of one-fifth of the world’s population. China’s population is nearly five times more than United States even though both roughly cover the same geographic area. There are 32 Provinces, Autonomous Regions, and Municipalities of Mainland China.
 
China’s orthopedic implant device industry is in a state of rapid market growth. With the acceleration of population aging, the improvement of medical policies, and an increase in people’s treatment awareness, China’s orthopedic implant medical device sector continues to boom, with a huge potential orthopaedic market base and developmental space. According to Frost & Sullivan, the compound growth rate of the orthopedic industry from 2008 to 2012 was 18.2%. In 2017, the market size reached 3.23 billion USD and by 2020, the market for implantable orthopedic consumables in China will reach 4 billion US dollars.
 
Competitive Analysis
 
To the best of our knowledge, our Company is the only patent holder of PA technologies in China, as well as the only company received CFDA approval in China. At this time there are no similar products in this market. Moreover, due to the nature of the regulatory environment, and the requirements and logistics of mounting a clinical trial, it would take any new competitor a minimum of three years to catch up to our lead in this area alone. Factoring in our established relationships with key customers, distributors, and regulators, as well as our ready-to-run production facilities, and our actual advantage is considerable longer than the 3 year regulatory advantage. This represents an invaluable window in which to firmly entrench our company as the preferred purveyor of self-reinforced, absorbable biodegradable PA components in the Chinese health care environment.
 
To reiterate, our company and product line offer several critical competitive advantages, specifically:
 

● | There are no similar patent registrations in China. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our initial product, the PA Screw approved by the CFDA in 2018, has completed 100% of the required clinical trials, with a 100% success rate. 
● | We are the only company qualified and permitted to conduct clinical trials of other PA products by China’s CFDA. 
● | We have a timing advantage over other companies in China, which would have to go through the preclinical testing before they could even apply for a permit to conduct actual clinical trials. 
● | Under existing regulation structure, it will take at least 3 years for any competitor’s clinical trials to be completed, and total of 7 or more years to reach the point where we are now. 

Specific Competition
 
Competition in the medical implant device industry is intense both in China and in global markets. In orthopedics, ABMT’s principal competitors are the numerous companies that sell metal implants. ABMT competes with the manufacturers and marketers of metal implants by emphasizing the ease of implantation of the Company’s polymer implants, the cost effectiveness of such products, and the elimination of risks associated with the necessity of performing removal surgeries frequently required with less modern products.
 
Our Polymer (PA) Bone Screw is the first of its kind among all polymer-based implantations and has no competitors due to the sophisticated manufacturing technologies and technique needed for its production.
 
According to the record from CFDA and our estimates, it will take at least 5 years for another medical device provider with similar technology to appear in the market. This is because much time will need to be spent on developing material compatibility, safety and undergoing clinical trials in reaching proper standards.
 
In addition, the current market is mainly saturated with metallic compound bone screws, and the medical industry has been using it predominantly since the 1900s. Not only is our invented material biologically stable and easily accepted by the human body, it is also very versatile and therefore has a great market potential.
 
Our primary competition will be the generation-one and generation-two counterparts, which, despite their functional inferiority, enjoy the benefit of familiarity and an established manufacturing and marketing base. This competition comes from a number of entrenched players worldwide, including DePuySynth, Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc., Medtronic Plc, Smith and Nephew Plc, Stryker Corp. and others. Although many of these competitors have substantially greater resources upon which to draw, we are confident that the technological superiority of the more forward-looking product will ultimately equalize the playing field by orthopaedic innovation.

Product Comparisons
 
Among many other advantages, a main advantage of ABMT’s proprietary PA technology is the elimination of the need for secondary surgery to remove an implantation device. Implant removal belongs to the most common elective orthopaedic procedures in industrial countries. In children, implant removal may be necessary to remove implants early to avoid disturbances to the growing skeleton, to prevent their bony immuring making later removal technically difficult or impossible, and to allow for planned reconstructive surgery after skeletal maturation (e.g., in case of hip dysplasia). In adults, pain, soft tissue irritation, the resumption of strenuous activities or contact sports after fracture healing, and the patient’s demand are typical indications for implant removal in clinical practice. However, implant removal requires a second surgical procedure in scarred tissue, and poses a risk for nerve damage and re-fractures. (cite: Hanson et al.BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2008)

1Metallic Compounds have been traced in serum and hair of 16 of 46 patients after receiving titanium implants. (cite: Kasai Y, Iida R, Uchida A: Metal concentrations in the serum and hair of patients with titanium alloy spinal implants.)
 
2Implant removal belongs to the most common elective orthopaedic procedures in the industrial countries. In a frequently cited Finnish study, implant removal contributed to almost 30% of all planned orthopaedic operations, and 15% of all operations. (cite: Bostman O, Pihlajamaki H: Routine implant removal after fracture surgery: a potentially reducible consumer of hospital resources in trauma units.)
 


Towards the end of the last century, spinal and orthopedic implants evolved towards progressively stronger and stiffer devices, as it was presumed that increased construct rigidity would optimize the biological milieu and provide more rapid and robust healing and arthrodesis. For the past 20 years, titanium has been the most widely used, and the most expensive material for fixing fractures (in both elective and emergency surgery). More than 1,000 tons (2.2 million pounds) of titanium devices of every description and function are implanted in patients worldwide each year. Although metal exhibits the desired strength and rigidity to allow the healing process to begin, there are a number of issues associated with using permanent titanium systems. Our PA materials deliver many of the benefits of their metal counterparts, without the disadvantages:
