 We are a financial holding company headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee. Through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Bank (FSB), a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, we provide a full range of banking and related financial services with a focus on service to small businesses, corporate entities, local governments and individuals. We operate through 15 branches and a loan production office in the growing Williamson, Rutherford and Davidson Counties within the Nashville metropolitan area. As used in this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, any reference to “Franklin Financial,” “our Company,” “the Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” refers to Franklin Financial Network, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (including Franklin Synergy Bank), any reference to “FFN” refers to Franklin Financial Network, Inc. only and any reference to “Franklin Synergy” or the “Bank” refers to our banking subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Bank. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated total assets of $4.2 billion, total loans, including loans held for sale, of $2.7 billion, total deposits of $3.4 billion and total equity of $372.8 million. 
 Our principal executive office is located at 722 Columbia Avenue, Franklin, Tennessee 37064-2828, and our telephone number is (615) 236-2265. Our website is www.franklinsynergybank.com. The information contained on or accessible from our website does not constitute a part of this report and is not incorporated by reference herein. 
 Our History and Growth 
 Franklin Financial Network, Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee on April 5, 2007. FSB was incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee and received its Certificate of Authority from the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (TDFI) and approval for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance on November 2, 2007. FSB is also a member of the Federal Reserve System. 
 The Bank provides financial services through its offices in Franklin, Brentwood, Spring Hill, Murfreesboro, Nashville, Nolensville, and Smyrna, Tennessee. Its primary deposit products are checking, savings, and certificate of deposit accounts, and its primary lending products are commercial and residential construction, commercial, installment loans and loans secured by home equity. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including commercial and residential real estate, business assets, and consumer assets. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid by cash flow from operations of businesses. The Company also focuses on electronic banking products such as internet banking, remote deposit capture and lockbox services and treasury management services. 
 On December 28, 2015, FFN invested in a wholly-owned subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Risk Management, Inc., which provides risk management services to the Company in the form of enhanced insurance coverages. 
 On March 1, 2016, the Bank invested in a wholly-owned subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Investments of Tennessee, Inc. (“FSIT”), which provides investment services to the Bank. Also on March 1, 2016, FSIT invested in a wholly-owned subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Investments of Nevada, Inc. (“FSIN”), to provide investment services to FSIT related to certain municipal securities. In addition, on March 1, 2016, FSIN invested in a subsidiary, Franklin Synergy Preferred Capital, Inc., to serve as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), to allow the Bank to sell real estate loans to obtain a tax benefit. FSIN has a controlling interest in the REIT, but the REIT also has a group of investors that own a noncontrolling interest in the preferred stock of the REIT. 
 Acquisitions
 On July 1, 2014, the Bank completed its acquisition of MidSouth Bank (“MidSouth") for 2,766,191 shares of FFN Common Stock valued at approximately $40.1 million. We acquired net assets with a fair value of $41.1 million, which included goodwill of $9.1 million, loans with a fair value of $184.3 million and deposits with a fair value of $244.4 million. The acquisition extended our footprint into Rutherford County and increased our capacity to provide wealth management and trust-related services to our customers.
 On April 1, 2018, the Bank completed its acquisition of Civic Bank and Trust (“Civic”) for 970,390 shares of FFN common stock valued at approximately $31.6 million. We acquired net assets with a fair value of $24.1 million, which included goodwill of $9.1 million, loans with a fair value of $96.4 million and deposits with a fair value of $123.2 million. The acquisition expanded our footprint into Davidson County, where we already had an established base of commercial and retail customers.

Our Market 
 The Bank operates 15 branches in Williamson, Davidson, and Rutherford counties and a loan production office within the Nashville metropolitan area. Our markets are among the most attractive, both in Tennessee, and the Southeast, and compare favorably to some of the more well-known and higher-profile markets in the U.S. We believe that our focus on, and success in, growing market share in Williamson, Davidson, and Rutherford Counties will enhance our long-term value and profitability compared to financial institutions of our size in other regions of the country. The markets in which we operate are characterized by strong demographics including income levels that are well above both regional and national median levels, increasing population, a growing workforce, and unemployment that tends to be below the national rate. 
Our Business Strategy 
 We consider ourselves to be full-service bankers. Our core business strategy is to cultivate strong long-term customer relationships by developing an extraordinary team of officers and employees focused on the customer experience and offering our customers a full suite of financial service products. We deliver a level of personal service to our customers that we believe is superior to that of the out-of-state super-regional and national financial institutions operating in our markets, while simultaneously managing risk and profitability by remaining selective when expanding our customer base and making loans. 
 By continuing to offer several value-added products and services to our customers, such as mortgage lending and wealth management, by investing in technology to improve our systems and the customer experience, and by leveraging strong relationships with consumers, professionals, local governments and businesses within our community, we believe we can gain greater market share, thereby improving our operational efficiency and increase profitability. As evidence of the success of our strategy, our deposit market share in Williamson County has increased from 3.4% in 2009 to a market-leading deposit share of approximately 28.2% per the FDIC’s Summary of Deposits report as of June 30, 2018, despite the presence of more institutions competing for deposits. The Bank’s deposit market share in Rutherford County has grown to 13.4%, which ranks second.
 Well Positioned in Attractive Markets 
 We believe that we are well positioned to grow our business profitably in the demographically attractive and growing markets within the Nashville metropolitan area in which we operate. We believe that our target market segments, small to medium size for- profit businesses and the consumer base working or living in and near our geographical footprint, demand the convenience and personal service that a smaller, independent financial institution such as ours can offer. We believe the heavy out-of-state banking presence (out-of-state super-regional and national financial institutions control approximately 50.6% of local deposits in the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin metropolitan statistical area (the “Nashville MSA”) as of June 30, 2018) provides an opportunity for a strong local bank like ours to increase market share from customers who are looking for more personal banking services and a more customer-friendly experience. Through our efforts to expand our deposit base, we currently have the largest market share of deposits in Williamson County. 
Products and Services 
 The Bank operates as a full-service financial institution with a full line of financial products, including: 
 Commercial Banking 
 The Bank focuses on small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed professionals. 
 The Bank seeks to provide high quality service to its customers supported by the latest bank technology. In the credit service area, the Bank endeavors to give its commercial customers access to a highly trained team of credit and deposit service specialists who remain with the customer relationship for long periods of time. Credit decisions are made locally. 
Consumer Banking 
 The Bank offers a broad range of financial services designed to meet the credit, savings, and transactional needs of local consumers. Mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other personal loans are the focus of consumer lending. Deposits and other transactions are provided via a dual delivery systems of traditional branches and the Internet, including mobile banking. 
Mortgage Loans 
 Our mortgage department originates single-family, residential mortgage loans, the large majority of which are sold in the secondary market. Construction loans also are available for residential and commercial purposes. 
 4

Deposits 
 The Bank’s deposit products include demand, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit (“CDs”), municipal deposits, savings, and deposit accounts. CDs offer various maturities ranging from 30 days to five years. The Bank generates relationships by personal contacts within the conventional trading markets for such services by its officers, directors, and employees, who include persons with banking experience in these markets. The Bank also solicits local deposits through the Internet and offers Internet-only deposit accounts to supplement traditional depository accounts. 
Wealth Management/Trust Services 
 The Bank offers retirement planning, financial planning, investment services, and insurance products through its wealth management department which had approximately $374.0 million in assets under management (AUM) as of December 31, 2018 and approximately $359.0 million AUM as of December 31, 2017.
 
Recent Trends and Developments  
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $2.7 billion in loans, including loans held for sale, assets of $4.2 billion, deposits of $3.4 billion, and equity of $372.8 million. As of June 30, 2018, the Bank was number one in deposit market share in Williamson County, and was number two in deposit market share in Rutherford County.
 Legislative relief and regulatory changes implemented in mid-2018 allow for the reciprocation of local government deposits, eliminating the requirement for the Bank to pledge securities as collateral on such deposits. Therefore, the Bank accelerated the previously planned balance sheet rotation that will ultimately re-deploy $300 million from the securities portfolio into higher-yielding assets. The Bank reduced the bond portfolio by $246 million through sales and principal payments from the mortgage backed securities (MBS) portfolio, recognizing a pre-tax loss of $4.2 million. The majority of the realized loss generated by the securities sales had an immaterial impact on the Company’s capital since previous, unrealized securities losses had been accounted for through accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).
 In January 2019, the Company declared an initial dividend of $0.04 per share, which was paid on February 28, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2019.
 On January 15, 2019, the Bank announced that its Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with banking authorities had been terminated.
 In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of the Company’s common stock, which will remain in effect until January 2020. The timing and amount of additional common share repurchases will be subject to market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other considerations, as the Company deems appropriate. The Company’s repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other transactions. There have been no repurchases of stock under the program.
 On March 8, 2019, Richard E. Herrington retired from his position as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of FFN and as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. J. Myers Jones, III, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of the Bank, has been appointed to serve as interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company while the Board conducts a search for the Company’s next Chief Executive Officer, and Lee Moss, President of the Bank, has been appointed to serve as interim President of FFN. The Board has an active search process underway to select the next chief executive officer from internal and external candidates. On March 8, 2019, we entered into an Executive Transition Agreement with Mr. Herrington, pursuant to which Mr. Herrington has agreed to remain an employee of the Company through September 8, 2019 to provide services to the Company on a transitional basis. On March 8, 2019, the Board elected James W. Cross, IV to serve as the Chairman of the Board to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Herrington’s departure. Also on March 8, 2019, Kevin A. Herrington notified the Company that he is resigning from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Bank, effective as of March 8, 2019. Kevin Herrington has also agreed to remain an employee of the Company through September 8, 2019 to provide services to the Company on a transitional basis. On March 8, 2019, the Board appointed Terry Howell as interim Chief Operating Officer of the Bank and Eddie Maynard as Chief Credit Officer of the Bank.
 Competition 
 The Bank is subject to intense competition from various financial institutions and other companies or firms that offer financial services. The Bank competes for deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as money market and mutual funds. In making loans, the Bank competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies, and other lenders. Information about specific competition in Williamson County, Davidson County, and Rutherford County is included under “RISK 
 5

FACTORS—Competition For Deposits And Loans Is Intense, and No Assurance Can Be Given That We Will Be Successful in Our Efforts to Compete with Other Financial Institutions.” 
 The Bank will continue to compete with these and other financial institutions, many of which have far greater assets and financial resources than the Bank and whose common stock may be more widely traded than that of the Company’s. See “BUSINESS—Supervision and Regulation.” No assurance can be given that the Bank will be successful in its efforts to compete with such other institutions. 
Risk Management
 We place significant emphasis on risk mitigation as an integral component of our Company’s culture. We believe that our emphasis on risk management is manifested in our solid asset quality statistics and our credit risk management procedures discussed above. 
 We also focus on risk management in numerous other areas throughout our organization, including asset/liability management, regulatory compliance and internal controls. We have implemented an extensive asset/liability management process aided by simulation models provided by reputable third parties. We engage in ongoing internal audit and review of all areas of our operations and regulatory compliance. 
 We have implemented management assessment and testing of internal controls consistent with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and have engaged an experienced independent public accounting firm to assist us with respect to compliance. 
 Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company and Bank collectively have 337 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements. We offer a typical health and disability insurance plan to our employees and those of the Bank, as well as a 401(k) plan and officer equity-based incentive awards.  
Trademarks 
 We obtained registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the protection of the trademarks “FRANKLIN SYNERGY BANK®” and “FRANKLIN FINANCIAL NETWORK®.” Management does not believe these trademarks are confusingly similar to trademarks used by other institutions in the financial services business and intends to protect the use of these trademarks nationwide. 
Policies and Procedures 
 The Board of Directors of the Bank annually reviews and approves the Loan Policy, which is the primary tool for making credit decisions when making loans. Asset quality is of utmost importance and an independent loan review process has been established to monitor the Bank’s lending function. It is imperative that the Board of Directors and management have an independent and objective evaluation of the quality of specific individual loans and of the overall quality of the total portfolio. 
 The Board of Directors of the Bank also has established an investment policy that guides Bank officers in determining the investment portfolio of the Bank and its investment subsidiaries. Other policies include a code of ethics, audit policy, fair lending, compliance, bank secrecy, personnel and information system policies. 
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”), the Federal Reserve evaluates the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities in which it operates, including low- and moderate-income communities. The Federal Reserve also takes this record into account when deciding on certain applications submitted by the Bank and the Company. Under the CRA, the Bank’s assessment area is Williamson County, Davidson County, and Rutherford County. 
 Management’s lending objectives are to make credit products available to all segments of the Bank’s market and community. Williamson County has no moderate income census tracts, Davidson County has 44 moderate income census tracts and 28 low income tracts, and Rutherford County has 13 moderate census tracts and two low census tracts. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 The following summaries of statutes and regulations affecting banks and their holding companies do not purport to be complete. Such summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations described.

Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 FFN is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Holding Company Act”), and is registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve. Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are subject to restrictions under federal law, which limit the transfer of funds by the subsidiary banks to their affiliates, their holding companies and non-banking subsidiaries of such holding companies, whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, such transfers by any subsidiary bank to any single affiliate are limited in amount to 10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all affiliates as a group, to an aggregate of 20% of such bank’s capital and surplus. Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts. The Holding Company Act also prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any company engaged in non-banking activities. An exception to this prohibition is for activities expressly found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the Federal Reserve by regulation or order. Certain servicing activities are also permissible for a bank holding company if conducted for or on behalf of the bank holding company or any of its affiliates. FFN has elected to be a financial holding company under Regulation Y, allowing FFN to engage in certain additional financial activities without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
 As a bank holding company, FFN is required to file with the Federal Reserve quarterly financial reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may also make examinations of FFN and its non-bank affiliates. 
 According to federal law and Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such subsidiary. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support. 
 Regulation Y generally requires a person or persons acting in concert to give the Federal Reserve 60 days advanced written notice before acquiring direct or indirect control of a bank holding company. Under the regulation, control is defined as the ownership control, or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. The regulation also provides for a presumption of control if a person or group of persons acting in concert owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote 10% or more (but less than 25%) of any class of voting securities of another bank holding company. A bank holding company may be limited to ownership of 5% of any class of voting securities. If the person or persons making the acquisition is a “company” as defined by the Holding Company Act, prior approval from the Federal Reserve may be required. 
 Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. The payment of dividends by any bank also may be affected by other factors, such as the maintenance of adequate capital for such subsidiary bank. In addition to the foregoing restrictions, the Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve’s view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that could only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. The Federal Reserve may also order a bank holding company to terminate an activity or control of a non-bank subsidiary if such activity or control constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of a subsidiary bank and is inconsistent with sound banking principles. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”) also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a Tennessee bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 
 A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, any banks located outside of the state in which the operations of the bank holding company’s subsidiaries are located, unless the bank holding company and its subsidiaries are well-capitalized and well-managed. 
 In approving acquisitions by holding companies of banks and companies engaged in the banking-related activities described above, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors, including the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, as weighed against the risks of possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to differentiate between new activities and activities commenced through the acquisition of a going concern. 
 The Attorney General of the United States may, within 30 days after approval by the Federal Reserve of an acquisition, bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws, in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending 
 7

a final ruling by the courts. Failure of the Attorney General to challenge an acquisition does not, however, exempt the holding company from complying with both state and federal antitrust laws after the acquisition is consummated or immunize the acquisition from future challenge under the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. 
 Capital Guidelines 
 The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and member banks. Under the guidelines, the minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. To be considered a “well capitalized” bank or bank holding company under the guidelines, a bank or bank holding company must have a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater. At least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common equity, retained earnings, and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock, after subtracting goodwill and certain other adjustments (“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder may consist of perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock not qualifying for Tier 1 capital, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves (“Tier 2 capital”). The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) of 3% or 4% based on supervisory considerations. Generally, banking organizations are expected to operate well above the minimum required capital level of 3% unless they meet certain specified criteria, including that they have the highest regulatory ratings. Most banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 3% or 4%, as applicable, plus an additional cushion of at least 1% to 2%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance upon intangible assets. 
 In July 2013, the federal banking regulators, in response to the statutory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord (“Basel III”), which had been approved by the Basel member central bank governors in 2010 as an agreement among the countries’ central banks and bank regulators on the amount of capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses and insolvency. The new minimum capital to risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) requirements are a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.5% and a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0%, and a Total Capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The new rule also changes the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the new rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 
 Under the Basel III rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016 and the requirements were fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation budget threshold for 2018 was 1.875%. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% will not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% will be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The rule also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework will require us to meet minimum capital ratios of (i) 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 Capital, and (iii) 10.5% Total Capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. Now that the new rule is fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer exceed the prompt corrective action (“PCA”) well-capitalized thresholds. 
 Mortgage-servicing assets and deferred tax assets are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the older risk-based capital rule. More specifically, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, mortgage-servicing assets, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock are each subject to an individual limit of 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital elements and are subject to an aggregate limit of 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital elements. The amount of these items in excess of the 10% and 15% thresholds are to be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Amounts of mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted due to the aforementioned 10% and 15% thresholds must be assigned a 250% risk weight. Finally, the new rule increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. 
 In May of 2018, Congress passed and the President signed into law, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”). Among many important changes to the regulation of the banking industry, the EGRRCPA ordered the federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and FDIC to, through notice and comment rulemaking, develop an “off-
 8

ramp” exempting certain banking organizations with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets and a low-risk profile from generally applicable leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements if such banking organization maintained a leverage ratio to be set by the federal banking regulators (the “Community Bank Leverage Ratio”).  The EGRRCPA requires the federal banking regulators to set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio between 8% and 10%. On November 21, 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to implement Section 201 of the EGRRCPA. The proposed rule would set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. To date, the proposed rule implementing Section 201 of the EGRRCPA has not been finalized.
 Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. 
 Tennessee Banking Act; Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
 The Bank is incorporated under the banking laws of the State of Tennessee and, as such, is subject to the applicable provisions of those laws. The Bank is subject to the supervision of the TDFI and to regular examination by that department. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve and therefore is subject to Federal Reserve regulations and policies and is subject to regular exam by the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund, or “DIF,” and the Bank is, therefore, subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”). 
 The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC was required to adopt regulations that would base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and to include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent an increase in the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also repealed the prohibition on paying interest on demand transaction accounts, but did not extend unlimited insurance protection for these accounts. 
 The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 Tennessee statutes and the federal law regulate a variety of the banking activities of the Bank, including required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, and the establishment of branches. There are certain limitations under federal and Tennessee law on the payment of dividends by banks. A state bank, with the approval of the TDFI, may transfer funds from its surplus account to the undivided profits (retained earnings) account or any part of its paid-in-capital account. The payment of dividends by any bank is dependent upon its earnings and financial condition and, in addition to the limitations referred to above, is subject to the statutory power of certain federal and state regulatory agencies to act to prevent what they deem unsafe or unsound banking practices. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Also, without regulatory approval, a dividend only can be paid to the extent of the net income of the Bank for that year plus the net income of the prior two years. The FDIA prohibits a state bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, from paying dividends if it is in default in the payment of any assessments due the FDIC. 
 State banks also are subject to regulation respecting the maintenance of certain minimum capital levels (see above), and the Bank is required to file annual reports and such additional information as the Tennessee Banking Act and Federal Reserve regulations require. The Bank also is subject to certain restrictions on loan amounts, interest rates, “insider” loans to officers, directors and principal shareholders, tie-in arrangements, privacy, transactions with affiliates, and many other matters. Strict compliance at all times with state and federal banking laws is required. 
 Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted and on the types of investments which may be made. The operations of banks are also affected by various consumer laws and regulations, including those relating to equal credit opportunity and regulation of consumer lending practices. All Tennessee banks must become and remain insured under the FDIA. (See 12 U.S.C. § 1811, et seq.). 
 Under Tennessee law, state banks are prohibited from lending to any one person, firm, or corporation amounts more than 15% of its equity capital accounts, except (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples or (ii) the Bank may make a loan to one person, firm or corporation of up to 25% of its equity capital accounts with the prior written approval of the Bank’s Board of Directors or finance committee (however titled). 
 9

The TDFI and the Federal Reserve will examine the Bank periodically for compliance with various regulatory requirements. Such examinations, however, are for the protection of the DIF and for depositors and not for the protection of investors and shareholders. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) 
 FDICIA substantially revised the depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of the FDIA, and made revisions to several other federal banking statutes. Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Under applicable regulations, a FDIC-insured depository institution is defined to be well capitalized if it maintains a Leverage Ratio of at least 5%, a risk adjusted Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6% and a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10% and is not subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. An insured depository institution is defined to be adequately capitalized if it meets all of its minimum capital requirements as described above in the first paragraph of the section entitled “Capital Guidelines.” In addition, an insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required measure; significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a tier 1 risked-based capital ratio less than 3% or a leverage ratio less than 3%; and critically undercapitalized if it fails to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to not less than 2% of total assets. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 
 FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution’s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution’s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within 90 days of the date on which they became critically undercapitalized. 
 The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA and their implementing regulations apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and are not directly applicable to the holding companies which control those institutions. However, the Federal Reserve has indicated that, in regulating bank holding companies, it will take appropriate action at the holding company level based on an assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary depository institutions pursuant to these provisions and regulations. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations under FDICIA governing the receipt of brokered deposits and pass-through insurance. Under the regulations, a bank cannot accept or rollover or renew brokered deposits unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that cannot receive brokered deposits also cannot offer “pass-through” insurance on certain employee benefit accounts. Whether or not it has obtained this waiver, an adequately capitalized bank may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain index prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. 
 FDICIA contains numerous other provisions, including accounting, audit and reporting requirements, limitations on the FDIC’s payment of deposits at foreign branches, new regulatory standards in such areas as asset quality, earnings and compensation and revised regulatory standards for, among other things, powers of state banks, real estate lending and capital adequacy. FDICIA also requires that a depository institution provide 90 days prior notice of the closing of any branches.

The Dodd-Frank Act 
 In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, incorporating numerous financial institution regulatory reforms. Many of these reforms and continue to be implemented through regulations being adopted by various federal banking and securities regulators. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions only apply to larger financial institutions and do not directly impact community-based institutions like the Bank. For instance, provisions that enhance supervision of “systemically significant” institutions, impose new regulatory authority over hedge funds, and phase-out the eligibility of trust preferred securities for Tier 1 capital are among the provisions that do not directly impact the Bank either because of exemptions for institutions below a certain asset size or because of the nature of the Bank’s operations. Other provisions that have impacted or will impact the Bank: 

• | Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling and increase the size of the floor of the DIF, and offset the impact of the increase in the minimum floor on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Make permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Repeal the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depositing institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), responsible for implementing federal consumer protection laws, although banks below $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined and supervised for compliance with these laws by their federal bank regulator.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow national bank subsidiaries from availing themselves of such preemption.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Impose new requirements for mortgage lending, including new minimum underwriting standards, prohibitions on certain yield-spread compensation to mortgage originators, special consumer protections for mortgage loans that do not meet certain provision qualifications, prohibitions and limitations on certain mortgage terms and various new mandated disclosures to mortgage borrowers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to holding companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Permit national and state banks to establish de novo interstate branches at any location where a bank based in that state could establish a branch, and require that bank holding companies and banks be well-capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Impose new limits on affiliated transactions and cause derivative transactions to be subject to lending limits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access to shareholders that apply to all public companies not just financial institutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDIC Insurance Premiums 
 The Bank is required to pay quarterly FDIC deposit insurance assessments to the DIF. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based upon statutory factors that include the balance of insured deposits as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund. The FDIC uses a risk-based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the DIF. 
 On March 15, 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule in accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires large institutions to bear the burden of raising the Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Since the Reserve Ratio has reached 1.15%, the FDIC will collect assessment surcharges from large institutions. Once the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, small institutions will receive credits to offset their contribution to raising the Reserve Ratio to 1.35%. On April 26, 2016, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the final rule to improve the deposit insurance assessment system for established small insured depository institutions (generally, those banks with less than $10 billion in total assets that have been insured for at least five years). The final rule was effective July 1, 2016. Since the reserve ratio of the DIF reached 1.15 percent before that date, the final rule determined assessment rates beginning July 1, 2016. Effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions were reduced from a range of 5 to 35 basis points to a range of 3 to 30 basis points. Total base assessment rates after possible adjustments were reduced from a range of 2.5 to 45 basis points to a range of 1.5 to 40 basis points. Although the base assessment rates were reduced, the assessment calculation includes pricing adjustments for certain financial ratios that relate to asset growth, loan mix, funding ratios, and nonperforming assets, which in the case of the Bank, may adversely impact the Company’s earnings due to increased premium assessments. Additional increases in premiums will impact FFN’s earnings adversely. Depending on any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer due to failed institutions, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional significant premium increases in order to replenish the fund.

Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act  
 The CRA requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within its jurisdiction, the FDIC and the state banking regulators, as applicable, evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. This record is considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on us. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA-related agreements. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges that our subsidiary bank collects or contracts for are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Our bank’s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as: 

• | The Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The rules and regulations of the various governmental agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our bank subsidiary’s deposit operations are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement this act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 
 Effects of Governmental Policies 
 The Bank’s earnings are affected by the difference between the interest earned by the Bank on its loans and investments and the interest paid by the Bank on its deposits or other borrowings. The yields on its assets and the rates paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest. Thus, the earnings and growth of the Bank are influenced by general economic conditions, fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which establishes national monetary policy. The nature and impact of any future changes in fiscal or monetary policies cannot be predicted. 
 Commercial banks are affected by the credit policy of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits. The Federal Reserve uses these means in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also to affect interest rates charged on loans, received on investments or paid for deposits. 
 The monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, also affect the banking industry. Through changes in the reserve requirements against bank deposits, open market operations in U.S. Government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, the Federal Reserve influences the cost and availability of funds obtained for lending and investing. No prediction can be made with respect to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand or with respect to the impact of such changes on the business and earnings of the Bank. 
 From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. The nature and extent of the 
 12

future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions and the resulting impact on those institutions is very unpredictable at this time. Bills are currently pending which may have the effect of changing the way the Bank conducts its business.
