Marketing Partnerships
We maintain marketing partnerships with a number of companies, including Blu Dot, Bolia, Carl Hansen & Son, EMU, Extremis, FLOS, Mattiazzi, Microsoft, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Moooi, Nanimarquina, PolyVision, Tom Dixon and West Elm, which are intended to allow us to offer additional products and services to our dealers and customers that are complementary to our products and services and leverage our scale. These partnerships take several forms, the most common of which involves us purchasing and reselling the partner’s products to our dealers and customers.  In other situations, we market the partner’s products to our dealers and customers and receive a fee from the partner, and we typically transport and deliver those products to our dealers and customers for a fee.  We also have marketing partnerships where we co-develop products with our partner that we manufacture or source from third parties or where we and our partner agree to co-market our products and services to customers. Most of our marketing partnerships are on a regional basis.  
Reportable Segments
We operate on a global basis within our Americas and EMEA reportable segments plus an Other category. Additional information about our reportable segments, including financial information about geographic areas and specific product categories, is contained in Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 4 and Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Americas Segment
Our Americas segment serves customers in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. Our comprehensive portfolio of furniture and architectural products is marketed to corporate, government, healthcare, education and retail customers through the Steelcase, Coalesse, AMQ, Smith System, Orangebox and Viccarbe brands.
We serve Americas customers mainly through approximately 390 Steelcase independent and company-owned dealer locations and other non-aligned dealers, and we also sell directly to end-use customers. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies and are distributed across a broad range of industries and vertical markets, including education, financial services, government, healthcare, information technology, insurance, retail and manufacturing. 
Each of our dealers maintains its own sales force which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with our dealers throughout the selling process. The largest independent Steelcase dealer in the Americas accounted for approximately 6% of the segment’s revenue in 2022, and the five largest independent Steelcase dealers collectively accounted for approximately 18% of the segment’s revenue in 2022.
The Americas office furniture industry is highly competitive, with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products. The industry competes on a combination of insight, product performance, design, price, global service and relationships with customers, architects and designers. Our most significant competitors in the U.S. are MillerKnoll, Inc., Haworth, Inc. and HNI Corporation.
EMEA Segment
Our EMEA segment serves customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily under the Steelcase, Coalesse, Orangebox and Viccarbe brands, with a comprehensive portfolio of furniture and architectural products. Our largest presence is in Western Europe, where we believe we are among the market leaders in France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom ("U.K.").
We serve EMEA customers mainly through approximately 340 independent and company-owned Steelcase dealer locations and other non-aligned dealers, and we also sell directly to end-use customers. The largest independent Steelcase dealer in the EMEA segment accounted for less than 4% of the segment’s revenue in 2022. The five largest Steelcase independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately 12% of the segment’s revenue in 2022. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies spread across a broad range of industries and vertical markets, including education, financial services, flexible real estate, government, healthcare and information technology.

The EMEA office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with many local and regional manufacturers in many different markets. In several cases, these competitors focus on specific product categories.
Other Category
The Other category includes Asia Pacific and Designtex.
Asia Pacific serves customers in Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia primarily under the Steelcase brand with a comprehensive portfolio of furniture and architectural products. We primarily sell directly to end-use customers as well as through approximately 60 Steelcase independent dealer locations. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies spread across a broad range of industries and are located in both mature and emerging markets. Our competition in Asia Pacific is fragmented and includes large global competitors as well as many regional and local manufacturers.
Designtex sells textiles, wall coverings and surface imaging solutions specified by architects and designers directly to end-use customers through a direct sales force primarily in North America.
Corporate
Corporate costs include unallocated portions of shared service functions such as information technology, corporate facilities, finance, human resources, research, legal and customer aviation, plus deferred compensation expense and income or losses associated with company-owned life insurance ("COLI"). Corporate assets consist primarily of unallocated cash and cash equivalents, COLI, fixed assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and right-of-use assets related to operating leases.
Joint Ventures and Other Equity Investments
We occasionally enter into joint ventures and other equity investments to expand or maintain our geographic presence, support our distribution network or invest in new business ventures, complementary products or services. As of February 25, 2022, our investments in these unconsolidated joint ventures and other equity investments totaled $53.1. Our share of the earnings from joint ventures and other equity investments is recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Customer and Dealer Concentrations
Our largest customer accounted for approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue in 2022, and our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. However, these percentages do not include revenue from various U.S. federal government agencies. In 2022, our sales to U.S. federal government agencies represented approximately 2% of our consolidated revenue. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end-use customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
No single independent Steelcase dealer accounted for more than 4% of our consolidated revenue in 2022. The five largest independent Steelcase dealers collectively accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated revenue in 2022. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single independent dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect on our business.
Manufacturing and Logistics
We have manufacturing operations throughout North America (in the U.S. and Mexico), Europe (in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Spain and the U.K.) and in Asia (in China, India and Malaysia). Our global manufacturing operations are largely centralized under a single organization to serve our customers’ needs across multiple brands and geographies.
Our manufacturing model is predominately make-to-order with lead times which have typically ranged from four to six weeks. We manufacture our products using lean manufacturing principles, including continuous one-piece flow and platformed processes and products, which allow us to achieve efficiencies and cost savings and minimize the amount of inventory on hand. We largely purchase direct materials and components from a global 
Table of Contents

network of integrated suppliers as needed to meet demand. We also purchase finished goods manufactured by third parties predominately on a make-to-order basis. 
 During 2022, our manufacturing operations were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions, including lack of availability of certain raw materials and components, labor shortages and shipping delays across long distance supply chains. These challenges had a significant impact on our ability to manufacture and supply products to our customers within historical time frames and increased our logistics and labor costs. We also increased our levels of inventory on hand to mitigate challenges associated with purchasing raw materials and components in a timely manner as a result of these disruptions.
We focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations, and we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort. We focus on platforming our product offering and capturing raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe. These efforts enhance our leverage with supply sources. We also focus on our reliability which may, at times, require localizing supply chains and enhancing capabilities to deliver complete orders and on-time to our customers.
Our physical distribution system utilizes commercial transport, dedicated fleet and company-owned delivery services. We utilize a network of regional distribution centers in the Americas and EMEA to minimize freight and delivery costs and improve service to our dealers and customers.
Materials
Approximately 61% of our cost of sales in 2022 related to raw materials, components and finished goods purchased from a significant number of suppliers around the world. The raw materials that we purchase and that are used in the manufacture of the components and finished goods that we purchase include steel, petroleum-based products (including plastics and foam), aluminum, other metals, wood and particleboard. Our global supply chain team continually evaluates current market conditions, the financial viability of our suppliers and available supply options on the basis of quality, reliability of supply and cost.
During 2022, the availability of materials was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions as discussed above. The prices for many of the raw materials, components and finished goods we purchase were affected by significant inflationary pressures during 2022.
Research, Design and Development
Our extensive global research—a combination of user observations, feedback sessions and sophisticated analyses—has helped us develop social, spatial and informational insights into work effectiveness. We maintain collaborative relationships with external world-class innovators, including leading universities, think tanks and knowledge leaders, to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work.
Understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe. Our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs, which vary from furniture and architectural solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products and across different vertical market applications such as healthcare and education. Organizationally, global design leadership directs strategy and project work, which is distributed to design studios around the world and sometimes involves external design services.
Our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria, including financial return metrics, and chooses which products will be developed and launched. Designers then work closely with engineers and suppliers to co-develop products and processes that incorporate innovative user features with efficient manufacturing practices. Products are tested for performance, quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations.
We incurred $45.4, $48.1 and $50.6 in research, design and development expenses in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we sometimes pay royalties to external designers of our products as the products are sold, and these costs are not included in research and development expenses.
Intellectual Property
We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. We also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace. We do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the 
Table of Contents

continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such, except the “Steelcase,” "Designtex," “Coalesse,” "AMQ," “Smith System,” and “Orangebox” trademarks.
We occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products, designs or process technology. We have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries.
Human Capital Resources
We aspire to be a people-centered, purpose-driven company where our employees feel like they belong and are proud of their work. At Steelcase, we believe that together we will help to support and build a healthy planet, healthy people and a healthy culture based on integrity and trust. This work is supported by our core values, which are:
•act with integrity,

•keep commitments, 
•treat people with dignity and respect,

We invest in our employees through multiple avenues, including providing competitive pay and benefits, sharing profits through our annual bonus programs, offering career development and professional training programs, providing inspiring and supportive spaces for our employees to work and collaborate and offering a range of services to support our employees' physical, emotional, cognitive and financial well-being.
Our leaders play a critical role in curating our culture, and we have established a set of leadership pillars and accompanying learning and development activities designed to promote empathic leadership and align leader actions with our core values and the culture we strive to create. These pillars are:
•build strong teams, 
•unite in purpose, 
•create clarity, 
•cultivate resilience, and 
•deliver results. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We strive to create an environment where employees around the globe are valued, respected, accepted and encouraged to be authentic and to fully participate in our organization. We believe our culture helps to unlock each employee's unique contributions and amplifies the power of the individual to better serve our customers and the communities in which we live and work. We are focused on enhancing a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion through the following key objectives: 
•build diverse teams that reflect our communities,
•ensure equitable access to development opportunities across the organization, and
•create a culture of inclusion that promotes curiosity and creativity. 
Learning and Development
Learning is how we work and how we lead. We aspire to be a learning organization that builds capabilities for the evolving needs of our business and adapts our culture as a competitive advantage. Developing our talent in 
Table of Contents

consistent ways is essential to our business strategy, and we are continually focused on providing all our employees with the resources they need to reach their full potential. We approach talent development through a variety of tools, practices and experiences, including: 
•connecting our employees to digital learning experiences to help them thrive, 
•identifying sought-out skills from our employees and designing learning paths related to these skills, 
•emphasizing an environment that values learning as an everyday practice across the organization, and
•holding frequent and purposeful conversations between employees and leaders that inspire achievement and growth.
Employee Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate talented employees. Our philosophy is to:
•value the contribution of our employees, 
•motivate achievement of strategic objectives that will contribute to our company’s success, and
•share profits through broad-based incentive arrangements designed to reward performance for all employees. 
This philosophy is achieved through competitive pay and benefits and a variety of other offerings such as career development and well-being initiatives. We review pay ranges annually and adjust pay as needed to ensure external competitiveness and internal equity. We also share profits with both salaried and hourly employees through our annual bonus programs. We believe our philosophy helps promote a culture where our employees feel like they are supported and that their contributions are valued. 
Employees
As of February 25, 2022, we had approximately 11,800 employees, of which approximately 6,900 work in manufacturing and distribution and approximately 200 are part-time. Additionally, we had approximately 1,100 temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing. Approximately 40 employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 2,800 employees are represented by unions or workers' councils that operate to promote the interests of workers. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (“Environmental Laws”). We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all Environmental Laws. We do not believe existing Environmental Laws have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Under certain Environmental Laws, we could be held liable, without regard to fault, for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations. We could also be held responsible for third-party property and personal injury claims or for violations of Environmental Laws relating to contamination. We are a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under Environmental Laws, including as a potentially responsible party in several Superfund site cleanups. Based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties, the total estimated cleanup costs and other financially viable potentially responsible parties, we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material, either individually or in the aggregate. We have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs. However, certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves. These events include, but are not limited to: a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements; undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties; the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs; and other factors increasing the cost of remediation.
