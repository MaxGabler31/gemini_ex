ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Fiscal 2022 Significant Developments
On November 1, 2021, Dell Technologies completed its previously announced spin-off of VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) by means of a special stock dividend (the “VMware Spin-off”). The VMware Spin-off was effectuated pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2021, between Dell Technologies and VMware (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”). As part of the transaction, VMware paid a special cash dividend, pro rata, to each holder of VMware common stock in an aggregate amount equal to $11.5 billion, of which Dell Technologies received $9.3 billion. 
In connection with and upon completion of the VMware Spin-off, Dell Technologies and VMware entered into a Commercial Framework Agreement (the “CFA”). The CFA provides a framework under which Dell Technologies and VMware will continue their commercial relationship after the transaction. 
On October 1, 2021, Dell Technologies completed the sale of Boomi, Inc. (“Boomi”) and certain related assets and received total cash consideration of approximately $4.0 billion. The transaction was intended to support the Company’s focus on fueling growth initiatives through targeted investments to modernize Dell Technologies’ core infrastructure and through expansion in high-priority areas, including hybrid and private cloud, edge, telecommunications solutions, and the Company’s APEX offerings.
With the proceeds from the VMware Spin-off and cash on hand, we were able to make steady progress in paying down our outstanding debt throughout Fiscal 2022. As a result of our debt reduction and continued focus on deleveraging, we achieved an investment grade rating from three major credit rating agencies. 
During Fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to present global challenges that directly impacted Dell Technologies, most notably in relation to supply chain impacts. As a result of the global economic recovery coupled with industry-wide constraints on the supply of limited-source components, we experienced demand which outpaced supply across many of our product offerings. The supply chain impacts led to an increase in orders pending fulfillment and extended lead times for our customers. We continue to closely monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and keep the health of our employees, customers, business partners, and communities as our primary focus.
See Note 1, Note 3, and Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the VMware Spin-off, the Boomi divestiture, and our outstanding debt.
Company Overview
Dell Technologies helps organizations build their digital futures and individuals transform how they work, live and play. We provide customers with one of the industry’s broadest and most innovative solutions portfolio for the data era, including traditional infrastructure and extending to multi-cloud environments. We continue to seamlessly deliver differentiated and holistic information technology (“IT”) solutions to our customers which has helped drive consistent revenue growth.
Dell Technologies’ integrated solutions help customers modernize their IT infrastructure, manage and operate in a multi-cloud world, address workforce transformation, and provide critical solutions that keep people and organizations connected, which has proven even more important through the COVID-19 pandemic. We are helping customers accelerate their digital transformations to improve and strengthen business and workforce productivity. With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from the edge to the core to the cloud, and we are at 
the forefront of the software-defined and cloud native infrastructure era. As further evidence of our commitment to innovation, we are evolving and expanding our IT as-a-Service and cloud offerings including APEX-branded solutions which provide our customers with greater flexibility to scale IT to meet their evolving business needs and budgets. 
Dell Technologies’ end-to-end portfolio is supported by a world-class organization that operates globally in approximately 180 countries across key functional areas, including technology and product development, marketing, sales, financial services, and services. Our go-to-market engine includes a 32,000-person sales force and a global network of over 200,000 channel partners. Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (“DFS”) offer customers payment flexibility and enables synergies across the business. DFS funded $8.5 billion of originations in Fiscal 2022 and maintains a $11 billion global portfolio of high-quality financing receivables. We employ approximately 35,000 full-time service and support professionals and maintain more than 2,400 vendor-managed service centers. We manage a world-class supply chain that drives long-term growth and operating efficiencies, with approximately $75 billion in annual procurement expenditures and over 750 parts distribution centers. Together, these elements provide a critical foundation for our success.
Our Vision and Strategy
Our vision is to become the most essential technology company for the data era. We seek to address our customers’ evolving needs and their broader digital transformation objectives as they embrace today’s hybrid multi-cloud environment. We intend to execute on our vision by focusing on two overarching strategic priorities: 
•Grow and modernize our core offerings in the markets in which we predominantly compete
•Pursue attractive new growth opportunities such as Edge, Telecom, data management, and as-a-Service consumption models
We believe that we are uniquely positioned in the data and multi-cloud era and that our results will benefit from our competitive advantages. We intend to continue to execute our business model to position our company for long-term success while balancing liquidity, profitability, and growth. 
We are seeing an accelerated rate of change in the IT industry and increased demand for simpler, more agile IT as companies leverage multiple clouds in their IT environments. COVID-19 has accelerated the introduction and adoption of new technologies to ensure productivity and collaboration from anywhere. To meet our customer needs, we continue to invest in research and development, sales, and other key areas of our business to deliver superior products and solutions capabilities and to drive long-term sustainable growth.
Products and Services
We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of comprehensive and integrated solutions, products, and services. We are organized into two business units, referred to as Infrastructure Solutions Group and Client Solutions Group, which are our reportable segments.
•Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”) — ISG enables our customers’ digital transformation through our trusted multi-cloud and big data solutions, which are built upon modern data center infrastructure. ISG helps customers in the area of hybrid cloud deployment with the goal of simplifying, streamlining, and automating cloud operations. ISG solutions are built for multi-cloud environments and are optimized to run cloud native workloads in both public and private clouds, as well as traditional on-premise workloads.
Our comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (such as all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, and software-defined solutions). In May 2020, we released our new PowerStore offering, a differentiated midrange storage solution that enables seamless updates using microservices and container-based software architecture. This offering allows us to compete more effectively within midrange storage. We continue to make enhancements to our storage solutions offerings and expect that these offerings will drive long-term improvements in the business.
Our server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers, optimized to run high value workloads, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. 
Our strengths in server, storage, and virtualization software solutions enable us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, allowing our customers to accelerate their IT transformation by acquiring scalable integrated IT solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. ISG also offers attached software, peripherals and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.
Approximately half of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan region (“APJ”).
•Client Solutions Group (“CSG”) — CSG includes branded hardware (such as desktops, workstations, and notebooks) and branded peripherals (such as displays and projectors), as well as third-party software and peripherals. Our computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers’ needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security. For our customers that are seeking to simplify client lifecycle management, Dell PC as-a-Service offering combines hardware, software, lifecycle services, and financing into one all-encompassing solution that provides predictable pricing per seat per month. CSG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.
Approximately half of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.
Our other businesses, described below, consists of our resale of standalone VMware offerings, referred to as VMware Resale, as well as product and service offerings of SecureWorks Corp. (“Secureworks”) and Virtustream. These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively. 
•VMware Resale consists of our sale of standalone VMware offerings. Under the CFA entered into as part of the VMware Spin-off, Dell Technologies continues to act as a key channel partner in this relationship, reselling VMware offerings to our customers. This partnership is intended to facilitate mutually beneficial growth for both Dell and VMware.
VMware works with customers in the areas of hybrid and multi-cloud, modern applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces, helping customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. 
•Secureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks. The solutions offered by Secureworks enable organizations of varying size and complexity to fortify their cyber defenses to prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in near real time, prioritize and respond rapidly to security incidents and predict emerging threats.
•Virtustream offers cloud software and Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions that enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments. 
We believe the collaboration, innovation, and coordination of the operations and strategies across the segments of our business, as well as our differentiated go-to-market model, will continue to drive revenue synergies. Through our research and development activities, we are able to engineer leading innovative solutions that incorporate the distinct set of hardware, software, and services across all segments of our business.
Our products and services offerings are continually evolving in response to industry dynamics. As a result, reclassifications of certain products and services solutions in major product categories may be required. For further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see “Results of Operations — Business Unit Results” and Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
See “Part II — Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Business Unit Results” and Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our reportable segment operating results.
Recurring Revenue and Consumption Models
Our customers are seeking new and innovative models that address how they consume our solutions. We offer options including as-a-Service, utility, leases, and immediate pay models, all designed to match customers’ consumption and financing preferences. We continue to evolve and build momentum across our family of as-a-Service offerings as we pursue our strategy of modernizing our core business solutions, with APEX at the forefront. We expect that our flexible consumption models and as-a-Service offerings will further strengthen our customer relationships and provide a foundation for growth in recurring revenue. 
These offerings typically result in multiyear agreements which generate recurring revenue streams over the term of the arrangements. We define recurring revenue as revenue recognized primarily related to hardware and software maintenance as well as subscription, as-a-Service, and usage based offerings, and operating leases. 
Dell Financial Services
DFS supports our businesses by offering and arranging various financing options and services for our customers globally. DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase or use of our product, software, and services solutions. We also arrange financing for some of our customers in various countries where DFS does not currently operate as a captive entity. DFS further strengthens our customer relationships through its flexible consumption models which provide our customers with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements. Our flexible consumption models enable us to offer our customers the option to pay over time and, in certain cases, based on utilization. The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Research and Development
We focus on developing scalable technology solutions that incorporate desirable features and capabilities at competitive prices. We employ a collaborative approach to product design and development in which our engineers, with direct customer input, design innovative solutions and work with a global network of technology companies to architect new system designs, influence the direction of future development, and integrate new technologies into our products. Our team of software engineers is focused on developing the next generation of solutions for new and innovative technologies. Most of our research and development (“R&D”) expenditures represent costs to develop the software that powers our solutions. This software simplifies the complex through automation, increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology. We manage our R&D spending by targeting those innovations and solutions that we believe are most valuable to our customers and by relying on the capabilities of our strategic relationships. Our customer base includes a growing number of service providers, such as cloud service providers, Software-as-a-Service companies, consumer webtech providers, and telecommunications companies. These service providers turn to Dell Technologies for our advanced solutions that enable efficient service delivery at cloud scale. Through our collaborative, customer-focused approach to innovation, we strive to deliver new and relevant products to the market quickly and efficiently. 
Additionally, we invest in early-stage, privately-held companies that develop software, hardware, and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies. We manage our investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital.
Dell Technologies has a global R&D presence, with total R&D expenses of $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.5 billion, for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, respectively. These investments reflect our commitment to R&D activities that ultimately support our mission to help our customers build their digital future and to transform IT.
Manufacturing and Materials
We own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See “Item 2 — Properties” for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand as part of our strategy to enhance our variable cost structure and to achieve our goals of generating cost efficiencies, delivering products faster, better serving our customers, and enhancing our supply chain.
Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers.
Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, software, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and processing of information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes our global sites and organizations that design, manufacture, and service our products. 
Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities are certified to the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems, the ISO 45001 International Standard for health and safety management systems, and the ISO 50001 International Standard for energy management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality, environmental, health and safety, and energy management are among the highest levels of certifications available. We also have implemented programs and methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships are continually improved. 
We maintain a Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner.
We purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on a single source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry — Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost” for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies’ use of single- or limited-source suppliers.
Geographic Operations
Our global corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. We have operations and conduct business in many countries located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions. To increase our global presence, we continue to focus on emerging markets outside of the United States, Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. We continue to view these geographical markets, which include the vast majority of the world’s population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets. Our expansion in emerging markets creates additional complexity in coordinating the design, development, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and support of our product and services offerings. For information about the amount of net revenue we generated from our operations outside of the United States during the last three fiscal years, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Seasonality
Our sales are affected by seasonal trends. Among the trends with the most significant effect on our operating results, sales to government customers (particularly the U.S. government) generally are stronger in our third fiscal quarter, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are often weaker in our third fiscal quarter, and sales to consumers are typically strongest during our fourth fiscal quarter.
Competition 
We operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. We face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer customers competitive, scalable, and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features at a competitive price. We closely monitor market pricing and solutions trends, including the effect of foreign exchange rate movements, in an effort to provide the best value for our customers. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers and channel partners allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs and other macroeconomic factors.
We also face competition from non-traditional IT companies such as cloud service providers, also known as hyperscalers, that buy their infrastructure directly from original design manufacturers. Competitive pressures could increase if customers choose to move application workloads to cloud service providers away from traditional or private data centers.
The markets in which we compete are comprised of large and small companies across all areas of our business. We believe that new businesses will continue to enter these markets and develop technologies that, if commercialized, may compete with our products and services. Moreover, current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, which may further increase the competitive pressures. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry” for information about our competitive risks. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. Our unified global sales and marketing team creates a sales organization that is customer-focused, collaborative, and innovative. Our customers include large global and national enterprises, public institutions that include governmental agencies, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, and law enforcement agencies, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. 
Go-to-market strategy — We sell products and services directly to customers and through other sales channels, which include value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We continue to pursue our direct business strategy, which emphasizes direct communication with customers, thereby allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs for specific customer groups. In addition to our direct business model, we use our network of channel partners to sell our products and services, enabling us to efficiently serve a greater number of customers. The Dell Technologies partner program contributes to the development of channel sales by providing appropriate incentives to encourage sales generation. We also facilitate access to third-party financing to help our channel partners manage their working capital. We believe that building long-term relationships with our channel partners enhances our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience. During Fiscal 2022, our other sales channels contributed over 50% of our net revenue. 
Large enterprises and public institutions  — For large enterprises and public institutions, we maintain a field sales force throughout the world. Dedicated account teams, which include technical sales specialists, form long-term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance, develop tailored solutions for these customers, position the capabilities of Dell Technologies, and provide us with customer feedback. For these customers, we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and accountability with dedicated account managers, special pricing, and consistent service and support programs. We also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeting federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as healthcare and educational customers.
Small and medium-sized business and consumers — We market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers through various advertising media. To react quickly to our customers’ needs, we track our Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty metric that is widely used across various industries. Net Promoter Score is a trademark of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. We also engage with customers through our social media communities on our website and in external social media channels.
Product Backlog
Product backlog represents the value of unfulfilled manufacturing orders and is included as a component of remaining performance obligations to the extent we determine that the manufacturing orders are non-cancelable. Our business model generally gives us the ability to optimize product backlog at any point in time, such as by expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders for products that have shorter lead times. During Fiscal 2022, we were impacted by industry-wide constraints in the supply of limited-source components in certain product offerings as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. Further, global economic recovery led to growth in demand that outpaced supply and, as a result, we experienced elevated backlog and extended lead times for our customers in certain offerings. 
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
As of January 28, 2022, we held a worldwide portfolio of 18,570 granted patents and 7,619 pending patent applications. As a result of the VMware Spin-off, patents and patent applications held by VMware are no longer being reported as part of our portfolio. We continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities. The inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future computer system and software products, manufacturing processes, and related technologies. We also hold licenses to use numerous third-party patents. Although we use our patented inventions and license some of them to others, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our product and process patents may establish barriers to entry, and we anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will continue to be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry.
We have used, registered, or applied to register certain trademarks and copyrights in the United States and in other countries. We believe that Dell Technologies, DELL, Dell EMC, Alienware, Secureworks, and Virtustream word marks and logo marks in the United States are material to our operations.
We have entered into software licensing agreements with other companies. We also license certain technology and intellectual property from third parties for use in our offerings and processes, and license some of our technologies and intellectual property to third parties. 
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies and other governmental agencies. Such regulation includes the activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the European Union; the consumer protection laws and financial services regulation of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state governmental agencies; the export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Treasury; the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation; the health information privacy and security requirements of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the environmental, employment and labor, and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business. 
Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, performance and safety regulations in all areas in which we conduct business. Product design and procurement operations must comply with requirements relating to materials composition, sourcing, radiated emissions, energy efficiency and collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of electronics products, including restrictions on mercury, lead, cadmium, lithium metal, lithium ion, and other substances. Operations may also become subject to new or emergent standards relating to climate change laws and regulations. The costs and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict. We were not assessed any material environmental fines, nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs, during Fiscal 2022.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and are also subject to export controls, customs, economic sanctions laws, including those currently imposed on Russia, and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.
We are subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Dell Technologies is committed to driving human progress by putting our technology and expertise to work where it can do the most good for both people and the planet.  We recognize that all of our stakeholders — shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, and communities — as well as the environment and society, are essential to our business. 
In November 2019, Dell Technologies announced its social impact goals and plan for 2030 called Progress Made Real (the “2030 Plan”). Our goals under the 2030 Plan represent an extension of our purpose as a company — to create technologies that drive human progress. We are using these goals to build our social impact strategies over the next decade. The 2030 Plan has four critical areas of focus:
•Advancing Sustainability — We believe we have a responsibility to protect and enrich our planet together with our customers, suppliers, and communities. In working across our business ecosystem, Dell Technologies will continue valuing natural resources and seeking to minimizing our impact. With the power of our global supply chain, Dell Technologies has the scale and responsibility to pursue the highest standards of sustainability and ethical practices.
•Cultivating Inclusion — We view diversity and inclusion as a business imperative that will enable us to build and empower our future workforce. It is essential that our workforce be fully representative of the diversity in our global customer base. Diversity of leadership increases innovation and ensures that company decisions reflect a wide variety of perspectives.
•Transforming Lives — We believe our scale, support, and the innovative application of our portfolio can play an important role in advancing fundamental human rights and addressing complex societal challenges, including improving health, education, and economic opportunities for the underserved. We endeavor to harness the power of technology to create a future that is capable of realizing human potential. 
•Upholding Ethics and Privacy — Ethics and privacy play a critical role in establishing a strong foundation for positive social impact. We are committed to ensuring that new talent and existing team members align to our ethical culture. We will continue to invest in our advanced privacy governance and risk-management technology and continue seeking to select, evaluate, and do business with third parties who share our level of dedication to ethics and privacy.
Dell Technologies measures its progress against each goal under the 2030 Plan in its annually released reports available on our website.
Climate Change
At Dell Technologies, we believe that by addressing climate change, we are demonstrating our commitment to protect our planet and the community. We have a responsibility to manage the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our direct and indirect footprint, and technology plays an important role in this undertaking. We aim to reach net zero emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050. 
Human Capital Management
We are a diverse team with unique perspectives, united in our purpose, our strategy, and our culture. Our goal is to ensure that employees of different backgrounds feel valued, engaged, and inspired to do their best work. Through our ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts, flexible workplace transformation programs, training and development offerings, and health and wellness resources for our employees, we are striving to attract, develop and retain an empowered workforce for maximum impact internally and externally for our customers and communities. We believe in winning with integrity, and we leverage technology and deploy state-of-the-art tools to assist our team members in applying the principles of integrity and compliance as part of everyday business transactions, activities, and decisions. We seek to support our culture in four key focus areas: diversity and inclusion, achievement, balance, and connection. 
Diversity and Inclusion — At Dell Technologies, we believe diversity is power. Within our 2030 Plan, one critical area of focus — cultivating inclusion — highlights how our human capital resources are vital to our social impact and long-term success. Cultivating inclusion is a core component of our culture, and we believe that closing the diversity gap is critical to meeting future talent needs and ensuring that new perspectives reflect our global customer base. We are committed to equal employment opportunity for all and upholding ethics and integrity in all we do and will continue to champion for inclusive policies that support full-spectrum diversity. 
As of January 28, 2022, we had approximately 133,000 employees, approximately 32% of whom were located in the United States. Excluding employees of Secureworks, the overall representation of employees who self-identify as women was approximately 34%. Of our global people leaders, 28% self-identified as women. We define people leaders as employees in a job management level or executive or manager position. 
As of the same date, our U.S. employee base was comprised of employees who self-identified with the following ethnicities: 65% as White or Caucasian; 15% as Asian; 9% as Hispanic or Latino; 6% as Black or African American; 2% with two or more races; and 1% with additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). Approximately 2% of our U.S. employee base did not self-report or specify ethnicity status. Of our U.S. people leaders, 12% self-identified as Hispanic or Latino or as Black or African American. 
As the composition of the workforce evolves, we recognize that companies embracing diversity and inclusion are experiencing greater innovation, productivity, engagement, and employee satisfaction. We are committed to increasing gender and ethnic diversity throughout Dell Technologies and, as part of our 2030 Plan, have established goals focused on this objective. We seek to achieve the following diversity goals within our workforce (excluding employees of Secureworks):
•By 2030, 50% of our global workforce and 40% of our global people leaders will be those who self-identify as women. 
•By 2030, 25% of our U.S. workforce and 15% of our U.S. people leaders will be those who self-identify as Black or African American or as Hispanic or Latino. 
We seek to meet these goals by:
•building and attracting the future workforce to create a workplace that is accessible, equitable and attractive to a diverse talent pipeline;
•developing and retaining an empowered workforce to foster an internal community that is engaged, productive, and innovative; and
•expanding our impact beyond our four walls, to build stronger customer relationships and external community that recognizes, respects and embraces our shared value.
We still have work to do, and plan to provide transparency into our progress via annual reporting available on the social impact reporting page of our website.
Achievement through Learning, Development, and Total Rewards — We offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits package and strive to provide the best choice and value at the best cost. Our comprehensive rewards programs are designed to attract, reward, and retain high-quality talent and to inspire employees to be their best and do their best work for our customers and the growth of our business. We recognize and reward performance through awards aligned with business strategy and individual objectives while supporting team members’ mental, physical, and financial health, and promoting workplace flexibility and connection. Further, Dell Technologies’ focus on cultivating inclusion is an important component of our total rewards philosophy — we believe that equal pay is a business imperative and we are committed to it.
We provide a multitude of programs to enhance employees’ career growth and development. We offer formal training options, individualized development programs and sponsorship, tools for 360-degree feedback, mentoring, networking, stretch assignments, and growth opportunities. Our programs are designed to empower and inspire employees to direct their own career paths and build a portfolio of valuable skills for success in the technology industry. We are committed to building a diverse leadership pipeline with a broad spectrum of skills, including the ability to lead with integrity and inspire others. 
Balance and Wellness — Work flexibility is part of our culture and has been critical to our success throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Dell Technologies has built tools and a culture that provide choice and flexibility to employees, the majority of whom continue to work in a mostly virtual environment. Dell’s Connected Workplace program allows eligible employees to choose from a variety of flexible work arrangement options that best meet their needs and is now available in 84 countries globally. We have implemented pandemic-specific protocols for employees whose jobs require them to be on-site or with customers and are deploying return-to-site processes based on ongoing assessments of local conditions. 
We support our employees’ wellness through a comprehensive approach focused on mental, physical, and financial health, flexibility, and connection. We provide wellness resources to help employees and their families develop and sustain healthy habits. We further support employee wellness via regular communications, virtual live and on-demand educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, paid personal wellness time, and other incentives.
Connection and Engagement — We believe that employee feedback is an important part of our culture and how we drive our strategy. Through our annual Tell Dell survey, employees can confidentially voice their perceptions of our Company, their work experience, and ways in which Dell Technologies can improve. We drive further employee engagement and connection through a variety of initiatives including, but not limited to, our member listening strategy and our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”). We have a total of 13 unique ERGs, such as the Black Networking Alliance, Women in Action, and Planet. Our ERGs cultivate inclusion and bring many collective voices together for a greater business impact. Our ERGs also provide personal and professional development through networking opportunities, mentoring, volunteerism, and community involvement.
Supply Chain Resources
We manage our responsible business practices in one of the world’s largest supply chains, which involves hundreds of thousands of people around the world. We continue our efforts to drive responsible manufacturing through robust assurance practices including human rights due diligence and environmental stewardship. We recognize that looking after the wellbeing of people in our supply chain is important and have set goals for our work in this area, including:
•providing healthy work environments;
•delivering future-ready skills development for employees in our supply chain; and
•continuing our engagement with the people who make our products.
We support supplier employees at all levels with training on key topics, including forced labor and health and safety, and we continue to work with suppliers to deliver training directly to employees via their mobile phones. Through this program, Dell Technologies covers the cost of developing training modules and shares training costs with suppliers who deliver them. 
Dell Technologies works to ensure that we and our suppliers manufacture our products responsibly, in part through our social and environmental responsibility assurance program. Through audits conducted under this program, we seek to monitor a supplier factory’s adherence to the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct. Audits are conducted by third-party auditors that have been trained and certified by the RBA. The audits cover topics across five areas: labor, including risks of forced labor and weekly working hours; employee health and safety; environment; ethics; and management systems. Through our audit program, we aim to identify and solve concerns in our supply chain, and seek continuous improvements to address issues and enable suppliers to build their own in-house capabilities. We supplement our audits with targeted assessments of suppliers when we identify opportunities to drive further improvements.
Our supply chain sustainability progress is available through annual reporting on the social impact reporting page of our website.
