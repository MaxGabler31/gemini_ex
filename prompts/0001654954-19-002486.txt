 Overview
  
 Technology has become an essential feature of the modern life. Personal computers, printers, tablets, smartphones, digital cameras, connected entertainment systems, intelligent virtual assistants, home automation systems, and smart home appliances have become ubiquitous. Each year, these products become more feature-rich, offering many new capabilities. Consumers and small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) now depend on such technology for “must-have” information, communication, and entertainment as well as for tasks and activities in their daily lives.
  
 Technology has also become increasingly connected, with networks commonplace in the home as well as the office, and with the Internet of Things (“IoT”) adding a diverse array of devices that monitor, track and automate the physical world. At the same time, technology has become increasingly mobile, with anytime/anywhere access to voice, data, video and applications becoming commonplace.
  
 The complexity of this environment creates challenges for customer support organizations. It results in more difficult problems to solve, often including the need to support third-party products. The growth in the number and range of connected devices, the increasingly inter-connected nature of these devices, and the related complex ecosystem compels customer support organizations to use expert agents, smart, integrated tools, and analytics to fundamentally transform how support is delivered.
  
 Moreover, consumers aspire to get the most out of their technology and are often frustrated with the growing number of connected devices and the related inter-operability challenges. They need assistance with selectively installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting their devices, and they need support anytime, anywhere, and delivered any way they want it – self-support or live agent, desktop or mobile.
  
 Support.com is a full spectrum leader in technical support solutions for businesses and consumers, helping people get the most out of their tech. Support.com offers outsourced call center tech support services, and cloud-based call center software to businesses that sell, manufacture, or maintain PCs, Macs, mobile devices, and other connected devices. Our skilled US-based workforce delivers high quality, turnkey support solutions, including presale and post-sale support across all devices in the connected home. Our customers include retailers, Internet Service Providers/MSO’s, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and warranty providers. We’re the power behind major brands, helping them grow revenue, reduce costs, and delight their customers. In addition, our expert tech support agents and desktop software solutions are also available to help individuals and small businesses install, maintain, and troubleshoot their PCs, Macs, mobile devices, and connected devices — 24/7, 365 days a year. 
 
 
 Support.com is the leading technology support company offering a full “Spectrum of Support,” ranging from intuitive self-help diagnostic and solution tools known as “Guided Paths®”, to chats or calls with live, professionally trained U.S. based technology support agents.  Guided Paths® help consumers solve the most common technology issues on their own, and are ideal for consumers that prefer accessing curated easy to find and follow self-help before contacting a support agent.  For problems requiring additional assistance, our platform enables consumers to immediately reach an agent via chat or phone call.  By including robust and effective self-help in our turnkey support programs, we are able to offer our customers a lower-cost solution to customer support than models based entirely off of personal agent interaction, while simultaneously improving the consumer support experience.

 Our objective is to become the leading technology support provider utilizing innovative self-help through the ongoing creation and refinement of our Guided Paths®, the software included in our Support.com Cloud offering and the service of professionally trained U.S.-based agents.  We offer our turnkey, outsourced support services for service providers, retailers, OEMs, and warranty providers, IoT solution providers and other technology companies. Our customer support services programs are designed for both the consumer and SMB markets, and include pre-purchased concierge advice, device set-up, trouble shooting, security and support, virus and malware removal, wireless network set-up, and home security and automation system support. Most of our customer support specialists work from their homes rather than in brick-and-mortar facilities.
  
 In addition to providing our services directly to customers, we also make our software and services available to other companies. Our Support.com Cloud offering is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solution for companies to optimize support interactions with their customers using their own or third party support personnel. The solution enables companies to quickly resolve complex technology issues for their customers, boosting support agent productivity, providing ease of use for customer self-service, and dramatically improving the customer support experience.
  
  Our Support Service Programs
  
 Support.com® support services are distributed through partners, using the partner’s brand or in referral programs using the Support.com® brand.  Partners include broadband providers, retailers, OEMs, software providers, internet services providers and warranty providers.  The services programs include access to our library of Guided Paths®; one-time services (“incidents”), subscriptions, and bundled components of broader offerings.
  
 For connected home technology and automation systems, we offer a complete range of services to help customers select, set up, configure and use new systems, including helping consumers personalize system settings to meet specific lifestyle needs.
  
 We offer a variety of troubleshooting, installation, set-up and enablement services for computers, peripherals, mobile devices and gaming systems and their connectivity. We identify, diagnose and repair technical problems, including issues associated with viruses, spyware, and other forms of malware, connectivity issues, and issues with software applications.  We create new user accounts, configure automatic system updates, remove unnecessary trial software, connect devices to the cloud, find and install applications, and synchronize data among devices. These services cover a wide variety of devices, regardless of manufacturer. Support is provided for devices including personal computer, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, gaming systems and other connected devices.  Our smartphone and tablet services include configuring mobile devices for wireless network (WiFi) access, setting up email, and educating customers on how to browse the Internet and install apps. We secure and repair problems with wireless networks. We configure, connect and establish secure connections among computers, the wireless network and supported devices.  We provide outsourced IT services to SMBs including technology assessments, equipment and service selection, procurement, installation, monitoring and ongoing support for customer’s networking, backup, mobile, telephony, server, software, license management and other technology needs.
  
 We deliver our services using our proprietary agent facing and consumer self-help diagnostic tools known as Guided Paths® and technology support specialists who work from their homes rather than in brick and mortar facilities. Our library of Guided Paths® is constantly growing and under refinement as new devices and systems enter the market or receive software updates.  Our technology specialists are recruited, tested, hired and trained on a virtual basis using proprietary methods and remote technology.
  
  Our Support.com Cloud Offering
  
 Our cloud-based software is the Company’s offering in the Support Interaction Optimization (SIO) space. Support.com Cloud is a SaaS offering that provides significant levels of automation and analytics that enable companies to deliver superior customer support issue resolution while improving both the customer experience and operational performance. Based on insights from supporting millions of connected technology transactions annually, our software architecture is designed to enable resolving problems in a consistent manner by using proprietary, automated workflow while capturing rich data for service delivery optimization. Flexible architecture means that companies can take advantage of additional functionality as their business requirements change, and can add richer analytics, marketing and subscription management, and third-party applications to resolve issues.

 Key features of our Support.com Cloud offering include:
  
 Smart Guidance. Guided Paths® codify the organization’s best practices and ensures that agents and customers get the right guidance at the right time to help resolve customer problems. Guided Paths go beyond knowledge articles and decision trees. Guided paths are configured to gather contextual information and pertinent device data and to automate time-consuming, multi-step activities in ways that lead to effective and consistent problem resolution and satisfied customers.
  
 Blended Support Capability. A context engine tracks and analyzes information about what the end-customer is trying to achieve and about what activities they have already taken to help themselves. This context is maintained across support channels – for instance, if the customer escalates from self-service to assisted support - and leads to a seamless blended support experience and reduced customer effort, overcoming one of the most frequent customer complaints about customer support experiences.
  
 Remote Support Tools. A set of advanced tools including remote access, screen co-browsing, on-screen assistance, and SeeSupport - remote video support using the customer’s smart phone as a camera - is available to support representatives enabling them to quickly and effectively troubleshoot technical problems.
  
 Data and Analytics.  Our cloud-based data architecture can bring “Big Data” benefits to technology support, delivering business insights from rich data captured during service delivery and enabling organizations to track program performance and identify potential issues and inefficiencies.
  
 Web-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  Open APIs enable integration with other contact center applications (such as ticketing systems, CRM platforms or knowledge bases) so that our Support.com Cloud applications can be fully integrated into the agent-customer interaction. The open API’s allow for data transfer and sharing between applications.
  
  Our End-User Software Products
  
 Our end-user software products are designed to maintain, optimize and secure computers and mobile devices. Certain software products are licensed on a perpetual basis while others are offered on a subscription basis.
  
 Our principal software products include products designed for malware protection and removal (SUPERAntiSpyware®) and personal computer, smartphone and tablet maintenance and optimization (Cosmos®).

  Sales and Marketing
  
 Technology Support Services.   We sell our services principally through partners. Our partners include leading communication providers, retailers, warranty providers and technology companies. We acquire partners through our business development organization, and we support partners through our account management organization.  Our partnerships typically begin with a pilot phase and can take several weeks to more than a year to progress to a broader roll-out. We typically provide wholesale services to our partners on a per-incident, per-subscription or labor rate basis and our partners bundle our services with their own to their customers – consumers and SMBs.  In these partnerships, the services are generally sold under the partner’s brand.
  
 Support.com Cloud Offering.  We license Support.com Cloud applications separately from support services provided by our customer support specialists.  In such an arrangement, customers receive the right to use our cloud-based software in their own support organization, using a SaaS model under which customers pay us on a per-user or a per-session basis during the term of the arrangement. We also provide implementation services to customers, typically covering integration of our software with other customer’s systems. We charge for these services on a time-and-materials basis or as part of a fixed-fee package.
  
 We acquire Support.com Cloud customers through our direct sales channel, which uses a variety of Internet-based lead generation strategies and industry presence marketing to drive demand.  We also acquire customers through our partner channels.
  
 End-User Software Products.  We license our end-user software products directly to customers and through partners. To date, a majority of our end-user software revenue has come through direct sales to customers. Online advertising allows customers to click through to our software offerings where they can order and download our products on demand. In addition to fully featured software products available for a license fee, a substantial percentage of our end-user software revenue arises from customers who download free trial versions of our software or free versions of our software with limited functionality before making a purchase decision.
  
  Research and Development
  
 We maintain dedicated research and development teams in Sunnyvale, California, and Eugene, Oregon. Research and development expense was $2.8 million in 2018 and $3.0 million in 2017.
  
 We develop, maintain, and continue to improve proprietary, market-leading, cloud-based technologies that are essential to our business. We focus our investment in research and development across the following major areas: the creation and refinement of our Guided Paths® library; solutions for support interaction optimization; endpoint applications and other extensions to gather data to assist support interactions and allow remote support when necessary; business analytics and reporting; open application interfaces; and internal service delivery management tools.
  
 Our SaaS technology includes Guided Paths® automated workflows, remote control of customer devices, automated device and systems data collection, and business analytics.
  
 The service delivery management tools used by our agents for technology support services include our own Support.com cloud-based software capabilities and other contact center applications such as customer relationship management (“CRM”), ticketing, ordering, methods of payment, and telephony, which are all integrated into highly effective and efficient application for our technology specialists.
  
 For business analytics and reporting, we build and maintain a data warehouse that securely aggregates and restructures data from all of our applications to create a comprehensive view of the service delivery lifecycle, as well as data about the disposition of support interactions.  This rich data set provides visibility into sales conversion effectiveness, service delivery efficiency, service level performance, subscription utilization, partner program performance and many other aspects of running and optimizing our business.  Our partners also receive reports and analytic information from the warehouse for their programs on a regular basis via secure data feeds.

 Open application interfaces of our Support.com Cloud enable integration with CRM, ticketing systems, and other contact center applications.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 We own the registered trademarks SUPPORT.COM®, GUIDED PATHS®, PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS®, BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS® and NEXUS® in the United States for specified support services and software, and we have registrations and common law rights for several related trademarks in the U.S. and certain other countries. We own the domain name Support.com and additional other domain names. We also retain exclusive rights to our proprietary services technology, and our end user software products. In addition, we hold non-exclusive rights to sell and distribute certain other software products.
  
 We own two U.S. patents related to our business and have a number of pending patent applications covering certain advanced technology. Our issued patents include U.S. Patent No. 8,020,190 (“Enhanced Browser Security”) and U.S. Patent No. 6,754,707 (“Secure Computer Support System”). However, we do not know if our current patent applications or any future patent application will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. Also, we do not know whether any patents we have or may receive will be challenged or invalidated. It is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as they do in the United States, and our competitors may develop technology that competes with ours but nevertheless does not infringe our intellectual property rights.
  
 We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights that are not protected by patents. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants involved in product development. We generally require our employees, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our business. Also, we generally require employees and contractors to agree to assign and surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate while working for us in the scope of employment. These precautions, and our efforts to register and protect our intellectual property, may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
  
  Competition
  
 We are active in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Although we do not believe there is one principal competitor for all aspects of our offerings, we do compete with a number of other vendors.
  
 With respect to partnerships for our technology support services, our competitors include privately-held companies focused on premium technology services, providers of electronics warranties, emerging IoT technology support providers, global business process outsourcing providers or contact centers focused on technical support and other companies who offer technical support through partners. We believe the principal competitive factors in our services market include: pricing; breadth and depth of service offerings; quality of the customer experience; proprietary technology; time to market; account management; vendor reputation; scale; and financial resources.
  
 With respect to licenses of our Support.com Cloud offering, our competitors include companies focused on service desk, knowledge management, remote support and IT process automation. We believe the principal competitive factors in the Support Interaction Optimization (“SIO”) space include breadth and depth of functionality; ease of implementation; performance; scalability; pricing; vendor reputation; financial resources; and customer support.  We believe that our Support.com Cloud offering can compete favorably because it provides an integrated solution for SIO that covers different areas of functionality required by customers.
  
 In the market for our end-user software products, we face direct competition from software vendors, application providers, operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers, and other OEMs that may provide similar solutions and function in their products, and from individuals and groups who offer “free” and open source utilities online.

 The competitors in our markets for services and software can have some or all of the following competitive advantages: longer operating histories, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, greater engineering and technical resources, greater sales and marketing resources, stronger strategic alliances and distribution channels, larger user bases, products with different functions and feature sets and greater brand recognition than we have. We expect new competitors to continue to enter the markets in which we operate.

  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,035 employees, of whom 1,942 were work-from-home agents and 93 were corporate employees. In addition to our work-from-home employees, we also use contract labor.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
