ITEM 1. | Business
------------+---------

General Overview
 
Shineco, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through the operating entities established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily the variable interest entities (the “VIEs”). We do not have any equity ownership of the VIEs, instead we receive the economic benefits of the VIEs’ business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of our Delaware holding company that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities could decline or become worthless.
 
We use our subsidiaries and the VIEs’ vertically and horizontally integrated production, distribution, and sales channels to provide plant-based health and well-being focused products. Our products are only sold domestically in China. We utilize modern engineering technologies and biotechnologies to produce, among other products, Chinese herbal medicines, organic agricultural produce, and specialized textiles. Our health and well-being focused plant-based products business is divided into the following three major segments:
 
Processing and distributing traditional Chinese herbal medicine products as well as other pharmaceutical products - This segment was conducted through Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Ankang Longevity Group”), a Chinese company formerly under contractual arrangement with the Company which operates 66 cooperative retail pharmacies throughout Ankang Longevity Group, a city in southern Shaanxi province, China, through which we sold directly to individual customers traditional Chinese medicinal products produced by us as well as by third parties. Ankang Longevity Group also owned a factory specializing in decoction, which was the process by which solid materials are heated or boiled in order to extract liquids, and distributed decoction products to wholesalers and pharmaceutical companies around China.
 
On June 8, 2021, Tenet-Jove entered into a Restructuring Agreement with various parties. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, (i) the Company transferred all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity Group to Yushe County Guangyuan Forest Development Co., Ltd. (“Guangyuan”)’s Shareholders in exchange for Guangyuan Shareholders entering into VIE agreements with Tenet-Jove, which composes of one group of similar identifiable assets; (ii) Tenet-Jove entered a Termination Agreement with Ankang Longevity Group and the Ankang Longevity Group Shareholders; (iii) as a consideration to the Restructuring Agreement and based on a valuation report on the equity interests of Guangyuan issued by an independent third party, Tenet-Jove relinquished all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity Group and transferred those rights and interests to the Guangyuan Shareholders; and (iv) Guangyuan and the Guangyuan Shareholders entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Tenet-Jove. After signing of the Restructuring Agreement, the Company and the shareholders of Ankang Longevity Group and Guangyuan actively carried out the transferring of rights and interests in Ankang Longevity Group and Guangyuan, and the transferring was completed subsequently on July 5, 2021. Afterwards, with the completion of all other follow-ups works, on August 16, 2021, the Company, through its subsidiary Tenet-Jove, completed the previously announced acquisition pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement dated June 8, 2021. The management determined that July 5, 2021 was the disposal date of Ankang Longevity Group. The assets and liabilities of the entities of Ankang Longevity Group have been reclassified as “assets of discontinued operations” and “liabilities of discontinued operations” within current and non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. The results of operations of Ankang Longevity Group have been reclassified to “net loss from discontinued operations” in the consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
 
Processing and distributing green and organic agricultural produce as well as growing and cultivating yew trees (taxus media) - We currently cultivate and sell yew mainly to group and corporate customers, but do not currently process yew into Chinese or Western medicines. This segment is conducted through the following VIEs: Qingdao Zhihesheng Agricultural Produce Services, Ltd (“Qingdao Zhihesheng”). Meanwhile, we entered the market of planting fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees through the newly acquired VIE, Guangyuan. The operations of this segment are located in the North regions of Mainland China, mostly carried out in Shanxi Province.
 
Providing domestic air and overland freight forwarding services - We currently provide domestic air and overland freight forwarding services by outsourcing these services to a third party. This segment is conducted through our Zhisheng VIE, Yantai Zhisheng International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd (“Zhisheng Freight”).
 
Developing and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles, and other byproducts derived from an indigenous Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum, grown in the Xinjiang region of China, and known in Chinese as “Luobuma” or “bluish dogbane” - Our Luobuma products are specialized textile and health supplement products designed to incorporate traditional Eastern medicines with modern scientific methods. These products are predicated on centuries-old traditions of Eastern herbal remedies derived from the Luobuma raw material. This segment is channeled through our directly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet-Jove”), and its 90% subsidiary Tianjin Tenet Huatai Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet Huatai”).

Corporate Structure
 
The chart below depicts the corporate structure of the Company as of the date of this prospectus.
 

There are a number of uncertainties regarding the status of the rights of the Delaware holding company with respect to its contractual arrangements with the VIEs, its founders and owners, including whether the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual agreements due to uncertainties under Chinese law and jurisdictional limits.
 
Contractual Arrangements with Each VIE
 
Shineco conducts its business through a combination of contractual arrangements with PRC operating companies and equity ownership of PRC subsidiaries. Shineco uses contractual relationships since a direct investment by foreign-owned companies like Shineco is prohibited or restricted under the PRC laws because of the respective industries the four VIEs are in. Where Shineco operates its business through such contractual relationships, it is subject to risks related to such operation.
 
The principal regulation governing foreign ownership of businesses in the PRC is the Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue, effective as of April 10, 2015 (the “Catalogue”). The Catalogue classifies various industries into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Shineco is engaged in businesses and industries where direct foreign investment is expressly prohibited: the preparation of traditional Chinese medicines in small pieces ready for decoction.
 
Due, in part, to the regulations on foreign ownership of PRC businesses, neither Shineco nor our subsidiaries own any equity interest in the Zhisheng Group, with which Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co., Ltd., a Chinese company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Shineco (“WFOE”) has entered into one set of VIE agreements respectively with each following Chinese operating companies: Zhisheng Biotech, Yantai Zhisheng and Zhihesheng. In addition, as a result of the Restructuring Agreement dated June 8, 2021, WFOE entered into the series of VIE agreements with Guangyuan Forest and its shareholders on the same date. Instead of direct ownership, Shineco receives the economic benefits of each VIEs’ business operations through a series of contractual arrangements. WFOE, each of the four VIEs and their shareholders have entered into a series of contractual arrangements, also known as VIE Agreements.

Each set of the VIE Agreements is described below and consist of, for each of the Zhisheng Group and Guangyuan, (a) exclusive business cooperation agreements, (b) equity interest pledge agreements, (c) exclusive option agreements, and (d) powers of attorney. As an overview, these agreements taken together are designed to allow Shineco to manage the operations of each of the VIEs and to receive all of the net income of such VIEs in return therefor. To secure WFOE’s interest in the VIEs, the equity interest pledges and option agreements and the powers of attorney are designed to allow WFOE to step in and convert its contractual interest into an equity interest in the event we determine that doing so is warranted.
 
The following is a summary of the common contractual arrangements that enable us to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the four VIEs’ operations for accounting purposes under U.S. GAAP.
 
Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements
 
WFOE entered into an Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement with Zhisheng Biotech, Yantai Zhisheng, Zhihesheng, and Guangyuan Forest on February 24, 2014, June 16, 2011, May 24, 2012, and June 8, 2021, respectively. WFOE is currently managing each VIE pursuant to the terms of each of the four Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements.
 
Pursuant to substantially identical Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements between each VIE and WFOE, WFOE provides each VIE with technical support, consulting services and other management services relating to its day-to-day business operations and management, on an exclusive basis, utilizing its advantages in technology, human resources, and information. Additionally, each VIE has granted an irrevocable and exclusive option to WFOE to purchase from such VIE, any or all of its assets, to the extent permitted under applicable PRC law. WFOE may exercise, at its sole discretion, the option to purchase from each VIE any or all of such VIE’s assets at the lowest purchase price permitted by PRC law. Should WFOE exercise such option, the parties shall enter into a separate asset transfer or similar agreement. WFOE shall own all intellectual property rights that are developed during the course of each Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. For services rendered to each VIE by WFOE under the agreement to which such VIE is a party, WFOE is entitled to collect a service fee calculated based on the time of services rendered multiplied by the corresponding rate, which is approximately equal to the net income of such VIE.
 
Each Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement shall remain in effect for ten years until it is extended or terminated by WFOE, which may be done unilaterally, except in the case of gross negligence or fraud, in which case the VIE may terminate the agreements. Pursuant to each such agreement, WFOE has absolute authority relating to the management of each VIE, including but not limited to decisions with regard to expenses, salary raises and bonuses, hiring, firing and other operational functions. Although the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements do not prohibit related party transactions, the audit committee of Shineco will be required to review and approve in advance any related party transactions, including transactions involving WFOE or any VIE. To continue the contractual relationship with Zhihesheng, WFOE entered into an amendment dated April 24, 2022 to the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement with Zhihesheng to extend the term of such Agreement for additional twenty (20) years from May 23, 2022. Similarly, to continue the contractual relationship with Yantai Zhisheng, WFOE entered into an amendment dated June 1, 2021 to the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement with Yantai Zhisheng to extend the term of such Agreement for additional twenty (20) years from June 15, 2021.
 
Equity Interest Pledge Agreements
 
Under the Equity Interest Pledge Agreements among the WFOE, each VIE and each group of shareholders of the VIE, the shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in each such VIE to WFOE to guarantee the performance of such VIE’s obligations under the respective Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. Under the terms of each agreement, in the event that the VIE or its shareholders breach their respective contractual obligations under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement to which they are a party, WFOE, as pledgee, will be entitled to certain rights, including, but not limited to, the right to collect dividends generated by the pledged equity interests. Each VIE’s shareholders also agreed that upon occurrence of any event of default, as set forth in the applicable Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, WFOE is entitled to dispose of the pledged equity interest in accordance with applicable PRC laws. Each VIE’s shareholders further agree not to dispose of the pledged equity interests or take any actions that would prejudice WFOE’s interest in the applicable VIE.

-

 

Each Equity Interest Pledge Agreement shall be effective until all payments due under the related Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement have been paid by the VIE party thereto. WFOE shall cancel or terminate an Equity Interest Pledge Agreement upon a VIE’s full payment of fees payable under its applicable Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement.
 
Exclusive Option Agreements
 
Under the Exclusive Option Agreements, shareholders of each VIE irrevocably granted WFOE (or its designee) an exclusive option to purchase, to the extent permitted under PRC law, once or at multiple times, at any time, part or all of their equity interests in each VIE. The option price is equal to the capital paid in by the applicable VIE shareholders subject to any appraisal or restrictions required by applicable PRC laws and regulations. The option purchase price shall increase in case the applicable VIE shareholders make additional capital contributions to such VIE.
 
Each agreement remains effective for a term of ten years and may be unilaterally renewed at WFOE’s election. WFOE, Zhihesheng and all of the shareholders of Zhihesheng entered into an amendment dated April 25, 2022 to the Exclusive Option Agreement to extend the term of such Agreement for additional twenty (20) years from May 23, 2022. Yantai Zhisheng, WFOE and all of the shareholders of Yantai Zhisheng entered into an amendment dated June 1, 2021 to the Exclusive Option Agreement with Yantai Zhisheng to extend the term of such Agreement for additional twenty (20) years from June 15, 2021.
 
Powers of Attorney
 
Under the Powers of Attorney, the shareholders of each VIE authorize WFOE to act on their behalf as their exclusive agent and attorney with respect to all rights as shareholders of the respective VIEs, including but not limited to: (a) attending shareholders’ meetings; (b) exercising all the shareholder’s rights, including voting, that shareholders are entitled to under the laws of China and the Articles of Association, including but not limited to the sale or transfer or pledge or disposition of shares in part or in whole; and (c) designating and appointing on behalf of shareholders the legal representative, the executive director, supervisor, the chief executive officer and other senior management members of the respective VIEs.
 
Summary of challenges and risks involved in the VIE Arrangements and enforcing the VIE Agreements
 
Because Shineco does not hold equity interests in the VIEs, we are subject to risks due to the uncertainty of the interpretation and application of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to regulatory review of oversea listing of PRC companies through a special purpose vehicle, and the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangement with the VIEs. We are also subject to the risks of the uncertainty that the PRC government could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors, and the value of our shares of common stock may depreciate significantly. The arrangements of VIE Agreements are less effective than direct ownership due to the inherent risks of the VIE structure and that Shineco may have difficulty in enforcing any rights it may have under the VIE agreements with the VIEs, its founders and shareholders in the PRC because all of the VIE agreements are governed by the PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC, where the legal environment is uncertain and not as developed as in the United States, and where the Chinese government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of Shineco’s business and may intervene or influence Shineco’s operations at any time with little advance notice, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of your common stock. Furthermore, these VIE agreements may not be enforceable in China if the PRC authorities or courts take a view that such VIE agreements contravene with the PRC laws and regulations or are otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event we are unable to enforce these VIE Agreements, Shineco may not be able to derive economic benefits from the VIEs and Shineco’s ability to conduct its business may be materially and adversely affected. Any references to economic benefits that accrue to Shineco because of the VIEs are limited to, and subject to conditions we have satisfied for consolidation of the VIEs under U.S. GAAP. The VIEs are consolidated for accounting purposes but none of them is an entity in which Shinceco owns equity. Shineco does not conduct any active operations and is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs for accounting purposes. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure”, “Risk Factors — Risks Associated With Doing Business in China” and “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Investment in Our Common Stock” for more information.
 
Asset Transfer and Dividend Distribution Among Shineco, its Subsidiaries and the VIEs
 
As of the date of this prospectus, Shineco, any of its subsidiaries or any of the VIEs have not distributed any earnings or settled any amounts owed under the VIE Agreements. None of Shineco, its subsidiaries and the VIEs have the intention to distribute earnings on any corporate level nor settle amounts owed under the VIE agreements in the near future. We intend to keep any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future.
 
However, under our current corporate structure of mixed ownership and VIE arrangement, the WFOE has paid some of Shineco’s expenses and Shineco has from time to time transferred cash to WFOE to fund WFOE and other subsidiaries’ or VIEs’ operations. For the year ended June 30, 2022, Shineco transferred cash in the total amount of $3,719,606 to WFOE and WFOE paid expense approximately $1,559,819 on behalf of Shineco. For the year ended June 30, 2021, Shineco transferred cash in the aggregate amount of $787,885 to the WFOE and WFOE paid $636,887 to Shineco’s creditors on behalf of Shineco. The assets transfer was for business operation purposes. There was no distribution of earnings by the PRC operating subsidiaries to Shineco during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Under the existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the “SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. Pursuant to the SAFE Circular 37, Shineco is allowed to pay dividends in foreign currencies to WFOE without prior approval from the SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the PRC shall comply with certain procedures under the PRC foreign exchange regulations applicable to PRC residents only. Approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is, however, required where RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for Shineco’s accounts with little advance notice.

Product Descriptions
 
Yew Trees, fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees
 
Currently, through our Zhisheng Group VIEs, we sell ornamental yew trees and yew cuttings to third parties. We also rent ornamental yew trees to companies who desire the environmental benefits of natural plants in their workplaces. Until recently we were primarily engaged in the production, distribution and sale of agricultural products, including the planting and processing of organic fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, eggplants, string beans, peppers as well as certain popular fruits in China like blueberries and wine grapes, but those operations have been temporarily scaled back due to stiff competition and a change of our internal policy in favor of the expansion of our yew tree business.
 
As our inventories of young yew trees mature, our long-term goals are particularly focused on the extraction of paclitaxel or taxol, which is derived from certain species of yew trees including those we grow. Taxol, a broad-spectrum mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy, can be extracted from mature yew trees. As a mitotic inhibitor, taxol adheres to rapidly dividing cancerous cells during mitosis (cell division) and interferes with the division process. It may suppress tumor growth through regulating microtubule stabilization, inducing apoptosis and adjusting immunologic mechanism. Taxol is also used for the prevention of restenosis, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. In the treatment of certain soft tissue cancers, such as breast cancer, taxol is given for early stage and metastatic breast cancer after combination anthracycline and cytoxan therapy and is also given as treatment to shrink a tumor before surgery. It can also be used together with a drug called Cisplatin to treat advanced ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, or “NSCLC.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved taxol as the primary and secondary treatment for NSCLC. There are other generally accepted protocols for the use of taxol as a cancer drug alone or in combination with other drugs depending upon the diagnosis, staging and type of cancer, as well as a patient’s medical history, tolerances and allergies, among other relevant factors. Taxol is usually sold to large pharmaceutical companies to be used in their products, which can be used to treat patients with lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck cancer, and advanced forms of Kaposi’s sarcoma.
 
Meanwhile, we entered the market of planting fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees through the newly acquired VIE, Guangyuan. The operations of this segment are located in the North regions of Mainland China, mostly carried out in Shanxi Province.

Tenet-Jove Textiles
 
Our company’s scientists and other Chinese researchers have brought modern scientific methods to the study of Luobuma, and have determined that Luobuma fibers have an increased tendency to radiate light at the “far infrared” end of the light spectrum, with wavelengths measuring between 8-15 microns (referred to as “FIR”). Based on Chinese scientific studies some believe that Luobuma’s FIR-radiating qualities exert a positive effect on various functions of the human body, including cellular metabolism. For this reason, we have marketed and sold these products utilizing such technology. These products are popular with Chinese customers seeking the perceived benefits of traditional Chinese medicine.
 
For example, according to a report by the College of Science of Tianjin University, tests conducted by the PRC’s National Institute of Metrology have reported that the radiance rate of far infrared light from Luobuma fiber is 84%, 2 to 4 times higher than that from cotton and other natural fibers. The same tests found that the FIR radiance rate from our proprietary bio-ceramic powder reaches 91%. Healthful benefits have been observed at radiance rate levels above 70%. Based on these observations about FIR radiance, we have developed textiles that our customers can wear and from which we believe they can receive those health benefits commonly associated with Chinese herbal remedies.
 
Tenet-Jove first commercially developed the natural FIR-radiant properties of the Luobuma plant in 1997. We refer to this natural Luobuma fiber as a “Second Generation” FIR textile. The “First Generation” of FIR-radiant textiles initially became popular in China around 1989, when manufacturers learned to add 3% of a FIR-radiant inorganic material to synthetic fibers comparable to nylon or polyester. This “First Generation” FIR material employs a relatively low level of technology and has relatively few perceived or measurable health benefits. The “Second Generation” FIR textiles we have developed are softer, smoother and more breathable natural fibers that are not as prone to static electricity as the low technology “First Generation” FIR-radiant textiles.
 
Our Luobuma fabrics have been a success in the Chinese domestic market and have also received numerous awards. The technology applied to our Luobuma-based FIR Therapeutic Clothing and Textile Products has received a “Special Golden Award” from the China National Intellectual Property Bureau at China’s National Patent and Brand Expo. Our products under the brand name of “Tenethealth” have also been honored with the title of “Consumer’s Favorite Products” by the Chinese Consumer Association.
 
The fibers of natural Luobuma FIR materials can contain up to 32 medicinal compounds, many of which are familiar to practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, our processes for manufacturing Luobuma textiles produce a fabric that is smooth, air-permeable, and soft. By combining a product that is familiar to PRC consumers seeking the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine with quality and comfort, we believe we are innovative and have chosen a product that has great commercial potential in the Chinese textile market.
 
Tenet-Jove Product Development
 
We have developed what we term a “Third Generation” of FIR textiles under a contract with the Institute of Process Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the leading scientific institutions in China. Our research and development has focused on adding nanotechnology enhancements to our Luobuma textile products, in which we use small-scale nanotechnology to embed or impregnate our Luobuma-fiber textiles with other FIR-radiant materials, bio-ceramic materials, or other Chinese herbal remedies. Using these nanotechnology methods, we have developed and marketed health-promoting textile goods that are impregnated with FIR-radiant materials or other Chinese herbal remedies, which are then absorbed through the wearer’s skin. We believe these “Third Generation” FIR textiles will better combine the health benefits of Luobuma with an even softer, more natural cotton-like fabric that will be popular with Chinese consumers.
 
The Company presently produces approximately 100 “Third Generation” FIR textile products. These textile products include:
 

● | Far Infrared bedding sets (including various pillows, comforters, and sheets); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Far Infrared underwear, T-shirts, and socks; 
● | Far Infrared knee and shin pads, waist supports and other protective clothing; and 
● | Far Infrared body wraps or protectors (for the ankle, elbow, wrist, and knee). 

 
All our textile products are made of Luobuma-based fibers and are impregnated with bio-ceramic powder, which contains various minerals such as halloysite. Both the fiber and the bio-ceramic powder are developed with the Company’s patented, proprietary techniques.

Manufacturing and Production Facilities

We have formed strategic alliances with several certified knitting and clothing manufacturers throughout China in order to produce our Luobuma products. We assign them limited manufacturing jobs and require certain conditions, including protecting our proprietary techniques and meeting our rigid quality standards.
Our Strategy for Research and Development
 

● | To keep our products proprietary and patented; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To commit to further development of our Luobuma byproducts, houpu magnolia products, and selenium-enriched herbs and plants; and 
● | To build strategic alliances with universities and scientific institutions, which will allow us exposure to advanced technologies, excellent researchers and scientists and we believe will lower the costs and timing of the development of new products. 

 
Tenet-Jove specializes in developing Luobuma products and combining FIR technology with natural herbal medicines. We estimate that there are large supplies of Luobuma in China, especially Xinjiang Province. In China, Luobuma can grow as high as 3.6 meters. In the first year after planting, Luobuma can be harvested once during that year; thereafter, it can be harvested twice per year before or at the beginning of the flowering period in June and a second time around September. Currently, we believe China’s Luobuma supplies are largely undeveloped. The Company’s future success will depend on improving its techniques to industrialize Luobuma by developing new Luobuma-derived products such as improved Luobuma functional fiber and various Luobuma nutritional supplements.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks
 
We regard our trademarks as an important part of our business due to the name recognition of our customers. Our subsidiary, Tenet-Jove, has obtained 18 trademark registrations at the China Trademark Office. As of June 30, 2022, we are not aware of any valid claim or challenges to our right to use our registered trademark or any counterfeit or other infringement to our registered trademark.
Distribution Network
 
We sell our products through various distribution networks. 
 
Our Luobuma product distribution networks consist of four distributors who distribute our products to approximately 21 outlets, including flagship stores, retail stores and sales counters. These distributors sell our products throughout mainland China, under our proprietary brand name and “Tenethealth®” trademark. We also sell our Luobuma textile products online through third party e-commerce websites, such as Taobao, Tmall and JD. Our yew trees and agricultural products are primarily sold through our sales personnel and group and institutional sales.
 
Our sales and distribution strategy for our products focuses on expanding our distribution network of retail stores and sales counters into all major provinces and cities of China. We also plan to use our current distribution network to introduce our newly developed products into target markets more efficiently and effectively.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market Luobuma to consumers primarily by highlighting its unique characteristics— the material is soft like cotton, breathable like hemp and is smooth to the touch like silk, and its FIR-radiating qualities are believed by some to exert a positive effect on various functions of the human body. Very few other companies in China are involved with Luobuma fiber production, so we are chiefly able to market our products against products of natural and man-made fibers that do not have the perceived advantages of Luobuma. The small number of companies that are involved in Luobuma fiber production are still using the traditional, outdated methods of producing Luobuma. We are the only company using advanced technologies. Tenet-Jove’s overall marketing strategy includes:

● | Brand marketing strategy, primarily through media publicity, product- and market-oriented strategy; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Distinguishing Luobuma as a high-end, technologically advanced native Chinese product; and 
● | Online advertising, which includes online advertisements appearing on the sites where we sell our products, as well as social media advertising, including Wechat, and direct e-mail solicitations.

The Zhisheng Group emphasizes the following marketing strategies:
 

● | Focusing on the advanced growing conditions provided by our modern greenhouse operations and the potential pharmaceutical byproducts of yew, especially paclitaxel or taxol; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Brand marketing to focus on our yew’s brand positioning. 

 
Currently, the Company’s sales are generated through the following five major channels:
 

1. | Retail stores and sales counters. We mainly sell our Luobuma related products through sales counters and medicine through our pharmacy chain stores. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Sales to group or institutional customers. We mainly sell our organic agricultural products and yew trees to group or corporate customers. 
3. | Seminars and conferences. Because a majority of new consumers need to learn about our new products before buying them, it becomes very important and effective for us to organize or sponsor seminars and events to present healthcare knowledge while introducing and selling our products to new users. 
4. | E-commerce. We mainly sell the Luobuma related products through Tmall and Taobao to underdeveloped regions in China, Taiwan and Macau. We are currently one of only three certified online sellers of Luobuma textile products on China’s largest online sales platform, Tmall run by Alibaba. Selling through the Internet has become increasingly important to our sales in undeveloped regions and developed cities. 

The Market
 
We primarily market our health and wellbeing-focused products in China. At present, we do not sell any of our products in the United States or Canada. On the demand side, we believe that the following four forces drive market growth in all three of our business segments:

1. | The rapid growth of China’s economy, which has produced one of the largest groups of middle-class families in the world, with the largest collective purchasing power in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that by 2030, over 70 percent of China’s population could be middle class, consuming approximately $10 trillion in goods and services. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The increase of China’s aging population. The China Census Bureau predicts that the majority of the China “baby boom” population (representing 40% of China’s total population) will be 66 or older by 2021, which represents over 500 million potential consumers of our pharmaceutical and healthcare products, the majority of which are sold to older customers. 
3. | Chinese people’s increasing attention and awareness to healthy and active lifestyles, especially in urban areas. 
4. | Chinese healthcare reforms.

--

 

We believe China’s healthcare sector has the capacity to grow in the coming years. For general consumer health products, China remains among the world’s most attractive markets, and by far the fastest-growing of all the large emerging ones. This growth is being driven by China’s aging population, increased incidence of chronic diseases, and a material increase in investment from both domestic and foreign corporations.
 
China’s healthcare market is being shaped by positive economic and demographic trends, further healthcare reform efforts, and the policies set forth in the government’s 12th five-year plan. We believe that improvements in infrastructure, the broadening of insurance coverage, and government encouragement and support for innovation will have positive implications for us and other healthcare companies.
 
Strong growth in the Chinese healthcare sector has been fueled by favorable demographic trends, continued urbanization throughout China, the overall Chinese economy’s expansion, and income growth (which encourages a greater awareness of and access to healthcare among Chinese consumers). It also reflects the Chinese government’s focus on healthcare as both a social priority (as witnessed in its late 2000s healthcare reforms) and a strategic priority (as witnessed in the 12th five-year plan’s stated focus on growing the Chinese biomedical industry).
 
Competition
 
We compete with other top-tier healthcare companies in China. Many of them are more established than we are and have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and a larger customer base. Those competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies.

There are few viable competitors producing advanced technology textile products with health benefits like our Luobuma textile products. Principally, our competitors are those that market and sell traditional textile products, such as Luolai Home Textile Co., Fuanna Bedding and Furnishing Co., Ltd., Violet Home Textile Co., and Shuixing Home Textile Co., Ltd, as well as those companies that market and sell protective clothing, like Bauerfeind Sports and Albert Medical. Luobuma is native to China, thus our ability to source raw materials locally greatly enhances our competitive position in the Chinese market for high quality textile products with perceived health benefits.
