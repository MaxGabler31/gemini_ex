 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 OVERVIEW
 
Emergent BioSolutions Inc. is a global life sciences company focused on providing specialty products for civilian and military populations that address accidental, intentional and naturally occurring public health threats.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Michigan in May 1998 and subsequently reorganized as a Delaware corporation in June 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "EBS." Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Professional Drive, Suite 400, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20879. Our telephone number is (240) 631-3200, and our website address is www.emergentbiosolutions.com.
 
Within the category of our specialty products, we are focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing medical countermeasures, or MCMs, that address public health and national security threats, which we collectively refer to as PHTs. The PHTs that we address fall into two categories: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives, or CBRNE; and emerging infectious diseases, or EID. We have a portfolio of eight products through which we generate most of our revenue, a fully-integrated portfolio of contract development and manufacturing services and a research and development pipeline of various investigational-stage product candidates. The U.S. government is the primary purchaser of our products and provides us with substantial funding for the development of many of our product candidates. Our development pipeline consists of a diversified mix of both pre-clinical and clinical-stage candidates.

GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND COLLABORATIONS
 
We have a track record of growth through the acquisition of revenue-generating and accretive products and businesses. Our goal is to continue our expansion through targeted acquisitions of (1) government-procured MCMs; (2) dual-market product opportunities, which are products that address CBRNE threats but have potential application to commercial customers (e.g., hospitals, clinics and other non-government customers); and (3) products that are purely commercial in nature but would leverage our core competencies in a unique way. Below is a summary of our significant acquisitions and collaborations over the past five years.
 
ACAM2000
 
In October 2017, we completed the acquisition of the ACAM2000® (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live) business of Sanofi Pasteur Biologics, LLC. This acquisition included ACAM2000, the only smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA, a licensed, live-viral manufacturing facility and office and warehouse space, both in Canton, Massachusetts (for which we received FDA manufacturing approval for the transfer of the upstream portion of the manufacturing process of ACAM2000 in November 2017), and a live-viral fill/finish facility in Rockville, Maryland. With this acquisition, we also acquired an existing 10-year contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, which will expire in March 2018. This contract was originally valued at up to $425 million, and upon acquisition had a remaining value at acquisition of up to approximately $160 million, including delivery of ACAM2000 to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS.
 
Total consideration for this acquisition was $125 million. At closing, we paid $117.5 million in cash. The agreement also included an additional cash milestone payment of $7.5 million based upon FDA approval of the Canton facility for the manufacturing of ACAM2000. This regulatory milestone was achieved based on such approval in November 2017 and paid in cash in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Raxibacumab
 
In October 2017, we completed the acquisition from Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline LLC, collectively GSK, of Raxibacumab, the first fully-human monoclonal antibody product licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Total consideration for this acquisition was up to $96 million. At closing, we paid $76 million in cash. The agreement also included up to $20 million in future cash payments tied to product sales and manufacturing-related milestones. As of December 31, 2017, the milestones had not yet been achieved. With the acquisition, we assumed responsibility for a multi-year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, with a remaining value at acquisition of up to approximately $130 million, to supply Raxibacumab to the SNS through November 2019. We are currently in the process of pursuing FDA licensure for the transfer of manufacturing of Raxibacumab to our Bayview facility, and under the terms of the acquisition agreements we will purchase product from GSK to enable completion of deliveries to the SNS under the current BARDA procurement contract.
Southwest Research Institute
 
In July 2017, we entered into an agreement with Southwest Research Institute, an independent, nonprofit applied research and development organization headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, under which we are developing SIAN (stabilized isoamyl nitrite) in an intra-nasal spray device for the treatment of known or suspected acute cyanide poisoning. In September 2017, we were awarded a five-year contract by BARDA valued at approximately $63 million to advance the development of SIAN towards licensure. Under this BARDA contract, we will complete regulatory activities required to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA to enable first-in-human studies, conduct initial clinical studies, and advance non-clinical and manufacturing development activities.
 
Valneva SE
 
In July 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement with Valneva SE, or Valneva, for global exclusive rights to Valneva's Zika vaccine technology, ZIKV. We are co-developing VLA1601, a highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus.
 
Unither Virology LLC
 
In December 2015, we acquired Unither Virology LLC, a glycobiology-focused drug discovery subsidiary of United Therapeutics Corporation. The primary asset of this acquisition was the UVX series of glyco-biologic molecules, a broad family of iminosugar small molecules that have activity against a variety of enveloped viruses, of which the leading product candidate is EBI-001.
Pharma Consult
 
In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Pharma Consult Ges.m.b.H of Austria to acquire rights to an auto-injector device intended for military use, which is the device platform upon which our Trobigard™ product is based. This platform was designed for needle penetration and injection through several layers of clothing and intramuscular self-injection of emergency treatment for exposure to certain nerve agents. Trobigard is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA or any similar regulatory body, and is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the United States. This product is not distributed in the United States.
Evolva Holding SA
 
In December 2014, we acquired the EV-035 series of molecules from Evolva Holding SA. EV-035 is a series of small molecules in the 4-oxoquinolizine class and targets bacterial type IIa topoisomerase. The lead molecule, GC-072, is being developed as a potential oral and IV treatment for B. pseudomallei under a four-year, $15 million contract with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, of the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD. A second antibiotic candidate, EBX-205, has been selected from the series and is currently being developed as an oral therapeutic to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection, including those caused by MRSA as well as to treat other serious bacterial infections caused by biothreat pathogens such as B. anthracis, F. tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei.
 
Cangene Corporation
 
In February 2014, we acquired Cangene Corporation, which included the following products: BAT® for the treatment of botulism; Anthrasil for the treatment of anthrax infection; and VIGIV for the treatment of adverse reactions to vaccinia virus vaccinations and hyperimmune technology platform. BAT, Anthrasil and VIGIV are all manufactured in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in our facilities acquired from Cangene. We also acquired Cangene's fill/finish contract manufacturing services business in Baltimore, Maryland (our Camden facility), including agreements with customers to fill/finish a number of commercial and clinical-stage products worldwide.
Healthcare Protective Products Division of Bracco Diagnostics Inc.
 
In August 2013, we acquired the Healthcare Protective Products Division of Bracco Diagnostics Inc. The assets acquired in this transaction included the RSDL Kit, a medical device countermeasure for the removal and neutralization of chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin, a multi-year manufacturing agreement, and the lease for our manufacturing facility in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. With this acquisition, we diversified into another pillar within the CBRNE threat countermeasure market by acquiring an MCM focused on chemical threats, specifically chemical warfare agents. The acquisition also broadened our technical expertise beyond vaccines and therapeutics into medical devices and, at the same time, expanded our CBRNE-related sales and marketing capabilities with respect to ex-U.S. customers, specifically NATO, among others.
SPIN-OFF OF BIOSCIENCES BUSINESS
 
In August 2016, we completed a tax-free spin-off of our
 former biosciences business into a separate, stand-alone publicly-traded company, Aptevo Therapeutics Inc.
 As part of the spin-off transaction, the assets that were a part of our 
former 
biosciences business segment were transferred to Aptevo. These assets included our 
former 
biosciences commercial products IXINITY [coagulation factor IX (recombinant)], WinRho® SDF [(Rho(D) Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], HepaGam B® [Hepatitis B Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] and VARIZIG® [Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (Human)] as well as our

OUR BUSINESS UNITS
 
We are organized into four business units: Vaccines and Anti-Infectives; Antibody Therapeutics; Devices; and Contract Development and Manufacturing.
 
Vaccines and Anti-Infectives
 
Our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives business unit contains a portfolio of specialty vaccines and unique anti-infectives that address existing and emerging PHTs.
 
Products
 
BioThrax® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed). BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for the general use prophylaxis, or GUP, of anthrax disease. In April 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to BioThrax for the post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, indication, (please see "Regulation – Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines– Organ Drugs"), giving it market exclusivity in the United States until November 2022. In November 2015, the FDA approved our supplemental Biologics License Application, or BLA, to expand the BioThrax label to include the PEP indication for BioThrax administered in combination with antimicrobial therapy. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the spore forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax. Death due to inhalational anthrax infection often occurs within 24-36 hours of the onset of advanced respiratory complications. BioThrax is administered in a GUP setting by intramuscular injection in a three-dose primary series over an initial six-month period. The vaccine is protective after completion of this three-dose primary series. After the primary series, two additional doses are given one each at 12 and 18 months, with booster doses annually thereafter. BioThrax is administered in a PEP setting in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs following suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure. The vaccination schedule for PEP consists of three doses of BioThrax administered subcutaneously at 0, 2 and 4 weeks post-exposure combined with antimicrobial therapy. In December 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, for the supply of up to approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS, over a five-year period ending in September 2021. The potential value of this contract is approximately $911 million, if all procurement options are exercised. In March 2017, we entered into an additional contract with BARDA, originally valued at $100 million, for the delivery of BioThrax to the SNS, over a two-year period of performance. We completed deliveries under this contract in 2017.
 
In August 2016, the FDA licensed Building 55, our large-scale manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan, for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually.
 
ACAM2000® (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live). ACAM2000 is the only smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA and is the primary smallpox vaccine designated for use in a bioterrorism emergency, with more than 230 million doses having been supplied to the SNS. ACAM2000 is also licensed in Australia and Singapore and is currently stockpiled both in the United States and internationally. Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the variola virus, a member of the orthopox virus family. According to the CDC, it is one of the most devastating diseases with a mortality rate as high as 30%. ACAM2000 is administered by percutaneous route in one dose with a bifurcated needle using the multiple puncture method. The vaccine stimulates a person's immune system to develop antibodies and cells in the blood and elsewhere that can then help the body fight off a smallpox infection if exposure to smallpox occurs. Upon the closing of the ACAM2000 acquisition, we acquired an existing 10-year CDC contract, which will expire in March 2018. The original contract, valued at up to $425 million, called for the delivery of ACAM2000 to the SNS and establishing U.S.-based manufacturing of ACAM2000, specifically the transfer of the upstream portion of the ACAM2000 production process from Austria to a U.S.-based manufacturing facility. This technology transfer was completed and approved by the FDA in November 2017. We expect to fulfill the remaining product deliveries to the SNS valued at the time of acquisition of up to approximately $160 million, subject to availability of government funding.
 
Product Candidates
 
The chart below highlights our Vaccines and Anti-infectives product candidates:
 

Product Candidate | Partner | Platform | Threat Type
-----------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+------------
NuThrax™ Next generation anthrax vaccine | HHS - BARDA | Vaccine | Biological 
VLA1601 Zika vaccine | Valneva | Vaccine | EID 
UNI-FLU Universal flu vaccine | -- | Vaccine | EID 
EBX-205 Broad spectrum antibiotic | -- | Antibacterial | EID 
GC-072 (EV-035 Series) Burkholderia antibiotic | DoD – DTRA | Antibacterial | Biological 
EBI-001 Pan-respiratory iminosugar antiviral | -- | Antiviral | EID 

 
NuThrax™ (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with CPG 7909 adjuvant). We are developing NuThrax, an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on BioThrax combined with CPG 7909, an adjuvant that we license from Pfizer Inc. We are developing NuThrax, in part with funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, and BARDA, to potentially elicit a more rapid onset of immune response using fewer doses than BioThrax while still providing protective immunity in patients. Using funds from our 2010 development contract with NIAID, in October 2014, we completed a Phase 2 safety, immunogenicity and dose ranging clinical trial of NuThrax in which all endpoints were successfully met, including requiring a fewer two-dose regimen than the BioThrax three-dose regimen and may shorten the recommended antibiotic (60-day) regimen for anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis. In September 2014, we also obtained additional funding through a five-year development contract with NIAID of up to $29 million to support the development of a dry formulation of NuThrax, including: manufacturing, assay development and non-clinical activities through the preparation of an IND application to the FDA. The dry formulation of NuThrax is intended to increase stability of the vaccine candidate at ambient and higher temperatures, with the objective of eliminating the need for cold chain during shipping and storage. In March 2015, we signed a contract with BARDA valued at $31 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. In September 2016, we signed a contract with BARDA for up to approximately $1.5 billion, including a five-year base period of performance valued initially at approximately $200 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses, subsequently modified to three million doses in March 2017, following Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, pre-approval by the FDA. Although there can be no assurances, we currently anticipate that the FDA could grant EUA designation to NuThrax as early as 2019, upon the submission of our application for EUA pre-approval, triggering the initial three million dose delivery of NuThrax into the SNS in 2019. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of NuThrax into the SNS, valued from approximately $255 million to up to $1.3 billion, respectively, and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments valued at $48 million, which if both were to be exercised in full, could increase the total contract value to approximately $1.5 billion. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations – Overview – Highlights and Business Accomplishments for 2017" for additional details.
 
Within our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives business unit, we are also leveraging our proprietary, potential broad-spectrum anti-viral and broad-spectrum antibiotic platforms to advance the development of potential dual-market molecules to address current and emerging PHTs, including the following additional investigational-stage product candidates:
 
VLA1601. We are co-developing with Valneva VLA1601, a highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus, from pre-clinical development through the completion of a Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity clinical trial. VLA1601, which has been shown to elicit functional antibody responses, is based on Valneva's established inactivated, whole virus manufacturing platform on which its licensed Japanese Encephalitis vaccine was developed and produced. A Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to commence in early 2018.
 
UNI-FLU. We are developing a universal influenza vaccine candidate intended to protect broadly against seasonal and pandemic influenza infections and without the requirement for changes to vaccine composition on an annual basis. This candidate is a nanoparticle vaccine that self-assembles during production and that displays a cross-reactive antigen for each broad influenza group.
 
EBX-205. We are developing EBX-205, a 2-pyridone antibacterial drug, as 
an oral therapeutic to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection, including those caused by MRSA.
 
GC-072. We are developing GC-072, a member of the EV-035 family of bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors, belonging to the chemical class of 4-oxoquinolizine as a potential oral treatment for Burkholderia pseudomallei. This work is being conducted under a contract with DTRA that was awarded in 2014 and runs through the end of March 2018. GC-072 has demonstrated protection in vivo from lethal, aerosol B. pseudomallei infection when administered orally, and it shows activity not only on drug-sensitive strains, but also on clinical isolates resistant to marketed antibiotics (including quinolones).
 
EBI-001. We are developing EBI-001, a next generation pan-respiratory antiviral as part of our iminosugar-based discovery program. Iminosugars are any analog of a sugar where a nitrogen atom has replaced one of the carbon or oxygen atoms and a class of compounds that includes licensed products for treatment of other non-viral diseases. Advantages of this class of host-based therapeutics include activity against a variety of viruses and limited risk for development of drug-induced viral resistance.
 
Antibody Therapeutics
 
Our Antibody Therapeutics business unit contains a broad portfolio of specialty antibody-based therapeutics and prophylactics that address a broad range of existing and emerging PHTs.
 
Products
 
Raxibacumab. Raxibacumab is the first fully-human monoclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax due to bacillus anthracis. It was licensed by the FDA in December 2012 and has orphan drug designation in the United States, giving it market exclusivity in the United States until December 2019. Raxibacumab is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate. Raxibacumab has been supplied to the SNS since 2009 under contracts with BARDA. Upon the closing of our acquisition of Raxibacumab from GSK, we assumed responsibility for a multi-year contract with BARDA, valued at up to approximately $130 million at acquisition to supply the product to the SNS through November 2019. We intend to pursue negotiation of a follow-on contract with the U.S. government to ensure the uninterrupted supply of this MCM to the SNS. Under the terms of our acquisition agreements, we will purchase product from GSK to enable completion of deliveries to the SNS under the existing BARDA procurement contract. We have initiated the process of the transfer of Raxibacumab manufacturing from GSK to our Bayview facility.
 
Anthrasil® [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. Anthrasil is comprised of purified human polyclonal immune globulin G, or IgG, containing polyclonal antibodies directed to the anthrax toxins of Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax disease, and is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with our BioThrax vaccine. Anthrasil was licensed by the FDA in March 2015 for the treatment of suspected or documented inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Simultaneous with FDA approval in 2015, Anthrasil also received orphan drug designation, resulting in market exclusivity in the United States until March 2022. To date, the principal customer for Anthrasil has been the U.S. government, specifically HHS. Anthrasil is procured by BARDA for delivery into the SNS. We have two current contracts with BARDA: a development and procurement contract with BARDA that expires in April 2021 and a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with BARDA for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, as well as the manufacture of such plasma into bulk drug substance and finished drug product and delivery of finished product into the SNS over a five-year period through September 2018. BARDA issued one task order under this second contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, which was completed in 2015. In addition to domestic government sales, Anthrasil has been sold to several foreign governments. In December 2017, we were awarded a contract by the Canadian Department of National Defence valued at approximately $8 million to deliver Anthrasil to the Canadian government. This contract award follows the December 2017 approval of Anthrasil by Health Canada under the Extraordinary Use New Drug, or EUND Regulations, which provide a regulatory pathway in Canada for products for which collecting clinical information for its intended use in humans is logistically or ethically not possible.
 
BAT® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)-(Equine)]. BAT is the only heptavalent antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulism. BAT is comprised of purified polyclonal equine immune globulins (antibodies) directed to the seven toxins (A through G) produced by Clostridium botulinum. BAT was licensed by the FDA in the United States in March 2013 for the treatment of suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin A, B, C, D, E, F or G. It was also licensed in Canada in December of 2016 pursuant to Health Canada's EUND regulations. Simultaneous with FDA licensure in 2013, BAT also received orphan drug designation, resulting in market exclusivity in the United States until March 2020. BAT is the only heptavalent botulism antitoxin available in the United States or Canada for treating naturally occurring botulism in adults or pediatric patients. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness. Naturally occurring cases are mainly seen in infants or in adults who have consumed improperly processed foods. Botulinum toxin can also be used as a bioterrorism agent and has been identified in the United States as one of the highest priority bioterrorism threats. To date, the principal customer for BAT has been the U.S. government, specifically HHS. We are currently operating under a procurement contract with BARDA in support of the program including stability testing, post marketing commitments, and manufacturing.  We signed a modification to our contract with BARDA to manufacture and store bulk drug substance for BAT in March 2017, valued at approximately $53 million with a five-year period of performance. This modification to the contract is intended to enable future filling and deliveries of final drug product to the SNS. In addition to domestic government sales, BAT has been sold to foreign governments. For example, we have a 10-year contract, executed in 2012, to supply BAT to the Canadian Department of National Defense as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada and individual provincial health authorities.
 
VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. VIGIV is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA to address certain complications from smallpox vaccination. VIGIV is comprised of purified polyclonal human immune globulins (antibodies) directed to the vaccinia virus, the virus that is used in 
replicating virus vaccinations, such as
 ACAM2000, a product that is currently being procured and delivered into the SNS. VIGIV is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with our ACAM2000 vaccine or previously immunized with the DryVax vaccine. Vaccinia is not the virus that causes smallpox, but it is similar enough to elicit a protective immune response when used as a smallpox vaccine. Individuals who are susceptible to vaccinia may develop an infection from ACAM2000 or other similar replicating virus vaccines, and these patients may benefit from treatment with VIGIV. VIGIV was licensed by the FDA in May 2005 and by Health Canada in May 2007 for counteracting certain complications that can be associated with smallpox vaccination. Although VIGIV has been sold to foreign governments, to date, the principal customer for VIGIV has been the U.S. government, specifically HHS. We anticipate negotiating a follow-on contract for the continued supply of VIGIV into the SNS.

Research and Development
 
We are engaged in research and development and have incurred substantial expenses for these activities. These expenses generally include the cost of acquiring or inventing new technologies and products, as well as development work on new product candidates (or label expansions of existing products). To offset these expenditures, we actively seek, and historically have been successful in obtaining, contract and grant awards for development funding from U.S. government agencies within both HHS and DoD. Gross research and development expenses and net research and development expense (income) are as follows:

 | December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------+--------------+------
in millions | 2017 | | | 2016 | | | 2015
Research and development expense | $ | 97.4 | | | $ | 108.3 | | $ | 119.2 |

Net research and development expense (revenue) | $ | 27.0 | | | $ | (35.1 | ) | $ | 1.8 | 

Marketing and Sales
 
For our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives, Antibody Therapeutics and Devices business units, we sell our products primarily to the U.S. government and domestic non-government organizations. All three business units share a team of dedicated marketing and sales personnel. We intend to use a similar approach to the marketing and sales of other product candidates that we either successfully develop or acquire. In addition to domestic sales, we sell our products to allied foreign governments as well as non-governmental organizations in foreign jurisdictions. For our non-U.S. sales, we use a combination of our employees as well as third-party marketing distributors and representatives to sell our products in key international markets, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Rim. We anticipate engaging additional representatives as interest in countermeasures addressing PHTs increases outside the United States.
 
Our Contract Development and Manufacturing business unit is supported by a dedicated group of business development professionals qualified to represent the full spectrum of contract product development and manufacturing services that we offer.

 
Competition
 
Our products and product candidates intended for the treatment or prevention of CBRNE and EID threats face significant competition. Our products and any product or product candidate that we acquire or successfully develop and commercialize are likely to compete with current products and product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:

MANUFACTURING
 
Our Lansing, Michigan site is a vertically integrated manufacturing facility and the location of our BioThrax manufacturing and NuThrax development operations. Located within the Lansing site is Building 55, our large-scale manufacturing facility, which was licensed by the FDA in August 2016 for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train and has the capacity to add additional manufacturing trains, if needed. The manufacturing capabilities of Building 55 are central to our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives business unit. Our Lansing site also comprises biologics bulk product manufacturing capability (large- and small-scale), which we market to CDMO customers.
 
Our manufacturing facilities located at our Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, site are actively engaged in plasma-derived hyperimmune therapeutics manufacturing, chromatography-based plasma fractionation, downstream processing, aseptic filling, packaging and warehousing, quality assurance and control, and include development laboratories and office space. At these facilities, we manufacture and fill our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, including Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, and we conduct bulk manufacture of RSDL lotion. Also at these facilities, we manufacture other hyperimmune products for contract manufacturing customers. The facilities at this site will play a key role in executing both product development and manufacturing activities in support of our Antibody Therapeutics and Contract Development and Manufacturing business units.
 
Our primary contract fill/finish services manufacturing site is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our "Camden Site." The Camden Site provides pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validations, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies support. This facility is an approved manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East as well as various other countries. The facility includes warehousing space used for cold-storage and freezer capacity to support contract manufacturing customers. Additionally, we intend for this facility to provide fill/finish services to many of our business units for our development and commercial-stage products and product candidates.
 
Our manufacturing facility focused on disposable manufacturing for viral and non-viral products is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our "Bayview Site." This facility is designed to take advantage of single-use bioreactor technology and to be capable of manufacturing several different products, including products derived from cell culture or microbial systems. In June 2012, we entered into a contract with BARDA, which established our Bayview Site as a CIADM. In May 2017 we completed work to expand this facility to double its original size to meet the needs of our customers. The new suite within the expanded facility is expected to come online with cGMP production capabilities in late 2018. The facility is one of three centers designated by HHS to provide advanced development and manufacturing of MCMs to support the U.S. government's national security and public health emergency needs. This facility has also been and will continue to be marketed to non-U.S. government clients in need of bulk manufacturing services. We are currently in the process of pursuing FDA licensure for the transfer of manufacturing of Raxibacumab to our Bayview facility.
 
We also currently lease a packaging facility in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, at the University of Southern Mississippi's Accelerator, a technology innovation and commercialization center. This facility is equipped to package RSDL. RSDL bulk lotion that is manufactured in Winnipeg is shipped to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, for combination with RSDL sponges, which are further manufactured, packaged and then released for sale. All RSDL packets are packaged at this facility.
 
In October 2017, in connection with our acquisition of the ACAM2000 business from Sanofi, we acquired a live viral manufacturing facility and a leased office and warehouse space, both in Canton, Massachusetts, and a 
leased cGMP live viral fill/finish facility in Rockville, Maryland. Our Rockville facility is an FDA-licensed manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes of the United States, Australia and Singapore. In November 2017, we received FDA approval of our supplemental BLA for the transfer of the upstream portion of the manufacturing process of ACAM2000 to our live viral manufacturing facility in Canton, Massachusetts.
 
Supplies and Raw Materials
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to manufacture some of the supplies we require for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as supplies and raw materials used in the production of our products. Typically, we acquire these supplies and raw materials on a purchase order basis and, when possible, in quantities we believe adequate to meet our needs. We obtain Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, used to manufacture BioThrax and NuThrax, from a single-source supplier for which we have no alternative source of supply. However, we maintain stored supplies of this adjuvant sufficient to meet our expected manufacturing needs for these products. We also utilize single-source suppliers for other raw materials in our manufacturing process.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property that arises from our activities. It is our policy to respect the intellectual property rights of others. In general, and where practicable, we pursue patent protection for new and innovative processes and products that we develop. The term of protection for various patents associated with and expected to be associated with our products and product candidates extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect the intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. We take a number of measures to protect our trade secrets and confidential information, including entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. In general, and where practicable, we also pursue registered trademarks for our products and product candidates. We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. We enter into these agreements to augment our own intellectual property and to secure freedom to operate where necessary. These agreements impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of agreements in the future.
REGULATION
 
Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
 
Government Contracting
 
Our status as a U.S. government contractor means that we are subject to various statutes and regulations, including:
 
 
§ | the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, or DFARs, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of DoD government contracts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the Department of State Acquisition Regulation, or DOSAR, which regulates the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



U.S. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. These regulations can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various regulations, our government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience, detailed auditing and accounting systems requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes.
 
Project BioShield. The Project BioShield Act of 2004, or Project BioShield, provides expedited procedures for bioterrorism-related procurement and the awarding of research grants, making it easier for HHS to rapidly commit funds to countermeasure projects. Project BioShield relaxes procedures under the FAR for procuring property or services used in performing, administering or supporting biomedical countermeasure research and development. In addition, if the Secretary of HHS deems that there is a pressing need, Project BioShield authorizes the Secretary to use an expedited award process, rather than the normal peer review process, for grants, contracts and cooperative agreements related to biomedical countermeasure research and development activity. Under Project BioShield, in limited specified circumstances, HHS can contract to purchase unapproved countermeasures for the SNS and authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA.
 
First Responders Act. The First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act of 2016 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS, to establish a pilot program to provide short-dated vaccines from the SNS to emergency response providers on a voluntary basis.
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, was signed into law in December 2005. The PREP Act creates liability protection for manufacturers of biodefense countermeasures when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. A PREP Act declaration is intended to provide liability protection from claims under federal or state law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure under a government contract. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations identifying BioThrax, ACAM2000, Raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, as covered countermeasures. These declarations expire in 2022. Manufacturers are not entitled to protection under the PREP Act in cases of willful misconduct and, accordingly, the PREP Act may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002. The Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective TechnologyAct of 2002, or SAFETY Act, is intended to create product liability limitations for qualifying anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising from or related to an act of terrorism. Certain of our products, namely BioThrax and RSDL, are certified anti-terrorism products covered under the protections of the SAFETY Act. Although we are covered by the benefits of the SAFETY Act for BioThrax and RSDL, the SAFETY Act may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
Product Development for Therapeutics and Vaccines
 
Pre-Clinical Testing. Before beginning testing of compounds in human subjects in the United States, stringent government requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing generally includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. We generally perform pre-clinical safety and efficacy testing on our product candidates before we initiate clinical trials.
Animal Rule. For product candidates that are intended to treat or prevent infection from rare life-threatening diseases, conducting controlled clinical trials with human patients to determine efficacy may be unethical or unfeasible. Under regulations issued by the FDA in 2002, often referred to as the "Animal Rule," under some circumstances, approval of such product candidates can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy subjects that demonstrate adequate safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from adequate and well-controlled animal studies. Among other requirements, the animal studies must establish that the drug or biological product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans. Because the FDA must agree that data derived from animal studies may be extrapolated to establish safety and efficacy in humans, these studies add complexity and uncertainty to the testing and approval process. In addition, products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements, including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.
 
Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug, or IND, application. The sponsor must also include an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation. The pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day period.
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials generally involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. In certain cases, described below, animal studies may be used in place of human studies. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
 
§ | Phase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 2 clinical trials involve a small number of patients with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 3 clinical trials consist of expanded, larger-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product candidate using a specific dosing regimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA approval of the product candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 4 clinical trials are sometimes conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, including to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific patient population. As part of a product approval, the FDA may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are sometimes called post-marketing commitment studies, be conducted post-approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Clinical Practice. All phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA's bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected.
Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines
 
Biologics License Application/New Drug Application. For large molecule products, including products such as vaccines, products derived from blood and blood components, and antibodies and other recombinant proteins, all data obtained from a development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a biologics licensing application, or BLA, to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. For small molecule drugs, this information is submitted in a filing called a New Drug Application, or NDA. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. Once an application is accepted for filing, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, requires the FDA to review the application within 10 months of its 60-day filing date, although in practice, longer review times may occur.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, BLAs, NDAs and certain supplements must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted.
 
In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant approval, request more information or data, or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which approval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug's risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug. The FDA may also significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a product.
 
Fast Track Designation. The FDA may designate a product as a fast track drug if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this disease or condition. Sponsors granted a fast track designation for a drug are granted more opportunities to interact with the FDA during the approval process and are eligible for FDA review of the application on a rolling basis, before the application has been completed. The FDA granted fast track status to NuThrax in June 2011 and to ZIKV-IG in December 2017.
Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an ''orphan drug'' in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. A manufacturer must request orphan drug designation prior to submitting a BLA or NDA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, reduced filing fees for marketing applications and a special seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public's need. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved.
 
Our products with current orphan drug exclusivity in the United States include the following:
 
 
§ | BioThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed B. anthracis exposure, when administered in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs, with exclusivity though November 2022;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Raxibacumab for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate, with exclusivity through December 2019;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Anthrasil for the treatment of toxemia associated with inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, with exclusivity through March 2022; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | BAT for the treatment of suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin A, B, C, D, E, F or G, with exclusivity through March 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug, biologic or medical device product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, cGMPs and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product's distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA has post-approval authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if warranted by the appearance of new safety information. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their facility with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-label promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our products. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and promotion exist for products that have so-called "black box warnings" in their approved package inserts, such as Anthrasil and VIGIV in the United States.
 
Vaccine and Therapeutic Product Lot Release and FDA Review. Because the manufacturing process for biological products is complex, the FDA requires for many biologics, including most vaccines and immune globulin products, that each product lot undergo thorough testing for purity, potency, identity and sterility. All of our vaccines and immune globulin products are subject to lot release protocols by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.  The length of the FDA review process depends on a number of factors, including reviewer questions, license supplement approval, reviewer availability and whether our internal testing of product samples is completed before or concurrently with FDA testing.  The length of the review process depends on a number of factors, including reviewer questions, license supplement approval, reviewer availability and whether our internal testing of product samples is completed before or concurrently with regulatory agency testing, if applicable.
 Priority Review Vouchers. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act added Section 524 to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and established the Neglected Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher, or PRV, program. This PRV program was expanded in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act to include rare pediatric diseases. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established a PRV program within the FDA for MCMs for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats, and those vaccines, therapeutics and MCMs, that prevent or treat material threat agents as identified in the Public Health Service Act. Under the PRV program, companies receive a special voucher which allows them to have a drug reviewed under FDA's priority review system, with the anticipation that it will accelerate the regulatory review to get the product to market more rapidly. Recipients of a PRV may transfer that voucher to another party for consideration.
 
Several of our investigational stage product candidates may be eligible for PRV under multiple PRV programs upon the product approval. We believe that ZIKV-IG (NP024), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed as a prophylaxis and treatment for Zika infections in at risk populations; and VLA1601, a vaccine being developed against Zika infection, may each have the potential for a PRV under the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program. We believe that GC-072, the lead compound in the EV-035 series of broad-spectrum antibiotics being developed as an oral and intravenous treatment for Burkholderia pseudomallei infection; UNI-FLU, a universal influenza vaccine candidate for prevention of pandemic influenza infections; EBX-205, an oral therapeutic to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection caused by biothreat pathogens, such as B. anthrasis, F. tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei; and EBI-001, a pan-respiratory iminosugar antiviral intended for treatment of pandemic influenza, may each have the potential for a PRV under the MCM PRV program. We believe that FILOV (NP026), an equine polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed to treat hemorrhagic fever caused by Filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg and Sudan), may have potential for a PRV under either the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program or the MCM PRV program.
 
Marketing Approval – Devices
 
Devices may fall within the definition of a Medical Device or 
may be a Combination Product including both a device for delivery of 
a drug product and the drug product itself. Medical Devices are also subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive regulation under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. The RSDL Kit is regulated as a non-restricted Class II medical device. Our Trobigard auto-injector product is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA or any similar regulatory body and is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the United States. This product is not distributed in the United States.

§ | Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls. These general controls include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth requirements for manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse medical events, labeling and promotion only for cleared or approved intended uses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Class II devices are also subject to these general controls and to any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device approved by the FDA after May 28, 1976. This previously-cleared device is called the predicate device. If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. If a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that was cleared prior to May 28, 1976, the proposed device is cleared based on a pre-amendment and is cleared as an unclassified device.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | A Class III device requires approval of a pre-market application, or PMA, which is an expensive, lengthy and uncertain process requiring many years to complete. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE. An IDE must be supported by pre-clinical data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reports of adverse events, labeling and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use. If the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions, including:
 
§  fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
 §  recall or seizure of products;
 §  operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 §  refusal of requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
 §  withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and
 §  criminal prosecution.
 
The FDA also has the authority to require repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device. The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA approval are subject to FDA export requirements.
 
Combination Products, of the type described above, are subject to the BLA/NDA regulatory regime. Our Trobigard auto-injector is a combination product and is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA or any similar regulatory body and is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the United States. This product is not distributed in the United States.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States and Canada as well as select foreign countries. We intend to further expand our commercial presence to additional foreign countries and territories. In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a process similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the EU Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). Additionally, each foreign country subjects medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union, a harmonized medical device directive legislates approval requirements. Within this framework, the CE Mark, an attestation of conformity with the essential health, safety and environmental requirements and compliance with relevant European Union legislation, allows for the legal marketing of the product in all European Economic Area member states. Additionally, to the extent that a product is marketed outside of the United States, a facility may also be registered with applicable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities, who may also require inspections for compliance with local marketing regulations.
 
Anti-Corruption Laws
 
As part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs are required to publicly report payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. This information is posted on a public website. Failure to timely and accurately submit required information could subject us to civil penalties.
 
Our operations are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by the activities of our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector, Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries.
 
Other Industry Regulation
 
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the use of data, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of February 16, 2018, we had 1,256 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
 
We maintain a website at www.emergentbiosolutions.com. We make available, free of charge on our website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file those reports with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.

We have included our website address as an inactive textual reference only. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
ITEM 
1A. RISK FACTORS
 
You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. If any of the risks described below or in subsequent reports we file with the SEC actually occur, they may materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we presently consider to be immaterial may also materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. The discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations."
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS
 
We currently derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of BioThrax to our principal customer, the U.S. government. If the U.S. government's demand for and/or funding for procurement of BioThrax is substantially reduced, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow would be materially harmed.
 
We have derived, and expect for the foreseeable future to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of BioThrax, our anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA to the U.S. government. In December 2016, we signed a follow-on procurement contract with the CDC for the delivery of approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax for placement into the SNS over a five-year period ending in September 2021. The potential value of this contract is approximately $911 million if all procurement options are exercised.
 
The procurement of doses of BioThrax by the CDC is subject to the availability of funding. We have no certainty that funding will be made available for the procurement of doses under the CDC contract. If the SNS priorities change, funding to procure doses of BioThrax may be limited or not available, and our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially harmed. The success of our business and our operating results for the foreseeable future are significantly dependent on funding for the procurement of BioThrax and the terms of our BioThrax sales to the U.S. government, including the price per dose, the number of doses and the timing of deliveries.
 
Our submission of NuThrax for EUA pre-approval and eventual FDA licensure may not be approved by the FDA in a timely manner or at all. Delays in our ability to achieve such pre-approval and licensure could prevent us from realizing the full potential value of our BARDA contract for the advanced development and delivery of NuThrax.
 
In September 2016, we entered into a contract with HHS through BARDA for the advanced development and delivery of NuThrax, our next generation anthrax vaccine candidate. The contract, as modified in March 2017, is valued at up to approximately $1.5 billion.
 
We intend to submit an application with the FDA for EUA pre-approval of NuThrax this year, and although there can be no assurances, we currently anticipate that the FDA could authorize NuThrax for emergency use as early as 2019, triggering deliveries of NuThrax to the SNS for use in an emergency situation as early as 2019. However, the FDA does not have review deadlines with respect to such submissions and, therefore, the timing of any approval of an EUA pre-approval submission is uncertain. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will review our data in a timely manner, or that the FDA will accept the data when reviewed. The FDA may decide that our data are insufficient for EUA pre-approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies and refuse to approve our application. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining EUA pre-approval for NuThrax and eventual FDA licensure in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to realize the full potential value of the contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
 
In addition, if priorities for the SNS change, funding to procure any future doses of NuThrax may be limited or not available, and our future business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.
 
Our U.S. government procurement and development contracts require ongoing funding decisions by the U.S. government. Reduced or discontinued funding of these contracts could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to suffer materially.
 
The U.S. government is the principal customer for our PHT-focused MCMs and is the primary source of funds for the development of our product candidates in our development pipeline, most notably our NuThrax product candidate. We anticipate that the U.S. government will also be a principal customer for those MCMs that we successfully develop within our existing product development pipeline, as well as those we acquire in the future. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue comes from U.S. government development contracts and grants. Over its lifetime, a U.S. government procurement or development program may be implemented through the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding for such government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations, generally made on a fiscal year basis, even for programs designed to continue for several years. For example, sales of BioThrax to be supplied under our procurement contract with the CDC are subject to the availability of funding, mostly from annual appropriations. These appropriations can be subject to political considerations and stringent budgetary constraints.
 
Additionally, our government-funded development contracts typically give the U.S. government the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to extend these contracts for successive option periods following a base period of performance. The value of the services to be performed during these option periods may constitute the majority of the total value of the underlying contract. For example, the September 2016 contract award from BARDA for the development and delivery to the SNS of NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease consists of a five-year base period of performance valued at approximately $200 million. The contract award also includes options for the delivery of additional doses of NuThrax to the SNS and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments which if both were to be exercised in full, would increase the total contract value to up to $1.5 billion. If levels of government expenditures and authorizations for public health countermeasure preparedness decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do not offer products or are not developing product candidates, or if the U.S. government otherwise declines to exercise its options under our existing contracts, our business, revenues, operating results and cash flows would suffer.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure follow-on procurement contracts with the U.S. government upon the expiration of any of our current product procurement contracts.
 
Our revenue is substantially dependent upon product procurement contracts with the U.S. government and foreign governments for our PHT products. Upon the expiration of a procurement contract, we may not be able to negotiate a follow-on procurement contract for the particular product for a similar product volume, period of performance, pricing or other terms, or at all. The inability to secure a similar or increased procurement contract could materially affect our business, revenues, operating results and cash flows. For example, the CDC procurement contract for ACAM2000 that we recently acquired in our acquisition of the ACAM2000 business from Sanofi will be up for renewal or extension in March 2018. The BARDA procurement contract for Raxibacumab that we recently assumed responsibility for in our acquisition of Raxibacumab from GSK expires in 2019. Our CDC procurement contract for BioThrax expires in 2021. We intend to negotiate follow-on procurement contracts for each of our PHT products upon the expiration of a related procurement contract, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Even if we are successful in negotiating a follow-on procurement contract, it may be for a lower product volume, over a shorter period of performance or be on less favorable pricing or other terms. An inability to secure follow-on procurement contracts for our products could materially and adversely affect our revenues, operating results, cash flows and business prospects.
 
The government contracting process is typically a competitive bidding process and involves unique risks and requirements.
 
Our business involves government contracts and grants, which may be awarded through competitive bidding. Competitive bidding for government contracts presents a number of risks and requirements, including:
 
 
§ | the possibility that we may be ineligible to respond to a request for proposal issued by the government;

§ | the commitment of substantial time and attention of management and key employees to the preparation of bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any contract that we might be awarded;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the submission by third parties of protests to our responses to requests for proposal that could result in delays or withdrawals of those requests for proposal; and

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The U.S. government may choose not to award us future contracts for either the development of our new product candidates or for the procurement of our existing products addressing PHTs, and may instead award such contracts to our competitors. If we are unable to secure particular contracts, we may not be able to operate in the market for products that are provided under those contracts. Additionally, if we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over an extended period, or if we fail to anticipate all of the costs or resources that we will be required to secure and, if applicable, perform under such contract awards, our growth strategy and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Laws and regulations affecting government contracts make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and materially damage our reputation and relationship with the U.S. government, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
As a manufacturer and supplier of MCMs to the U.S. government addressing PHTs, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations govern how we transact business with our government clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs and related obligations on our business operations.  Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:
 
 
§ | the FAR and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the DFARs and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of the DoD government contracts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the DOSAR, which regulates the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to International Traffic in Arms Regulations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



U.S. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. Even though we take significant precautions to identify, prevent and deter fraud, misconduct and non-compliance, we face the risk that our personnel or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud or improper activities. If we are audited and such audit were to uncover improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from government contracting, and suffer significant reputational harm. Loss of our status as an eligible government contractor would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The amount we are paid under our fixed price government procurement contracts is based on estimates we have made of the time, resources and expenses required for us to perform under those contracts. If our actual costs exceed our estimates, we may not be able to earn an adequate return or may incur a loss under these contracts, which could harm our operating results and materially reduce our net income.
 
Our current procurement contracts with HHS and the DoD are fixed price contracts. We expect that future procurement contracts we successfully secure with the U.S. government would also be fixed price contracts. Under a fixed price contract, we are required to deliver our products at a fixed price regardless of the actual costs we incur. Estimating costs that are related to performance in accordance with contract specifications is difficult, particularly where the period of performance is over several years. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract could reduce the profitability of such a contract or cause a loss, which could harm our operating results and materially reduce our net income.
 
Unfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which may be customary, may subject our business to material limitations, restrictions and uncertainties and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
Government contracts customarily contain provisions that give the U.S. government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the U.S. government to:
 
 
§ | terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | unilaterally reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts, including by imposing equitable price adjustments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | cancel multi-year contracts and related orders, if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | decline, in whole or in part, to exercise an option to purchase product under a procurement contract or to fund additional development under a development contract;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | decline to renew a procurement contract;
--+-----------------------------------------


§ | claim rights to facilities or to products, including intellectual property, developed under the contract;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | require repayment of contract funds spent on construction of facilities in the event of contract default;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | take actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | direct the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | suspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | pursue civil or criminal remedies under acts such as the False Claims Act and False Statements Act; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | control or prohibit the export of products.
--+--------------------------------------------



Generally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the U.S. government's convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the U.S. government terminates a contract for convenience, the government contractor may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the U.S. government terminates a contract for default, the government contractor is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. All of our contracts, both development and procurement, with the U.S. government, are terminable at the U.S. government's convenience with these potential consequences.
 
In addition, our U.S. government contracts grant the U.S. government the right to use technologies developed by us under the government contract or the right to share data related to our technologies, for or on behalf of the U.S. government. Under our U.S. government contracts, we might not be able to prohibit third parties, including our competitors, from accessing such technology or data, including intellectual property, in providing products and services to the U.S. government.
 
REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
 
Our long-term success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates we develop or acquire and, if we are not successful, our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.
 
Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development, including testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, storage and approval, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Except under limited circumstances related to certain government sales, failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate.
 
In the United States, to obtain approval from the FDA to market any of our future biologic products, we will be required to submit a BLA to the FDA. Ordinarily, the FDA requires a company to support a BLA with substantial evidence of the product candidate's safety and efficacy in treating the targeted indication based on data derived from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, including Phase III safety and efficacy trials conducted in patients with the disease or condition being targeted.
 
However, NuThrax and many of our MCM product candidates, for example, are subject to a different regulatory approval pathway under the FDA's "Animal Rule". The Animal Rule provides a regulatory pathway for drug and biologic products targeting indications for which human efficacy studies are not feasible or would be unethical. Instead, efficacy must be demonstrated, in part, by utilizing animal models rather than testing in humans. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will permit us to proceed with licensure of NuThrax or any of our PHT MCM candidates under the Animal Rule. Even if we are able to proceed pursuant to the Animal Rule, the FDA may decide that our data are insufficient to support approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies, refuse to approve our products, or place restrictions on our ability to commercialize those products. Furthermore, products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to certain additional post-marketing requirements. For example, to the extent feasible and ethical, manufacturers of products approved pursuant to the Animal Rule must conduct post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the product candidate's clinical benefit and to assess its safety when used as indicated. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet this regulatory requirement even if one or more of our product candidates are approved under the Animal Rule.
 
The process of obtaining these regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in the regulatory approval process during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in the regulatory review process may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.
 
The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient to support approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate.
 
We intend to transfer the manufacturing of Raxibacumab, which we recently acquired from GSK, to our facilities in Baltimore, Maryland, and this transfer of manufacturing operations requires FDA approval.
 
Under our arrangements with GSK for our acquisition of the Raxibacumab product, we will continue to purchase product from GSK to satisfy deliveries to the SNS under the current BARDA contract, which expires in 2019. We intend to seek FDA approval to transfer the manufacturing of Raxibacumab to our Baltimore, Maryland manufacturing facilities and currently anticipate FDA approval of this technology transfer in 2020. Approval of this technology transfer may involve complications or may not be secured on a timely basis or at all. Any delay in the approval of this anticipated technology transfer would delay our expected benefits and synergies from this product acquisition and could materially harm our business, revenues, operating results and cash flows. Until approval of this technology transfer, we must rely on GSK to supply product to us to satisfy deliveries to the SNS under the BARDA contract, and GSK may fail to meet delivery obligations, which could result in our inability to satisfy requirements under the BARDA contract.
 
Even after regulatory approval is received, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our approved products, they could be subject to restrictions, penalties or withdrawal from the market.
 
Any vaccine, therapeutic product or medical device for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Our approved products are subject to these requirements and ongoing review. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP, requirements relating to potency and stability, quality control, quality assurance, restrictions on advertising and promotion, import and export restrictions and recordkeeping requirements. In addition, various state laws require that companies that manufacture and/or distribute drug products within the state obtain and maintain a manufacturer or distributor license, as appropriate. Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
 
Our regulators enforce cGMP and other requirements through periodic unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA is authorized to inspect domestic manufacturing facilities without prior notice at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner. Health Canada may conduct similar inspections of our facilities where Canadian marketed products are produced, or related formulation and filling operations are conducted. The FDA, Health Canada, and other foreign regulatory agencies conduct periodic inspections of our facilities. For example, our Lansing Building 55 facility was inspected most recently by the FDA in June 2016, our Lansing Building 12 facility was inspected most recently by the FDA in April 2016, our Winnipeg manufacturing facility was inspected most recently by the FDA in May 2017 and Health Canada in November 2016, our Canton, Massachusetts manufacturing facility was inspected most recently by the FDA in December 2017, our Rockville facility was inspected most recently by the FDA in March 2017, and our Baltimore (Camden) facility was most recently inspected by the Health Products Regulatory Authority of Ireland in February 2017, FDA in January 2017 and Health Canada in October 2016. Following several of these inspections, regulatory authorities issued inspectional observations, some of which were significant, but all of which are being, or have been, addressed through corrective actions. If, in connection with any future inspection, regulatory authorities find that we are not in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements, or if they are not satisfied with the corrective actions we take, our regulators may undertake enforcement action against us, which may include:
 
 
§ | warning letters and other communications;
--+------------------------------------------


§ | product seizure or withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


§ | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


§ | suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | fines or disgorgement of profits or revenue; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


§ | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------



Similar action may be taken against us should we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or later discover previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes. For instance, our products are tested regularly to determine if they satisfy potency and stability requirements for their required shelf lives. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. If we experience any of these post-approval events, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Additionally, companies may not promote drugs for "off-label" uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies). A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies (such as entering into corporate integrity agreements with the U.S. government), as well as criminal sanctions. If our employees or agents engage in "off-label" marketing of any of our products, we could be subject to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct business in certain markets, negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, and damage our reputation.
 
Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products abroad and could limit the growth of our business.
 
We intend to sell certain of our products outside the United States. To market our products in the European Union and many other foreign jurisdictions, we may need to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by foreign regulatory authorities. The approval procedures in foreign jurisdictions can vary widely and can involve additional clinical trials and data review beyond that required by the FDA. We and our collaborators may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and therefore we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products internationally. We have limited experience in preparing, filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to gain foreign regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations and consultants to assist us in this process.
 
Our international operations increase our risk of exposure to potential claims of bribery and corruption.
 
As we expand our commercialization activities outside of the United States, we are subject to an increased risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the FCPA the U.K. Bribery Act, Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, or other similar foreign laws, which prohibit corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operations and seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships with various third parties and will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities and physicians employed by state-run healthcare institutions who may be deemed to be foreign officials under the FCPA or similar foreign laws. If our business practices are found to be in violation of the FCPA or similar foreign laws despite our training and compliance efforts, we and our senior management may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, potential debarment from public procurement and reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 
MANUFACTURING RISKS
 
Disruption at, damage to or destruction of our manufacturing facilities could impede our ability to manufacture BioThrax or our other products, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
An interruption in our manufacturing operations in Lansing, Michigan, could result in our inability to produce BioThrax for delivery to satisfy the product demands of our customers in a timely manner, which would reduce our revenues and materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including:
 
 
§ | equipment malfunctions or failures;
--+------------------------------------


§ | technology malfunctions;
--+-------------------------


§ | cyber-attacks;
--+---------------


§ | work stoppages or slow-downs;
--+------------------------------


§ | protests, including by animal rights activists;
--+------------------------------------------------


§ | injunctions;
--+-------------


§ | damage to or destruction of the facility; and
--+----------------------------------------------


§ | product contamination or tampering.
--+------------------------------------



Providers of PHT countermeasures could be subject to an increased risk of terrorist activities. The U.S. government has designated both our Lansing, Michigan and our Bayview bulk manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland as facilities requiring additional security. Although we continually evaluate and update security measures, there can be no assurance that any additional security measures would protect our facilities from terrorist efforts determined to disrupt our manufacturing activities.
 
The factors listed above could also cause disruptions at our other facilities, including our manufacturing facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; other Baltimore, Maryland facilities; and Canton, Massachusetts; Rockville, Maryland; and Hattiesburg, Mississippi facilities. Any such disruption, damage, or destruction of these facilities could impede our ability to manufacture our products, our product candidates and our ability to produce products for external customers, result in losses and delays, including delay in the performance of our contractual obligations or delay in our clinical trials, any of which could be costly to us and materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
We may not be able to utilize the full manufacturing capacity of our manufacturing facilities, which could impact our future revenues and materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
 
Despite our ongoing efforts to optimize the utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure (including bulk, fill/finish, support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging), we may not be able to realize full utilization, which could adversely affect our future revenues, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
 
Our marketed products and our product candidates are complex to manufacture and ship, which could cause us to experience delays in product manufacturing or development and cause delays in revenues.
 
BioThrax, Raxibacumab, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT, VIGIV, and many of our current product candidates, including NuThrax, are biologics. Manufacturing biologic products, especially in large quantities, is complex. The products must be made consistently and in compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process. Problems during manufacturing may arise for a variety of reasons, including problems with raw materials, equipment malfunction and failure to follow specific protocols and procedures. In addition, slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including obtaining materials, maintaining master seed or cell banks and preventing genetic drift, seed or cell growth, fermentation, contamination including from particulates among other things, filtration, filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, potency and stability issues and other quality control testing, may result in lot failures or manufacturing shut-down, delays in the release of lots, product recalls, spoilage or regulatory action. Such deviations may require us to revise manufacturing processes or change manufacturers. Additionally, as our equipment ages, it will need to be replaced. Replacement of equipment has the potential to introduce variations in the manufacturing process that may result in lot failures or manufacturing shut-down, delay in the release of lots, product recalls, spoilage or regulatory action. Success rates can also vary dramatically at different stages of the manufacturing process, which can reduce yields and increase costs. From time to time, we may experience deviations in the manufacturing process that may take significant time and resources to resolve and, if unresolved, may affect manufacturing output and could cause us to fail to satisfy customer orders or contractual commitments, lead to a termination of one or more of our contracts, lead to delays in our clinical trials, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, including warning letters and other restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, or cause the FDA to cease releasing product until the deviations are explained and corrected, any of which could be costly to us, damage our reputation and negatively impact our business.
 
We are contractually required to ship our biologic products at a prescribed temperature range and variations from that temperature range could result in loss of product and could significantly and adversely impact our revenues.
 
Manufacturing delays, lot failures, shipping deviations, spoilage or other loss during shipping could cause us to fail to satisfy customer orders or contractual commitments, lead to a termination of one or more of our contracts, lead to delays in potential clinical trials or result in litigation or regulatory action against us, any of which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business.
 
We are required to obtain FDA approval prior to the release of each lot of BioThrax, which may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all.
 
FDA approval is required for the release of each lot of BioThrax. A "lot" is approximately 181,000 doses. We are not able to sell any lots that fail to satisfy the release testing specifications. For example, we must provide the FDA with the results of certain tests, including potency tests, before lots are released for sale. Potency testing of each lot of BioThrax is performed against a qualified control lot that we maintain. We have one mechanism for conducting this potency testing that is reliant on a unique animal strain for which we currently have no alternative. We continually monitor the status of our reference lot and periodically produce and qualify a new reference lot to replace the existing reference lot. If we are not able to produce and qualify a new reference lot or otherwise satisfy the FDA's requirements for release of BioThrax, our ability to sell BioThrax would be impaired until such time as we become able to meet the FDA's requirements, which would materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
 
If we are unable to obtain supplies for the manufacture of our products and product candidates in sufficient quantities, at an acceptable cost and in acceptable quality, our ability to manufacture or to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates could be impaired, which could materially harm our revenues, lead to a termination of one or more of our contracts, lead to delays in clinical trials or otherwise materially harm our business.
 
We depend on certain single-source suppliers for key materials and services necessary for the manufacture of BioThrax and our other products and product candidates. For example, we rely on a single-source supplier to provide us with Alhydrogel in sufficient quantities to meet our needs to manufacture BioThrax and NuThrax, and currently rely on a single-source supplier to manufacture Raxibacumab. We also rely on single-source suppliers for the sponge applicator device and the active ingredient used to make RSDL as well as the specialty plasma in our hyperimmune specialty plasma products and certain ingredients for ACAM2000. A disruption in the availability of such materials or services from these suppliers or in the quality of the material provided by such suppliers could require us to qualify and validate alternative suppliers. If we are unable to locate or establish alternative suppliers, our ability to manufacture our products and product candidates could be adversely affected and could harm our revenues, cause us to fail to satisfy contractual commitments, lead to a termination of one or more of our contracts or lead to delays in our clinical trials, any of which could be costly to us and otherwise materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
Our operations, including our use of hazardous materials, chemicals, bacteria and viruses, require us to comply with regulatory requirements and expose us to significant potential liabilities.
 
Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, bacteria and viruses, and may produce dangerous waste products. Accordingly, we, along with the third parties that conduct clinical trials and manufacture our products and product candidates on our behalf, are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern the use, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, exposure, disposal and recordkeeping with respect to these materials. Under the Federal Select Agent Program, pursuant to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, we are required to register with and be inspected by the CDC and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service if we have in our possession, or if we use or transfer, select biological agents or toxins that could pose a threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health or to animal or plant products. This legislation requires stringent safeguards and security measures for these select agents and toxins, including controlled access and the screening of entities and personnel and establishes a comprehensive national database of registered entities. We are also subject to a variety of environmental and occupational health and safety laws. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations can require significant costs and we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance. In addition, the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In such event, we could be held liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of hazardous materials. From time to time, we have been involved in remediation activities and may be so involved in the future. Any related cost or liability might not be fully covered by insurance, could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to complying with environmental and occupational health and safety laws, we must comply with special regulations relating to biosafety administered by the CDC, HHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the DoD, as well as regulatory authorities in Canada.
 
RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND COLLABORATIONS
 
Our strategy of generating growth through acquisitions may not be successful.
 
Our business strategy includes growing our business through acquisition and in-licensing transactions. We may not be successful in identifying, effectively evaluating, structuring, acquiring or in-licensing, and developing and commercializing additional products on favorable terms, or at all. Competition for attractive product opportunities is intense and may require us to devote substantial resources, both managerial and financial, to an acquisition opportunity. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to acquire or in-license products in the biopharmaceutical field. These companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, cost of capital, effective tax rate and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.
 
Acquisition efforts can consume significant management attention and require substantial expenditures, which could detract from our other programs. In addition, we may devote significant resources to potential acquisitions that are never completed. Even if we are successful in acquiring a company or product, it may not result in a successfully developed or commercialized product or, even if an acquired product is commercialized, competing products or technologies could render a product noncompetitive, uneconomical or obsolete. Moreover, the cost of acquiring other companies or in-licensing products could be substantial, and in order to acquire companies or new products, we may need to incur substantial debt or issue dilutive securities. For example, our recently completed acquisition of the ACAM2000 business required initial payments of $117.5 million and an additional milestone payment of $7.5 million on the achievement of a regulatory event. In addition, our recently completed acquisition of Raxibacumab required a $76 million upfront payment and may require up to $20 million in additional future milestone payments.
 
If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to acquire other companies or in-license and develop additional products, or if we acquire or in-license unproductive assets, it could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, and we could be compelled to record significant impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, which could materially harm our financial condition and operating results.
 
Our failure to successfully integrate acquired assets into our operations could adversely affect our ability to realize the benefits of such acquisitions and, therefore, to grow our business.
 
We may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably. In addition, cost synergies, if achieved at all, may be less than we expect, or may take greater time to achieve than we anticipate.
 
Issues that could delay or prevent successful integration or cost synergies of an acquired business or products include, among others:
 
 
§ | retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


§ | retaining key employees;
--+-------------------------


§ | diversion of management attention and resources;
--+-------------------------------------------------


§ | conforming internal controls, policies and procedures, business cultures and compensation programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


§ | successfully executing technology transfers and obtaining required regulatory approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | consolidating sales and marketing operations;
--+----------------------------------------------


§ | identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | assumption of known and unknown liabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------


§ | coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


§ | managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



If we are unable to successfully integrate pending and future acquisitions with our existing businesses, or operate any acquired business profitably, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially adversely affect the growth of our business and our financial condition and operating results.
 
COMPETITIVE AND POLITICAL RISKS
 
We face substantial competition, which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.
 
The development and commercialization of new biopharmaceutical and medical technology products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological advances. We may face future competition from other companies and governments, universities and other non-profit research organizations in respect to our products, any products that we acquire, our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less costly than any products that we may develop or market. Our competitors may have greater resources to devote to marketing or selling their products, adapt more quickly to new technologies, scientific advances or patient preferences and needs, initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can, or more effectively negotiate third-party licensing and collaborative arrangements.
 
There are a number of companies with products or product candidates addressing PHT preparedness that are competing with us for both U.S. government procurement and development resources. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  Our competitors may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our products or product candidates.
 
Any reduction in demand for our products or reduction or loss of development funding for our products or product candidates in favor of a competing product could lead to a loss of market share for our products and cause reduced revenues, margins and levels of profitability for us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
Our Biologic Products may face risks of competition from biosimilar manufacturers.
 
Competition for BioThrax, Raxibacumab, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, otherwise referred to as our "Biologic Products," may be affected by follow-on biologics, or "biosimilars," in the United States and other jurisdictions. Regulatory and legislative activity in the United States and other countries may make it easier for generic drug manufacturers to manufacture and sell biological drugs similar or identical to our Biologic Products, which might affect the profitability or commercial viability of our Biologic Products. Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2010, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until the 12-year exclusivity period for the innovator biologic has expired. Regulators in the European Union and in other foreign jurisdictions have already approved biosimilars. The specific regulatory framework for this biosimilar approval path and the extent to which an approved biosimilar would be substituted for the innovator biologic are not yet clear and will depend on many factors. If a biosimilar version of one of our Biologic Products were approved, it could have a material adverse effect on the sales and gross profits of the affected Biologic Product and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
Political or social factors may delay or impair our ability to market our products and may require us to spend significant management time and financial resources to address these issues.
 
Products developed to counter the potential impact of PHTs, whether CBRNE or EID, are subject to changing political and social environments. The political responses and social awareness of the risks of these threats on military personnel or civilians may vary over time. If the threat of terrorism were to decline, then the public perception of the risk on public health and safety may be reduced. This perception, as well as political or social pressures, could delay or cause resistance to bringing our products in development to market or limit pricing or purchases of our products, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and our financial condition and operating results.
 
In addition, substantial delays or cancellations of purchases could result from protests or challenges from third parties. Lawsuits brought against us by third parties or activists, even if not successful, could require us to spend significant management time and financial resources defending the related litigation and could potentially damage the public's perception of us and our products. Any publicity campaigns or other negative publicity may adversely affect the degree of market acceptance of our PHT countermeasures and thereby limit the demand for our products, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION RISKS
 
Our growth depends on our success in developing and commercializing our product candidates. If we are unable to commercialize these product candidates, or experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so, our business would be materially and adversely affected.
 
We have invested significant effort and financial resources in the development of our vaccines, therapeutics and medical device product candidates and the acquisition of additional product candidates. In addition to our product sales, our ability to generate revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including the success of our development programs, the U.S. government's interest in providing development funding for or procuring certain of our product candidates, and the commercial viability of our acquired or developed product candidates. The commercial success of our product candidates will depend on many factors, including accomplishing the following in an economical manner:
 
 
§ | successful development, formulation and cGMP scale-up of manufacturing that meets FDA or other foreign regulatory requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | successful program partnering;
--+-------------------------------


§ | successful completion of clinical or non-clinical development, including toxicology studies and studies in approved animal models;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | establishment of commercial manufacturing processes and product supply arrangements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | training of a commercial sales force for the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | successful registration and maintenance of relevant patent and/or other proprietary protection; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | acceptance of the product by potential government and other customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Under certain circumstances, we might sell unapproved MCMs to governmental entities.  While this is permissible in some cases, the extent to which we may be able to lawfully market and sell unapproved products in many jurisdictions may be unclear or ambiguous. Such sales could subject us to regulatory enforcement action, product liability and reputational risk.
 
Under certain circumstances, MCMs may be procured by government entities prior to approval by FDA or other regulatory authorities.  In the United States, the Project BioShield Act of 2004, or Project BioShield, permits the Secretary of HHS to contract to purchase MCMs for the SNS prior to FDA approval of the countermeasure in specified circumstances.  Project BioShield and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 also allow the FDA Commissioner to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA under an EUA pre-approval.  Absent an applicable exception, our MCM product candidates generally will have to be approved by FDA or other regulatory authorities through traditional pathways before we can sell those products to governments.  Additionally, the laws in certain jurisdictions regarding the ability of government entities to purchase unapproved product candidates are ambiguous, and the permissibility of exporting unapproved products from the United States and importing them to foreign countries may be unclear.  Nevertheless, governmental bodies, such as U.S. federal entities other than HHS, state and local governments within the United States, and foreign governments, may seek to procure our MCM product candidates that are not yet approved.  If so, we would expect to assess the permissibility and liability implications of marketing our product candidates to such entities on a case-by-case basis, which presents certain challenges, both in the case of U.S. and foreign governments, and particularly under emergency conditions.  In addition, agencies or branches of one country's government may take different positions regarding the permissibility of such sales than another country's government or even other agencies or branches of the same government. If we determine that we believe such activities are permissible, local enforcement authorities could disagree with our conclusion and take enforcement action against us. 
 
In addition, the sale of unapproved products also could give rise to product liability claims for which we may not be able to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage.  For example, liability protections applicable to claims arising under U.S. law and resulting from the use of certain unlicensed products, such as a declaration issued under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or the PREP Act, may not cover claims arising under non-U.S. law.
 
Regardless of the permissibility and liability risks, in the event a user of one or more of our products suffers an adverse event, we may be subject to additional reputational risk if the product has not been approved by the FDA or the corresponding regulatory authority of another country particularly because we will not have approved labeling regarding the safety or efficacy of those products. In addition, legislatures and other governmental bodies that have oversight responsibility for procuring agencies may raise concerns after the fact even if procurement was permissible at the time, which could result in negative publicity, reputational risk and harm to our business prospects.
 
Clinical trials of product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. We must invest substantial amounts of time and financial resources in these trials, which may not yield viable products. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates, particularly in the United States, could materially and adversely affect our financial resources, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Before obtaining regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidates, we and our collaborative partners, where applicable, must conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials to establish proof of concept and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials or animal efficacy studies will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial or animal efficacy study do not necessarily predict final results. An unexpected result in one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.
 
For certain of our product candidates addressing CBRNE threats, we expect to rely on the Animal Rule to obtain regulatory approval. The Animal Rule permits, in certain limited circumstances, the use of animal efficacy studies, together with human clinical safety and immunogenicity trials, to support an application for marketing approval. For a product approved under the Animal Rule, certain additional post-marketing requirements apply. For example, to the extent feasible and ethical, applicants must conduct post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the drug's clinical benefit and to assess its safety when used as indicated. We have limited experience in the application of these rules to the product candidates that we are developing. It is possible that results from these animal efficacy studies may not be predictive of the actual efficacy of our product candidates in humans.
 
Under Project BioShield, the Secretary of HHS can contract to purchase MCMs for the SNS prior to FDA approval of the countermeasure in specified circumstances. Project BioShield also allows the FDA commissioner to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization. If our product candidates are not selected under this Project BioShield authority, they generally will have to be approved by the FDA through traditional regulatory mechanisms for distribution in the United States.
 
We may experience unforeseen events or issues during, or as a result of, preclinical testing, clinical trials or animal efficacy studies. These issues and events, which could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, include, among others:
 
§  our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in trials;
 §  the unavailability or variability in the number and types of subjects for each study;
 §  safety issues or inconclusive or incomplete testing, trial or study results;
 §  drug immunogenicity;
 §  lack of efficacy of product candidates during the trials;
 §  government or regulatory restrictions or delays; and
 §  greater than anticipated costs of trials.
 
We depend on third parties to conduct our clinical and non-clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and, as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may suffer.
 
We do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical and non-clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We depend on third parties, such as independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical and non-clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so. We rely heavily on these third parties for successful execution of our clinical and non-clinical trials, but do not exercise day-to-day control over their activities. Our reliance on these service providers does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our trials are conducted in accordance with good clinical practice regulations and the plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application. In addition, these organizations may not complete these activities on our anticipated or desired timeframe. We also may experience unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a contract research organization may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternative service provider, which may prove difficult, costly and result in a delay of our trials. Any delay in or inability to complete our trials could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates.
 
In certain cases, government entities and non-government organizations conduct studies of our product candidates, and we may seek to rely on these studies in applying for marketing approval for certain of our product candidates. These government entities and non-government organizations have no obligation or commitment to us to conduct or complete any of these studies or clinical trials and may choose to discontinue these development efforts at any time. Furthermore, government entities depend on annual Congressional appropriations to fund their development efforts, which may not be approved.
 
If we are unable to obtain any necessary third-party services on acceptable terms or if these service providers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.
 
We may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates.
 
We continue to evaluate our product development strategy and, as a result, may modify our strategy in the future. In this regard, we may, from time to time, focus our product development efforts on different product candidates or may delay or halt the development of various product candidates. We may change or refocus our existing product development, commercialization and manufacturing activities based on government funding decisions. This could require changes in our facilities and our personnel. Any product development changes that we implement may not be successful. In particular, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates or choose candidates for which government development funds are not available. Our decisions to allocate our research and development, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate product development programs may also prove to be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS
 
If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.
 
Our success, especially with respect to our small molecule product candidates, will depend, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology, products and product candidates. Obtaining and maintaining this protection is very costly. The patentability of technology in the biopharmaceutical field generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions.
 
We may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products. Even if issued, patents may inadvertently lapse or be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the duration of patent protection we may have for our products. In the past, we have abandoned the prosecution and/or maintenance of patent applications related to patent families in the ordinary course of business. In the future we may choose to abandon such prosecution and/or maintenance in a similar fashion. If these patent rights are later determined to be valuable or necessary to our business, our competitive position may be adversely affected. Changes in patent laws or administrative patent office rules or changes in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and in other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, or result in costly defensive measures.  In addition, some countries do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and, in these countries, patent protection may not be available at all to protect our products or product candidates.
 
The cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents to prevent infringement or to otherwise protect or enforce our proprietary rights could be substantial and, from time to time, our patents are subject to opposition proceedings. Some of our competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation because they may have substantially greater financial resources. Intellectual property lawsuits are expensive and unpredictable and would consume management's time and attention and other resources, even if the outcome were successful. In addition, there is a risk that a court would decide that our patents are not valid, are unenforceable, or must be interpreted narrowly and that we do not have the right to stop another party from using the inventions covered by or incorporating them. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of a patent were upheld, a court would refuse to stop the other party from using the invention(s), including on the grounds that its activities do not infringe the patent. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Our collaborators and licensors may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. These third parties may have the first right to maintain or defend intellectual property rights in which we have an interest and, although we may have the right to assume the maintenance and defense of such intellectual property rights if these third parties do not do so, our ability to maintain and defend such intellectual property rights may be compromised by the acts or omissions of these third parties. For example, we license from Pfizer, Inc. an oligonucleotide adjuvant, CPG 7909, for use in our NuThrax anthrax vaccine product candidate.
 
We also will rely on current and future trademarks to establish and maintain recognized brands. If we fail to acquire and protect such trademarks, our ability to market and sell our products, and therefore our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Third parties may choose to file patent infringement claims against us; defending ourselves from such allegations would be costly, time-consuming, distracting to management and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
 
Our development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties for which we do not hold sufficient licenses or other rights. Additionally, third parties may be successful in obtaining patent protection for technologies that cover development and commercialization activities in which we are already engaged. Third parties may own or control these patents and intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. These third parties may have substantially greater financial resources than us and could bring claims against us that could cause us to incur substantial expenses to defend against these claims and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement or other similar suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. Intellectual property litigation in the biopharmaceutical industry is common, and we expect this trend to continue.
 
As a result of patent infringement or other similar claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations. If, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms, if at all, or if an injunction is granted against us, these could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
 
If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.
 
We are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license and/or sue us for breach, which could cause us to not be able to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents and subject us to damages, which may be material.
 
If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.
 
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how, particularly as to our proprietary manufacturing processes. Because we do not have patent protection for all of our current products, our only other intellectual property protection for products, other than trademarks, is confidentiality regarding our manufacturing capability and specialty know-how, such as techniques, processes and unique starting materials. However, these types of confidential information and trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect this confidential information, in part, through agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties as well as confidentiality policies and audits, although these may not be successful in protecting our trade secrets and confidential information.
 
These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known, including through a potential cyber security breach, or may be independently developed by competitors. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, competitors may be able to use this information to develop products that compete with our products, which could materially and adversely impact our business.
 
FINANCIAL RISKS
 
Our current indebtedness and any additional debt financing may restrict the operation of our business and limit the cash available for investment in our business operations.
 
We recently entered into a five-year $200 million syndicated senior secured revolving credit facility that replaced our prior $100 million facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2018. The senior secured credit facility also includes a $100 million accordion feature in revolver or incremental term loans, at our option, which could expand total commitments to up to $300 million subject to certain conditions and requirements under the credit agreement. We may also seek additional debt financing to support our ongoing activities or to provide additional financial flexibility. Debt financing could have significant adverse consequences for our business, including:
 
 
§ | requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to payment on our debt, which would reduce the amounts available to fund other corporate initiatives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | increasing the amount of interest that we have to pay on debt with variable interest rates, if market rates of interest increase;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | subjecting us, as under our senior secured revolving credit facility, to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions, acquire companies, products or technology, or obtain further debt financing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | requiring us to pledge our assets as collateral, which could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, better debt servicing options or stronger debt servicing capacity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain additional financing to pay the amounts due under our indebtedness. In addition, failure to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments could result in an event of default under those instruments. An event of default could result in the acceleration of amounts due under a particular debt instrument and a cross default and acceleration under other debt instruments, and we may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain additional financing to make any accelerated payments. Under these circumstances, our lenders could seek to enforce security interests in our assets securing our indebtedness.
 
We may require significant additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, which would harm our ability to grow our business, and our results of operations and financial condition.
 
We may require significant additional funding to grow our business, including efforts to acquire other companies or products, in-license and develop additional products, enhance our manufacturing capacity, support commercial marketing activities or otherwise provide additional financial flexibility. We may also require additional funding to support our ongoing operations in the event that our ability to sell BioThrax to the U.S. government is interrupted for an extended period of time, reducing our BioThrax revenues and decreasing our cash balances.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $178.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:
 
 
§ | the level, timing and cost of product sales;
--+---------------------------------------------


§ | the extent to which we acquire or invest in and integrate companies, businesses, products or technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the acquisition of new facilities and capital improvements to new or existing facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the payment obligations under our indebtedness;
--+------------------------------------------------


§ | the scope, progress, results and costs of our development activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | our ability to obtain funding from collaborative partners, government entities and non-governmental organizations for our development programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the extent to which we repurchase additional common stock under a new share repurchase program; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, bank loans or collaboration and licensing arrangements. In May 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which immediately became effective under SEC rules. For so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a "well-known seasoned issuer" under SEC rules, this shelf registration statement, effective until May 2018, allows us to issue an unrestricted amount of equity, debt and certain other types of securities through one or more future primary or secondary offerings. If we do not file a new shelf registration statement prior to May 2018, the existing shelf registration statement will expire and we will not be able to publicly raise capital or issue debt until a new registration statement is filed and becomes effective. There can be no assurance that we will be eligible to file an automatically effective shelf registration statement at a future date when we may need to raise funds publicly.
 
If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Public or bank debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants, like those contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility, limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021, or Senior Convertible Notes, from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. However, our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.
 
Economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected and we could be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.
 
We may not maintain profitability in future periods or on a consistent basis.
 
Although we have been profitable for each of the last five fiscal years, we have not been profitable for every quarter during that time. For example, we incurred a net loss in the second quarter of 2016 and in each of the first quarters of 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Our profitability has been substantially dependent on BioThrax product sales, which historically have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate significantly based primarily on the timing of our fulfillment of orders from the U.S. government. We may not be able to achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly basis or sustain or increase profitability on an annual basis.
 
THE SPIN-OFF OF OUR BIOSCIENCES BUSINESS
 
If the spin-off distribution on August 1, 2016 of all of the outstanding shares of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. common stock to our stockholders does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.
 
It was our intention that our distribution on August 1, 2016 of all of the outstanding shares of Aptevo common stock to our stockholders, or the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualify as a tax-free transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In anticipation of the Distribution, we received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Distribution and certain related transactions and an opinion of counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. A "private letter ruling," is a written statement issued to a taxpayer by an Associate Chief Counsel Office of the Office of Chief Counsel that interprets and applies the tax laws to a specific set of facts. Our private letter ruling is based on certain facts and representations submitted by us to the IRS and the opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, the IRS private letter ruling and certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations and covenants of us and Aptevo contained in a tax matters agreement and certain representations contained in representation letters provided by us, Aptevo and certain stockholders to such counsel, including representations and covenants relating to the past and future conduct of us, Aptevo and such stockholders. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or covenants are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized and, as a result, the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, could fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
In addition, the IRS private letter ruling only addresses certain limited matters relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, and the opinion of counsel only represents the judgment of such counsel, which is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, notwithstanding the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.
 
If the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in general, (i) we would recognize taxable gain on the Distribution equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the Aptevo shares distributed to our shareholders exceeded our tax basis in the Aptevo shares and (ii) each of our shareholders who received Aptevo shares in the Distribution would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of the Aptevo shares received by such shareholder.
 
Under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Aptevo in connection with the spin-off, Aptevo may be required to indemnify us against any tax liabilities and related expenses resulting from the failure of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, to qualify as a transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Aptevo's stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by Aptevo in the tax matters agreement or the IRS private letter ruling or in the representation letters provided  to our counsel for purposes of their opinion. Any such indemnity obligations could be material, and there can be no assurance that Aptevo will be able to pay any such indemnification.
 
To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, and in addition to Aptevo's indemnity obligation, the tax matters agreement restricts Aptevo from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, for the two-year period following the Distribution, Aptevo is restricted from taking certain actions (including restrictions on share issuances, business combinations, sales of assets, amendments to organizational documents and similar transactions) that could cause the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that Aptevo will comply with these restrictions. Failure of Aptevo to satisfy its obligations could have a substantial impact on our tax obligations, consolidated financial condition and cash flows.
 
In connection with Aptevo's separation from us, Aptevo agreed to indemnify us for certain matters. This indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of losses that we may incur in connection with these matters, and Aptevo may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us.
 
Pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with Aptevo at the time of Aptevo's separation from us, Aptevo agreed to indemnify us for certain matters, including liabilities related to Aptevo's business or for which Aptevo otherwise agreed to be responsible in the separation. This indemnity from Aptevo may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of losses that we may incur in connection with these matters, including if third parties assert claims against us for liabilities that were allocated to Aptevo in the separation. Moreover, Aptevo may dispute its indemnification obligation to us or have insufficient resources to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Aptevo the amount of any losses that we incur in connection with these matters, the recovery could take a substantial amount of time and we may be required to bear these losses ourselves while we seek recovery. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
OTHER BUSINESS RISKS
 
 Pending litigation and legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
From time to time, we may be named as a defendant in various legal actions or other proceedings. Certain of these actions include and future actual or threatened legal actions may include, claims for substantial and indeterminate amounts of damages, or may result in other action adverse to us.
 
For example, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and several of our senior officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland seeking unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between January 11, 2016 and June 21, 2016. The complaint, as amended on December 27, 2016, alleges, among other things, that we made materially false and misleading statements about the government's demand for BioThrax and expectations that our five-year exclusive procurement contract with HHS would be renewed and omitted certain material facts.
 
The results of this lawsuit and possible other future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, we cannot determine whether our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover the costs or potential losses, if any. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. If we do not prevail in the purported class action lawsuit or in other future legal proceedings, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We face product liability exposure, which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our products, any other products that we successfully acquire or develop and the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials.
 
One measure of protection against such lawsuits is coverage under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, which was signed into law in December 2005. The PREP Act creates liability protection for manufacturers of biodefense countermeasures when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. A PREP Act declaration is meant to provide liability protection from all claims under federal or state law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure under a government contract. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations identifying certain of our products, namely BioThrax, ACAM2000, Raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, as covered countermeasures. These declarations expire in 2022. Manufacturers are not entitled to protection under the PREP Act in cases of willful misconduct. We cannot predict whether the Secretary of HHS will renew the declarations when they expire, whether Congress will fund the relevant PREP Act compensation programs, or whether the necessary prerequisites for immunity would be triggered with respect to our products or product candidates.
 
Additionally, certain of our products, namely BioThrax and RSDL, are certified anti-terrorism products covered under the protections of the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002, or SAFETY Act. The SAFETY Act creates product liability limitations for qualifying anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising from or related to an act of terrorism. Although we are entitled to the benefits of the SAFETY Act for BioThrax and RSDL, the SAFETY Act may not provide adequate protection from claims made against us.
 
If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against future claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries and if we are not entitled to indemnity by the U.S. government, or the U.S. government does not honor its obligations to us under the PREP Act or SAFETY Act, or if the indemnification under the PREP Act and SAFETY Act is not adequate to cover all claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:
 
 
§ | decreased demand or withdrawal of a product;
--+---------------------------------------------


§ | injury to our reputation;
--+--------------------------


§ | withdrawal of clinical trial participants;
--+-------------------------------------------


§ | costs to defend the related litigation;
--+----------------------------------------


§ | substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


§ | loss of revenue; and
--+---------------------


§ | an inability to commercialize products that we may develop.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



The amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that may occur. Further product liability insurance may be difficult and expensive to obtain. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy all potential liabilities. For example, we may not have sufficient insurance against potential liabilities associated with a possible large scale deployment of BioThrax as a countermeasure to a bioterrorism threat. We rely on PREP Act protection for BioThrax, Raxibacumab, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, and SAFETY Act protection for BioThrax and RSDL in addition to our insurance coverage to help mitigate our product liability exposure for these products. Claims or losses in excess of our product liability insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and our ability to meet our reporting obligations could be negatively affected, each of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.
 
Internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could impact our financial information and disclosures, require significant resources to remediate, and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings.
 
We regularly review and update our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal controls, however well-designed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial reporting, and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.
 
We rely significantly on information technology systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively or result in data leakage of proprietary and confidential business and employee information.
 
Our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including Internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to interruption, invasion, computer viruses, destruction, malicious intrusion and additional related disruptions, which may result in the impairment of production and key business processes.
 
In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches—whether by employee error, malfeasance or other disruption—which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information, including sensitive personal information, of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers and others.
 
A significant business disruption or a breach in security resulting in misappropriation, theft or sabotage with respect to our proprietary and confidential business and employee information could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
Our success is dependent on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and any failure to attract or retain key personnel may negatively affect our business.
 
Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors largely depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial and key scientific and technical personnel. If we are unable to retain the services of one or more of the principal members of senior management or other key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy could be materially harmed. We face intense competition for qualified employees from biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and academic institutions. Attracting, retaining or replacing these personnel on acceptable terms may be difficult and time-consuming given the high demand in our industry for similar personnel. We believe part of being able to attract, motivate and retain personnel is our ability to offer a competitive compensation package, including equity incentive awards. If we cannot offer a competitive compensation package to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow our business.
 
RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
 
Fuad El-Hibri, executive chairman of our Board of Directors, has significant influence over us through his substantial beneficial ownership of our common stock, including an ability to influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors, or delay or prevent a change of control of us.
 
Mr. El-Hibri has the ability to significantly influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors due to his substantial beneficial ownership of our common stock. As of February 16, 2018, Mr. El-Hibri was the beneficial owner of approximately 11% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. El-Hibri could exercise substantial influence over all corporate actions requiring board or stockholder approval, including a change of control, or any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws. The control by Mr. El-Hibri may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. In addition, Mr. El-Hibri's significant beneficial ownership of our shares could present the potential for a conflict of interest.
 
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law may discourage acquisition proposals, delay a change in control or prevent transactions that stockholders may consider favorable.
 
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other changes in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.
 
These provisions include:
 
 
§ | the classification of our directors;
--+-------------------------------------


§ | limitations on changing the number of directors then in office;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


§ | limitations on the removal of directors;
--+-----------------------------------------


§ | limitations on filling vacancies on the board;
--+-----------------------------------------------


§ | advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors and other proposals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the inability of stockholders to act by written consent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


§ | the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The affirmative vote of holders of our capital stock representing at least 75% of the voting power of all outstanding stock entitled to vote is required to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation. The affirmative vote of either a majority of the directors present at a meeting of our Board of Directors or holders of our capital stock representing at least 75% of the voting power of all outstanding stock entitled to vote is required to amend or repeal our by-laws.
 
In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or Section 203. In general and subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Section 203 may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us.
 
Our Board of Directors may implement a new stockholder rights plan without stockholder approval, which could prevent a change in control of us in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests.
 
Our Board of Directors may implement a stockholder rights plan without stockholder approval. We previously implemented a stockholder rights plan, which expired on November 14, 2016. Under our prior stockholder rights plan, we issued to each of our stockholders one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock. Each right, when exercisable, would have entitled its holder to purchase from us a unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of series A junior participating preferred stock at a purchase price of $150 in cash, subject to adjustments. Our stockholder rights plan was intended to protect stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us and to provide our Board of Directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers.
 
Our Board of Directors may implement a new stockholder rights plan, which may have anti-takeover effects, potentially preventing a change in control of us in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests. This could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms that our Board of Directors does not believe are in our best interests or those of our stockholders and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
 
Our stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.
 
Our stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this "Risk Factors" section, or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. From November 15, 2006, when our common stock first began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, through February 16, 2018, our common stock has traded as high as $51.25 per share and as low as $4.40 per share. The stock market in general as well as the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, among others:
 
 
§ | contracts, decisions and procurement policies by the U.S. government affecting BioThrax and our other products and product candidates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the success of competitive products or technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


§ | results of clinical and non-clinical trials of our product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | announcements of acquisitions, financings or other transactions by us;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | litigation or legal proceedings;
--+---------------------------------


§ | public concern as to the safety of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------


§ | termination or delay of a development program;
--+-----------------------------------------------


§ | the recruitment or departure of key personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------


§ | variations in our product revenue and profitability; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


§ | the other factors described in this "Risk Factors" section.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



Because we currently do not pay dividends, investors will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
 
We currently do not pay dividends on our common stock. Our senior secured credit facility limits and any future debt agreements that we enter into may limit our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.
 
A significant portion of our shares may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.
 
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, holders of an aggregate of approximately 6 million shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 16, 2018, have the right to require us to register these shares of common stock under specified circumstances. In May 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which immediately became effective under SEC rules. For so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a "well-known seasoned issuer" under SEC rules, this shelf registration statement, effective until May 2018, would provide for a secondary offering of these shares from time to time.
