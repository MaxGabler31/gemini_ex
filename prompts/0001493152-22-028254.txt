Sequire
 
The Sequire platform is a central hub where companies can manage certain administrative functions, reach out and engage with shareholders as well as identify potential new investors. The platform utilizes machine learning and advanced analytics to bring our clients actionable information that we believe can be used to maximize ROI through better investor and stockholder communications. Clients then can engage with targeted shareholder groups across marketing channels including email, social media, programmatic, and hyperlocal.
 
When interpreting data, clients can see gains and losses over time, buying/selling trends, total outstanding shares, new shareholders, and shareholders broken out by percentage. Based on this data, we can assist our users in developing customized communications campaign utilizing targeted ads and messaging.
 
Among other features, the Sequire platform provides its users tools to monitor investor sentiment and activities and simplify back office administration such as:
 

● | real-time level-two trading data,

● | custom survey feature to enhance shareholder communications; 
● | real-time and searchable warrant and option ledgers; and 
● | integrated communication between investor relations programs and corporate communication firms. 

Data Targeting
 
We help our clients build an investor base through targeted advertising and marketing campaigns, tailored to their needs. Using data-driven insights, we help clients meet their unique marketing objectives, whether they’re messaging existing investors, new investors, or consumers.

Website Disclosing the Value of our Securities Portfolio
 
Pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents in our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility entered into on August 8, 2022, we are required to disseminate more current information regarding our portfolio of securities that we receive from customers. Accordingly, we have elected to disseminate such required information via a website at https://srax.com/stock-portfolio (the “Portfolio Website”). The most current information about the portfolio of securities will be available on the Portfolio Website, which will be updated daily. Additionally, the Portfolio Website describes or details the value of such portfolio of securities separately that are currently restricted or unrestricted. The Portfolio Website additionally outlines the dollar value of securities that have been sold in a given quarter.
 
Individuals accessing the Portfolio Website are cautioned that the value of securities contained on the Portfolio Website are calculated by multiplying the quoted price of each security on its applicable exchange or interdealer quotation system, by the quantity owned. This method does not take into account any adjustment of value based on liquidity, the potential lack of an active market, excessive bid-ask spread, and other inputs used generally for valuing securities under the generally accepted principles of accounting (GAAP), the financial accounting standards board (FASB) and U.S. securities laws. Accordingly, the dollar values contained on the Portfolio Website may not be indicative of the fair value of the securities that we own, and the value for which we may be able to sell such securities could be materially and substantially less than that presented on the Portfolio Website. Additionally, the value of the securities contained on the Portfolio Website may be materially different from the value ascribed to such securities in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Further, as a result of the potential holding periods of such securities and other restrictions on transferability or sale, we may, with respect to any specific security, (i) realize substantially less value upon the sale of such security or (ii) realize no value at all. Additionally, any disclosure with regard to the ability to sell as a result of such securities being unrestricted is subject to change and is highly dependent on facts that may change and that we have no control over. Any projections of sales for any future quarter or other time period are forward looking and speculative and you should not place any reliance on such projections. In addition, the values of securities listed on the Portfolio Website do not take into account any embedded features that may result in the adjustment of any conversion prices or issuance of additional shares. You are further cautioned not to rely on the values listed on the Portfolio Website for purposes of determining the fair value of our portfolio of securities.
 
Our team of experts takes a deep dive into each company, building out unique messaging to suit their target investors. Once media campaigns are built, they are run through the Sequire platform across multiple target segments. We then track performance and modify the campaign for the best possible results. Our clients have needs to target particular sectors and exchanges, and the value we deliver lies in the hyper-specific investor insights necessary for that kind of focused outreach.
 
We are maximizing the efficacy of our media campaigns by providing our clients with custom-built landing pages that are crafted to educate, engage, and convert new investors. When a new investor clicks through an ad, they will land on a story-driven page with data-tracking software embedded to collect analytics for later use.
 
Virtual Events and LD Micro
 
LD Micro is the premier event platform for micro-cap and small cap companies. In September of 2020, we acquired LD Micro, and hosted the 2020 Main Event on our Sequire Virtual Events platform. The 2021 Main Event had over 3,000 attendees and hosted webinars with over 500 companies. We are currently planning to expand the number and subject matter of our conferences and events. Through the events platform, we have the ability to host a variety of virtual events and conferences including investor conferences, earnings calls, shareholder meetings, annual, investor/analyst days, corporate town halls, roadshows, and more. We believe that our ability to offer users a seamless, centrally managed virtual events solution that can be customized to any industry will help transform our platform into the premier investor event tool.
 
Marketing and sales
 
We market our services through our in-house sales and marketing team. Our team focuses on social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, public relations (PR), industry events and the creation of white papers which assist in our marketing efforts and are used as lead generation tools.
 
Intellectual property
 
We currently rely on a combination of patents, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We currently have eight (8) US patent applications filed.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve matters central to our business. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. We are also subject to many of the laws that cover the securities industry and are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
These laws may involve privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
 
Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.

We may become the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into in July 2019 with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which is pending federal court approval and which, among other matters, will require us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of August 31, 2022, we had 10 full-time employees. Of these employees, 5 are engaged in executive management, 68 in information technology including those participating in our research and development efforts, 17 in sales and marketing, 28 in integration and customer support and 12 in administration. All employees are employed “at will.” We believe our relations with our employees are generally positive and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel, whether existing employees or new hires, through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards. We believe that this increases value to our stockholders and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 
We provide our employees and their families with access to health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; and that offer choices where possible so employees can customize their benefits to meet their needs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the community in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, including working in a remote environment where appropriate or required. As of the date of this Annual Report, all of our employees are currently working remotely.
 
Our history
 
We were originally organized in August 2009 as a California limited liability company under the name Social Reality, LLC, and we converted to a Delaware corporation effective January 1, 2012. Social Reality, LLC began business in May 2010. Upon the conversion, we changed our name to Social Reality, Inc. On August 15, 2019, we formally changed our Name to SRAX, Inc. In September of 2020, we acquired LD Micro as a wholly owned subsidiary. In February of 2021 we completed the divestiture of our BIGToken subsidiary and the related platform.
 
Additional information
 
We file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or the “Commission”). The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Commission at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330.
