ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Air Lease Corporation (the “Company”, “ALC”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a leading aircraft leasing company that was founded by aircraft leasing industry pioneer, Steven F. Udvar-Házy. We are principally engaged in purchasing the most modern, fuel-efficient new technology commercial jet aircraft directly from aircraft manufacturers, such as The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) and Airbus S.A.S.(“Airbus”), and leasing those aircraft to airlines throughout the world with the intention to generate attractive returns on equity. In addition to our leasing activities, we sell aircraft from our fleet to third parties, including other leasing companies, financial services companies, airlines and other investors. We also provide fleet management services to investors and owners of aircraft portfolios for a management fee. Our operating performance is driven by the growth of our fleet, the terms of our leases, the interest rates on our debt, and the aggregate amount of our indebtedness, supplemented by gains from aircraft sales and our management fees.
We currently have relationships with over 200 airlines across 70 countries. We operate our business on a global basis, providing aircraft to airline customers in every major geographical region, including markets such as Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, U.S. and Canada, the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and Central America, South America and Mexico. As air travel continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect demand for our modern fuel-efficient aircraft will continue to increase. In markets such as the United States and Western Europe, our strategy is to focus on the replacement market as many airlines look to replace aging aircraft with new, modern technology, fuel efficient jet aircraft. In less saturated markets, including parts of Asia, in addition to the replacement market, we serve customers expanding their fleets.
Many of these markets are experiencing increased demand for passenger airline travel and have lower market saturation than more mature markets such as the United States and Western Europe. We expect that these markets will also present significant replacement opportunities in upcoming years as many airlines look to replace aging aircraft with new, modern technology, fuel efficient jet aircraft. An important focus of our strategy is meeting the needs of this replacement market. Airlines in some of these markets have fewer financing alternatives, enabling us to command relatively higher lease rates compared to those in more mature markets.
We mitigate the risks of owning and leasing aircraft through careful management and diversification of our leases and lessees by geography, lease term, and aircraft age and type. We believe that diversification of our fleet reduces the risks associated with individual lessee defaults and adverse geopolitical and regional economic events. We mitigate the risks associated with cyclical variations in the airline industry by managing customer concentrations and lease maturities in our fleet to minimize periods of concentrated lease expirations. In order to maximize residual values and minimize the risk of obsolescence, our strategy is to own an aircraft during the first third of its expected 25-year useful life.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased 53 new aircraft from our orderbook with Boeing and Airbus and sold three aircraft, ending the period with a total of 382 aircraft in our owned fleet. The net book value of our fleet grew by 12.4% to $22.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to $20.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average age of our fleet was 4.4 years and the weighted average lease term remaining was 7.2 years as of December 31, 2021. Our managed fleet increased to 92 aircraft as of December 31, 2021 as compared to 81 as of December 31, 2020. We have a globally diversified customer base comprised of 118 airlines in 60 countries. As of February 17, 2022, all aircraft in our fleet, except for one aircraft, were subject to lease agreements or letters of intent.
As of December 31, 2021, and giving effect to our conversion of three Boeing 787 aircraft to 18 737 MAX aircraft in February 2022, we had commitments to purchase 431 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus for delivery through 2028, with an estimated aggregate commitment of $27.7 billion. We have placed 99% of our orderbook on long-term leases for aircraft delivering through the end of 2023 and have placed 58% of our entire orderbook. We ended 2021 with $30.9 billion in committed minimum future rental payments, consisting of $14.8 billion in contracted minimum rental payments on the aircraft in our existing fleet and $16.1 billion in minimum future rental payments related to aircraft which will deliver between 2022 and 2025. 
We finance the purchase of aircraft and our business with available cash balances, internally generated funds from our aircraft leasing and sales activities, and debt financings. Our debt financing strategy is focused on raising unsecured debt in the global bank and debt capital markets, with limited utilization of government guaranteed export credit or other forms of secured financing. In 2021, we issued approximately $3.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2022 to 
Table of Contents
2028 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.27%. We ended 2021 with total debt outstanding of $17.2 billion, of which 94.8% was at a fixed rate and 99.2% of which was unsecured. As of December 31, 2021, our composite cost of funds was 2.79%. 
Our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 3.6% to $2.1 billion as compared to 2020. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by the continued growth in our fleet, an increase in our cash collections from our lessees as well as an increase in our aircraft sales, trading and other activity, partially offset by the impact of cash basis accounting and lease restructurings. We were not able to recognize $72.7 million of rental revenue because collection was not reasonably assured for certain of our leases during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the impact of lease restructurings decreased total revenues by approximately $132.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our net income available to common stockholders was $408.2 million compared to $500.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the full year 2021 was $3.57 compared to $4.39 for the full year 2020. Despite the growth of our fleet, our net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share primarily decreased due to the impact of lease restructurings and cash basis accounting. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information on our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our adjusted net income before income taxes excludes the effects of certain non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future and certain other items. Our adjusted net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $589.7 million or $5.15 per diluted share, compared to $692.0 million, or $6.07 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in our adjusted net income before income taxes was primarily due to the impact of lease restructurings and cash basis accounting. Adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes are measures of financial and operational performance that are not defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). See “Results of Operations” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes as non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these measures to net income available to common stockholders.
Industry Outlook
Despite the disruption caused to the commercial airline industry by the COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020, global air travel continues to recover. The International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) reported that passenger traffic was up 80% in the month of December 2021 relative to the prior year, as many domestic markets and some international markets reopened with the rise in vaccination distribution over the course of the year. Global domestic passenger traffic in 2021 improved significantly relative to the prior year, and was 28% lower than 2019 as compared to 49% lower in 2020. Domestic markets have experienced faster recovery than international markets in 2021 given generally more relaxed travel restrictions. Total 2021 passenger traffic was 58% lower than 2019 as compared to 66% lower in 2020, primarily due to slower recovery in international passenger traffic. We believe vaccination progress and the advent of new therapeutic treatments as well as easing of travel restrictions will continue to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air passenger traffic and the commercial airline industry. However, as we have witnessed, recovery may be temporarily disrupted from time-to-time by concerns surrounding COVID-19 and its variants and resulting travel restrictions, particularly with respect to international and business air travel demand. In addition, we anticipate that cargo demand will continue to be fueled by e-commerce which we believe will create more demand for freighter aircraft.
We believe that the fundamental drivers that have historically benefited our business will continue to do so again in the future. Those drivers include: the growth of passenger traffic over time; the increased role of lessors to finance a greater share of the world’s fleet; and the need and desire for airlines to replace aging aircraft. The replacement cycle of aging aircraft has been accelerated as airlines initially adapted to lower levels of passenger traffic during the pandemic. However, as the world continues to recover from the pandemic, rising fuel costs and environmental sustainability initiatives are driving demand for new aircraft.
Moving forward, we believe that certain factors that have supported air travel in the past will ultimately drive demand for air travel and our aircraft going forward, including: the potential for growth in the middle class worldwide, a shift in spending habits to prioritize experiences, and the cost of air travel which can often be lower than other expenditures largely driven by fares offered by low-cost carriers. We believe that the recovery of passenger traffic as we move forward will continue to be reliant on the implementation and understanding of safety measures by passengers, such as wearing masks and rapid testing; the distribution of effective vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19; and finally, removal of travel restrictions.

(1) A customer is an airline with its own operating certificate.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, China was the only individual country that represented at least 10% of our rental revenue based on each airline's principal place of business. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, no rental revenue from any individual airline represented 10% or more of our rental revenue. Our customer base is highly diversified, with our average customer representing approximately 1.0% of our fleet net book value as of December 31, 2021.
Aircraft Acquisition Strategy
We seek to acquire the most highly in demand and widely distributed, modern technology, fuel efficient and lowest emissions narrowbody and widebody commercial jet aircraft. Our strategy is to order new aircraft directly from the manufacturers. When placing new aircraft orders with the manufacturers, we strategically target the replacement of aging aircraft with modern technology aircraft. Additionally, we look to supplement our order pipeline with opportunistic purchases of aircraft in the secondary market and participate in sale-leaseback transactions with airlines. In addition to our focus on commercial aircraft, we are expanding our focus to include the cargo market based on customer demand. 
Prior to ordering aircraft, we evaluate the market for specific types of aircraft. We consider the overall demand for the aircraft type in the marketplace based on our deep knowledge of the aviation industry and our customer relationships. It is important to assess the airplane’s economic viability, the operating performance characteristics, engine variant options, intended utilization by our customers, and which aircraft types it will replace or compete within the global market. Additionally, we study the effects of global airline passenger traffic growth in order to determine the likely demand for our new aircraft upon delivery.
For new aircraft deliveries, we source many components separately, which include seats, safety equipment, avionics, galleys, cabin finishes, engines, and other equipment. Oftentimes, we are able to achieve lower pricing through direct bulk purchase contracts with the component manufacturers than would be achievable if we relied on the airframe manufacturers to source the components for the aircraft themselves. Airframe manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus install these buyer furnished equipment in our aircraft during the final assembly process at their facilities. With this purchasing strategy, we are able to both meet specific customer configuration requirements and lower our total acquisition cost of the aircraft.
Aircraft Leasing Strategy
The airline industry is complex with constantly evolving competition, code shares (where two or more airlines share the same flight), alliances, and passenger traffic patterns. This requires frequent updating and flexibility within an airline’s fleet. The operating lease allows airlines to effectively adapt and manage their fleets through varying market conditions without bearing the full financial risk associated with these capital intensive assets which have an expected useful life of 25 years. This fleet flexibility enables airlines to more effectively operate and compete in their respective markets. We work closely with our airline customers throughout the world to help optimize their long-term aircraft fleet strategies. We may also, from time to time, work with our airline customers to assist them in obtaining financing for aircraft. 
Table of Contents
We work to mitigate the risks associated with owning and leasing aircraft and cyclical variations in the airline industry through careful management of our fleet, including managing customer concentrations by geography and region, entering into long-term leases, staggering lease maturities, balancing aircraft type exposures, and maintaining a young fleet age. We believe that diversification of our fleet reduces the risks associated with individual customer defaults and the impact of adverse geopolitical and regional economic events. In order to maximize residual values and minimize the risk of obsolescence, our strategy is generally to own an aircraft for approximately the first third of its expected 25-year useful life.
Our management team identifies prospective airline customers based upon industry knowledge and long-standing relationships. Prior to leasing an aircraft, we evaluate the competitive positioning of the airline, the strength and quality of the management team, and the financial performance of the airline. Management obtains and reviews relevant business materials from all prospective customers before entering into a lease agreement. Under certain circumstances, the customer may be required to obtain guarantees or other financial support from a sovereign entity or a financial institution. We work closely with our existing customers and potential lessees to develop customized lease structures that address their specific needs. We typically enter into a lease agreement 18 to 36 months in advance of the delivery of a new aircraft from our orderbook. Once the aircraft has been delivered and operated by the airline, we look to remarket the aircraft and sign a follow-on lease six to 12 months ahead of the scheduled expiry of the initial lease term. 
Our leases are typically structured as operating leases with fixed rates and terms and typically require cash security deposits and maintenance reserve payments. In addition, our leases are all structured as triple net leases, whereby the lessee is responsible for all operating costs, including taxes, insurance and maintenance and also contain provisions which require payment whether or not the aircraft is operated, irrespective of the circumstances. Substantially all of our leases require payments to be made in U.S. dollars. 
In addition, our leases require the lessee to be responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to the aircraft. We require our lessees to comply with the standards of either the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) or its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions. As a function of these laws and the provisions in our lease contracts, the lessees are responsible for performing all maintenance of the aircraft and returning the aircraft and its components in a specified return condition. Generally, we receive a cash deposit and maintenance reserves as security for the lessee’s performance of its obligations under the lease and the condition of the aircraft upon return. In addition, most leases contain extensive provisions regarding our remedies and rights in the event of a default by a lessee. The lessee generally is required to continue to make lease payments under all circumstances, including periods during which the aircraft is not in operation due to maintenance or grounding.
Some foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies. When necessary, we may require, as a condition to any foreign transaction, that the lessee or purchaser in a foreign country obtain the necessary approvals of the appropriate government agency, finance ministry, or central bank for the remittance of all funds contractually owed in U.S. dollars. We attempt to minimize our currency and exchange risks by negotiating the designated payment currency in our leases to be U.S. dollars. To meet the needs of certain of our airline customers, we have agreed to accept certain lease payments in a foreign currency. After we agree to the rental payment currency with an airline, the negotiated currency typically remains for the term of the lease. We may enter into contracts to mitigate our foreign currency risk, but we expect that the economic risk arising from foreign currency denominated leases will be immaterial to us.
We may, in connection with the lease of used aircraft, agree to contribute specific additional amounts to the cost of certain first major maintenance events or modifications, which usually reflect the usage of the aircraft prior to the commencement of the lease. We may be obligated under the leases to make reimbursements of maintenance reserves previously received to lessees for expenses incurred for certain planned major maintenance. We also, on occasion, may contribute towards aircraft modifications and recover any such costs over the life of the lease.
Monitoring
During the lease term, we closely follow the operating and financial performance of our lessees. We maintain a high level of communication with the lessee and frequently evaluate the state of the market in which the lessee operates, including the impact of changes in passenger air travel and preferences, the impact of delivery delays, changes in general economic conditions, emerging competition, new government regulations, regional catastrophes, and other unforeseen shocks that are relevant to the airline’s market. This enables us to identify lessees that may be experiencing operating and financial difficulties. This identification assists us in assessing the lessee’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the lease. This monitoring also identifies candidates, where appropriate, to 
Table of Contents
restructure the lease prior to the lessee’s insolvency or the initiation of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Once an insolvency or bankruptcy occurs, we typically have less control over, and would most likely incur greater costs in connection with, the restructuring of the lease or the repossession of the aircraft.
During the life of the lease, situations, such as the current pandemic, may lead us to restructure leases with our lessees. When we repossess an aircraft leased in a foreign country, we generally expect to export the aircraft from the lessee’s jurisdiction. In some very limited situations, the lessees may not fully cooperate in returning the aircraft. In those cases, we will take appropriate legal action, a process that could ultimately delay the return and export of the aircraft. In addition, in connection with the repossession of an aircraft, we may be required to pay outstanding mechanics’ liens, airport charges, navigation fees and other amounts secured by liens on the repossessed aircraft. These charges could relate to other aircraft that we do not own but were operated by the lessee.
Remarketing
Our lease agreements are generally structured to require lessees to notify us nine to 12 months in advance of the lease’s expiration if a lessee desires to renew or extend the lease. Requiring lessees to provide us with such advance notice provides our management team with an extended period of time to consider a broad set of alternatives with respect to the aircraft, including assessing general market and competitive conditions and preparing to remarket or sell the aircraft. If a lessee fails to provide us with notice, the lease will automatically expire at the end of the term, and the lessee will be required to return the aircraft pursuant to the conditions in the lease. As discussed above, our leases contain detailed provisions regarding the required condition of the aircraft and its components upon return at the end of the lease term.
Aircraft Sales & Trading Strategy
Our strategy is to maintain a portfolio of young modern aircraft with a widely diversified customer base. In order to achieve this profile, we primarily order new planes directly from the manufacturers, place them on long-term leases, and sell the aircraft when they near the end of the first third of their expected 25-year economic useful life. We typically sell aircraft that are currently operated by an airline with multiple years of lease term remaining on the contract, in order to achieve the maximum disposition value of the aircraft. Buyers of the aircraft may include other leasing companies, financial institutions, airlines and other investors. We also, from time to time, buy and sell aircraft on an opportunistic basis for trading profits. Additionally, as discussed below, we may provide management services to buyers of our aircraft assets for a fee.
Aircraft Management Strategy
We supplement our core business model by providing fleet management services to third-party investors and owners of aircraft portfolios for a management fee. This allows us to better serve our airline customers and expand our existing airline customer base by providing additional leasing opportunities beyond our own aircraft portfolio, new order pipeline, and customer or regional concentration limits. As of December 31, 2021, we had a managed fleet of 92 aircraft.
Financing Strategy
We finance the purchase of aircraft and our business with available cash balances, internally generated funds, including through aircraft sales and trading activity and debt financings. We have structured the Company to have investment-grade credit metrics and our debt financing strategy has focused on funding our business on an unsecured basis. Unsecured financing provides us with operational flexibility when selling or transitioning aircraft from one airline to another. We have in the past, and we may in the future, utilize government guaranteed export credit or other forms of secured financing.
Insurance
We require our lessees to carry those types of insurance that are customary in the air transportation industry, including comprehensive liability insurance, aircraft all-risk hull insurance, and war-risk insurance covering risks such as hijacking, terrorism (but excluding coverage for weapons of mass destruction and nuclear events), confiscation, expropriation, seizure, and nationalization. We generally require a certificate of insurance from the lessee’s insurance broker prior to delivery of an aircraft. Generally, all certificates of insurance contain a breach of warranty endorsement so that our interests are not prejudiced by any act or omission of the lessee. Lease agreements generally require hull and liability limits to be in U.S. dollars, which are shown on the certificate of insurance.
Table of Contents
Insurance premiums are to be paid by the lessee, with coverage acknowledged by the broker or carrier. The territorial coverage, in each case, should be suitable for the lessee’s area of operations. We generally require that the certificates of insurance contain, among other provisions, a provision prohibiting cancellation or material change without at least 30 days’ advance written notice to the insurance broker (who would be obligated to give us prompt notice), except in the case of hull war insurance policies, which customarily only provide seven days’ advance written notice for cancellation and may be subject to shorter notice under certain market conditions. Furthermore, the insurance is primary and not contributory, and we require that all insurance carriers be required to waive rights of subrogation against us.
The stipulated loss value schedule under aircraft hull insurance policies is on an agreed-value basis acceptable to us and usually exceeds the book value of the aircraft. In cases where we believe that the agreed value stated in the lease is not sufficient, we make arrangements to cover such deficiency, which would include the purchase of additional “Total Loss Only” coverage for the deficiency.
Aircraft hull policies generally contain standard clauses covering aircraft engines. The lessee is required to pay all deductibles. Furthermore, the hull war policies generally contain full war risk endorsements, including, but not limited to, confiscation (where available), seizure, hijacking and similar forms of retention or terrorist acts.
The comprehensive liability insurance listed on certificates of insurance generally includes provisions for bodily injury, property damage, passenger liability, cargo liability, and such other provisions reasonably necessary in commercial passenger and cargo airline operations. We expect that such certificates of insurance list combined comprehensive single liability limits of not less than $500 million for Airbus and Boeing aircraft. As a standard in the industry, airline operator’s policies contain a sublimit for third-party war risk liability generally in the amount of at least $150 million. We require each lessee to purchase higher limits of third-party war risk liability or obtain an indemnity from its respective government.
The international aviation insurance market has exclusions for physical damage to aircraft hulls caused by dirty bombs, bio-hazardous materials, and electromagnetic pulsing. Exclusions for the same type of perils could be introduced into liability policies in the future.
We cannot assure you that our lessees will be adequately insured against all risks, that lessees will at all times comply with their obligations to maintain insurance, that any particular claim will be paid, or that lessees will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
Separately, we purchase contingent liability insurance and contingent hull insurance on all aircraft in our fleet and maintain other insurance covering the specific needs of our business operations. While we believe our insurance is adequate both as to coverages and amounts, we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured against all risks.
Competition
The leasing, remarketing, and sale of aircraft is highly competitive. While we are one of the largest aircraft lessors operating on a global scale, the aircraft leasing industry is diversified with a large number of competitors. We face competition from aircraft manufacturers, banks, financial institutions, other leasing companies, aircraft brokers and airlines. Some of our competitors may have greater operating and financial resources and access to lower capital costs than we have. Competition for leasing transactions is based on a number of factors, including delivery dates, lease rates, lease terms, other lease provisions, aircraft condition, and the availability in the marketplace of the types of aircraft required to meet the needs of airline customers. Competition in the purchase and sale of used aircraft is based principally on the availability of used aircraft, price, the terms of the lease to which an aircraft is subject, and the creditworthiness of the lessee, if any. 
Government Regulation
The air transportation industry is highly regulated. We do not operate commercial jet aircraft, and thus may not be directly subject to many industry laws and regulations, such as regulations of the U.S. Department of State (the “DOS”), the U.S. Department of Transportation, or their counterpart organizations in foreign countries regarding the operation of aircraft for public transportation of passengers and property. As discussed below, however, we are subject to government regulation in a number of respects. In addition, our lessees are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they are registered or operate. These laws govern, among other things, the registration, operation, maintenance, and condition of the aircraft.
Table of Contents
We are required to register our aircraft with an aviation authority mutually agreed upon with our lessee. Each aircraft registered to fly must have a Certificate of Airworthiness, which is a certificate demonstrating the aircraft’s compliance with applicable government rules and regulations and that the aircraft is considered airworthy. Each airline we lease to must have a valid operation certificate to operate our aircraft. Our lessees are obligated to maintain the Certificates of Airworthiness for the aircraft they lease.
Our involvement with the civil aviation authorities of foreign jurisdictions consists largely of requests to register and deregister our aircraft on those countries’ registries.
We are also subject to the regulatory authority of the DOS and the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “DOC”) to the extent such authority relates to the export of aircraft for lease and sale to foreign entities and the export of parts to be installed on our aircraft. We may be required to obtain export licenses for parts installed in aircraft exported to foreign countries. The DOC and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (through its Office of Foreign Assets Control, or “OFAC”) impose restrictions on the operation of U.S.-made goods, such as aircraft and engines, in sanctioned countries, as well as on the ability of U.S. companies to conduct business with entities in those countries and with other entities or individuals subject to blocking orders. The U.S. Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) prohibits financial transactions by U.S. persons, including U.S. individuals, entities, and charitable organizations, with individuals and organizations designated as terrorists and terrorist supporters by the U.S. Secretary of State or the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, enforces regulations related to the import of aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and the importation of parts into the U.S. for installation.
Jurisdictions in which aircraft are registered as well as jurisdictions in which they operate may impose regulations relating to noise and emission standards. In addition, most countries’ aviation laws require aircraft to be maintained under an approved maintenance program with defined procedures and intervals for inspection, maintenance and repair. To the extent that aircraft are not subject to a lease or a lessee is not in compliance, we are required to comply with such requirements, possibly at our own expense.
