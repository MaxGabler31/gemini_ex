Item 1. | Business.


(a) General Development of Business 

General

Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside of the United States of America. We are building our future on smoke-free products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes.  Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. Our vision is that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers, society, our company and our shareholders. 
Our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro, the world’s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 35% of our total 2017 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament. Our other leading international cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&M, Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 75% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2017. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe, Sampoerna A and Sampoerna U in Indonesia; Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines; Belmont and Canadian Classics in Canada; and Delicados in Mexico. While there are a number of markets where local brands remain important, international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets. 
In addition to our leading cigarette brand portfolio, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes. Reduced-risk products ("RRPs") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.  We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.  Because our RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke. 
Our leading RRP brand, IQOS, is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. We market our heated tobacco units under the brand names HEETS, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO, defined collectively as HEETS, as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks. IQOS was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan in 2014. To date, IQOS is available for sale in key cities in 37 markets and nationwide in Japan. 
Source of Funds — Dividends

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock. 
(b) Financial Information About Segments 

For all periods presented in this report, we divided our markets into four geographic regions, which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes: 


• | The European Union (“EU”) Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the EU countries and also comprises Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the EU through trade agreements; 


• | The Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EEMA”) Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and includes Eastern Europe, certain Balkan countries, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa and our international duty free business;


• | The Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and covers all other Asian markets as well as Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands; and

 1


• | The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.

Net revenues and operating companies income* (together with a reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 8") in Note 12. Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements. See Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our operating results by business segment.

The relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:


 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
European Union | 32.0 | % | | 35.8 | % | 32.6 | %
Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa | 24.4 | | | 27.1 | | 31.2 | 
Asia | 35.1 | | | 28.7 | | 26.3 | 
Latin America & Canada | 8.5 | | | 8.4 | | 9.9 | 
 | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

______________________________

* | For all periods presented in this report, our management evaluated segment performance and allocated resources based on operating companies income, which we define as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, plus equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

We use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). We often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments, and, in those circumstances, we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products. Our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs, as well as the cost of the IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.
Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.

To provide a greater focus on both parts of our business -- combustible and reduced-risk products -- and to support our transformation toward a smoke-free future, effective January 1, 2018, we began managing our business in six reportable segments as follows: 

• | The European Union Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland and covers all the European Union countries and also Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the European Union through trade agreements;


• | The Eastern Europe Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and includes Southeast Europe, Central Asia, Ukraine, Israel and Russia;


• | The Middle East & Africa Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and covers the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey and our international duty free business;


• | The South & Southeast Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and includes Indonesia, the Philippines and other markets in this region;


• | The East Asia & Australia Region is also headquartered in Hong Kong and includes Australia, Japan, South Korea, the People's Republic of China and other markets in this region, as well as Malaysia and Singapore; and


• | The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.

(c) Narrative Description of Business 

Our total shipments, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, decreased by 2.7% in 2017 to 798.2 billion units. We estimate that international industry volumes, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, were approximately 5.2 trillion units in 2017, a 1.3% decrease over 2016. Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that the international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 2.8 trillion units in 2017, a 2.8% decrease over 2016. We estimate that our reported share of the international market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States of America) was approximately 15.2% in 2017, 15.5% in 2016 and 15.6% in 2015. Excluding the PRC, we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 28.0%, 28.1%, and 28.6% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Shipments of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro, decreased by 4.0% in 2017 and represented approximately 9.7% of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, in 2017, 9.6% in 2016 and 9.6% in 2015. 

We have a market share of at least 15% and, in a number of instances, substantially more than 15%, in approximately 100 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. 

Heated tobacco units is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our HEETS, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO, defined collectively as HEETS, as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks. Total shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 36.2 billion units in 2017, up from 7.4 billion units in 2016. 
References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares in this Form 10-K are our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources.
Distribution & Sales 
Our main types of distribution are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously: 


• | Direct sales and distribution, where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers (including gas stations and other key accounts);


• | Distribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market;


• | Exclusive zonified distribution, where the distributors are dedicated to us in tobacco products distribution and assigned to exclusive territories within a market;


• | Distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade; and


• | Our own brand retail and e-commerce infrastructures for our RRP products and accessories.

Competition    

We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. Our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro, L&M, Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield, which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell IQOS devices and heated tobacco units. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.

 Procurement and Raw Materials    

We purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. We also contract directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Poland. In 2017, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 22% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, Philippines, Turkey and the United States.
We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.
In addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 450 suppliers. In 2017, our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 50% of our total direct materials purchases. The three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business.
The adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our IQOS devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. Our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs. 
Our IQOS devices are subject to product warranties, which are described in more detail in Item 8. Note 5. Product Warranty to our consolidated financial statements. We discuss our RRP products in more detail in Item 7. Business Environment—Reduced Risk Products. 
 Business Environment 
Information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in Item 7, Business Environment.

Other Matters

Customers 

None of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
Employees 
 
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 80,600 people worldwide, including full time, temporary and part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are excellent.

Executive Officers of the Registrant     
The disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth under the heading “Executive Officers as of February 9, 2018” in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 10").

Research and Development 

Our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation, which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore, we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct preferences. Four RRP platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness. We describe each of them in more detail in Item 7, Business Environment—Reduced-Risk Products.
The research and development expense for our RRP portfolio accounted for 74%, 72% and 70% of our total research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is set forth in Item 8, Note 14. Additional Information to the consolidated financial statements. 
Intellectual Property 
Our trademarks are valuable assets, and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including Marlboro, or have the right to use them in all countries where we use them.

In addition, we have more than 7,800 granted patents worldwide and approximately 7,700 pending patent applications. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs, as well as unregistered proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other unregistered intellectual property rights.

Effective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”). The Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:


• | PMI owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and


• | PM USA owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.

Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and resulting patents based solely on the jointly funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else.

The Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions concerning intellectual property that is independently developed by us or PM USA following March 28, 2008, the date of the spin-off from Altria Group, Inc. For ten years following that date, independently developed intellectual property may be subject to rights under certain circumstances that would allow either us or PM USA a priority position to obtain the rights to the new intellectual property from the other party, with the price and other commercial terms to be negotiated.
In the event of a dispute between us and PM USA under the Intellectual Property Agreement, we have agreed with PM USA to submit the dispute first to negotiation between our and PM USA’s senior executives and then to binding arbitration.
Seasonality 

Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism.

Environmental Regulation    

We are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint and wastage as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly, the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of climate change. We have developed and implemented a consistent environmental and occupational health, safety and security management system ("EHSS"), which involves policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. We also conduct regular safety assessments at our offices, warehouses and car fleet organizations. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of our EHSS management system at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards for safety and environmental management. The environmental performance data we report externally is also verified by a qualified third party. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on the management and controls we have in place and our review of climate change risks (both physical and regulatory), environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.
