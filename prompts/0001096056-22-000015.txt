We have a global presence, operating 13 manufacturing plants in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and China, one of which relates to discontinued operations, and we also have a joint venture in Japan. We employ approximately 1,400 people, including temporary staff, of which fewer than 100 relate to discontinued operations. In 2021, our net sales from continuing operations were $374.1 million (2020: $324.8 million, 2019: $373.4 million), and our net income from continuing operations was $30.0 million (2020: $20.8 million, 2019: $8.7 million).
Luxfer operates in two business segments - Elektron and Gas Cylinders.
Elektron Segment
Our Elektron Segment focuses on specialty materials based primarily on magnesium and zirconium. In 2021, sales from our Elektron Segment represented approximately 52% (2020: 56%, 2019: 59%) of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. Our top ten customers represented 37% of segment sales. No singular customer represented 10% or more of our Elektron Segment sales.
Key product lines include: 
•Advanced lightweight, corrosion-resistant and heat- and flame-resistant magnesium alloys for use in aerospace, healthcare and oil and gas applications.
•Magnesium powders used in countermeasure flares that protect aircrafts from heat-seeking missiles and also for heating pads for self-heating meals used by the military and emergency-relief agencies.
•High-performance zirconium-based materials and oxides used as catalysts and in the manufacture of advanced ceramics, fiber-optic fuel cells, pharmaceuticals and many other performance products. 
•Magnesium, copper, and zinc photoengraving plates for graphic arts and luxury packaging. 
Gas Cylinders Segment
Our Gas Cylinders Segment manufactures and markets specialized, highly-engineered cylinders using carbon composites and aluminum alloys. In 2021, sales from our Gas Cylinders Segment represented approximately 48% (2020: 44%, 2019: 41%) of our consolidated net sales. Our top ten customers represented 49% of segment sales. One customer represented 15% and another represented 11% of our Gas Cylinders Segment sales. No other singular customer represented greater than 10% of Gas Cylinders Segment sales.
Key product lines include:
•Carbon composite cylinders for compressed natural gas (CNG) and hydrogen containment in alternative fuel (AF) vehicles. 
•Carbon composite cylinders for self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), used by firefighters and other emergency-responders. Our products are also used by scuba divers and personnel in potentially hazardous environments, such as mines.
•Cylinders used for the containment of oxygen and other medical gases used by patients, healthcare facilities and laboratories.
Our U.S. aluminum gas cylinder business was sold in March 2021, our Superform U.K. business was sold in September 2021, and we expect our Superform U.S. business to be sold within the next twelve months. As a result, only our Superform U.S. business is still held on the balance sheet as held-for-sale at December 31, 2021.
All information included within this section relates to continuing operations, unless otherwise stated.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
See Note 17 ("Segment Information") to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our operating segments and our geographic areas.
Suppliers and raw materials
Post COVID economic recovery related raw material supply constraints and cost increases
The significant increase in demand for materials, transport and energy experienced as a result of the post-pandemic economic recovery has resulted in significant constraints on availability of key inputs, such as magnesium, aluminum and carbon fiber, and a consequent spike in prices. In addition, two critical suppliers of key inputs to the Elektron Segment declared force majeure during the year, which is a standard clause in contracts to remove liability for unexpected and unavoidable catastrophes that interrupt the normal course of business and prevent participants from fulfilling contractual obligations. In order to reduce the risk of interruption to production, we have sourced critical materials from alternative sources and built additional raw material inventory throughout the second half of 2021. We aim to pass through inflation to customers and, where possible, protect long term margins. However, we do experience timing differences that can impact short term profitability.
Elektron Segment
Key raw materials used by our Elektron Segment are magnesium, zircon sand and rare earths.
The world demand for magnesium is around one million metric tons per year. China provides about 80% of the world supply. Western production is, however, significant, from North American suppliers, Dead Sea Magnesium in Israel, RIMA Industrial in Brazil and two smelters in Russia. We purchase approximately 40% of our magnesium needs from China. We use only U.S.-sourced materials for our products sold to the U.S. military, for which U.S. sourcing is mandatory. 
We generally purchase raw materials from suppliers on a spot basis under standard terms and conditions. We have long-term supply contracts in place with U.S. Magnesium for raw material purchases of magnesium ingot for both military and commercial applications. The military contract covers magnesium purchases through December 31, 2023, whereas the commercial contract covers purchases through December 31, 2022.
We purchase and process zircon sand, which is found in heavy-minerals sand, titanium dioxide and other products. Global production of zircon is estimated at approximately 1.5 million metric tons. We source premium-grade zircon sand from suppliers in South Africa and Australia. We also purchase intermediate zirconium chemicals from suppliers in China. The level of these purchases is based on a number of factors, including required properties and relative market prices.
There are 17 rare earth metals that are reasonably common in nature. Usually found mixed together with other mineral deposits, these rare earths have magnetic and light-emitting properties that make them invaluable to high-technology manufacturers. These are ingredients in our zirconium chemical and magnesium alloy products, with our main requirement is for cerium, which we use in automotive catalysis compounds because of its unique oxygen-storage capabilities.
Gas Cylinders Segment
Key raw materials used in the Gas Cylinders Segment are high-strength carbon fiber and aluminum. Our main carbon fiber suppliers are Toray and Mitsubishi. In recent years, carbon fiber shortages have occurred due to increased demand for commercial aerospace and military applications. Over time, we have built relationships with our suppliers, providing them predictable requirements and annual contracts to ensure successful procurement of our required volume of carbon fiber.
In 2021, we purchased approximately 60% of our aluminum from Rio Tinto Alcan and its associated companies, and aluminum represented approximately 40% of the segment's raw material costs in the year. The price of aluminum has been somewhat volatile in the past. While we pass on most price movements to our customers, sometimes through contractual cost-sharing formulas, doing so can be more difficult or time consuming with our higher-value products.

Seasonality
Historically, we have shutdown periods at most of our manufacturing sites, during which we carry out maintenance work. Shutdowns typically last two weeks in the summer and one to two weeks around the year-end holidays, resulting in reduced levels of activity in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Third-quarter and fourth-quarter sales and operating profit can be affected by our own shutdowns and by shutdowns by various industrial customers. In particular, we have found that our fourth-quarter results are generally lower, since many customers reduce production activity from late November through December. However, due to shutdowns at both Luxfer and customer plants in the first half of 2020, we did not see this similar trend in the prior year, with results improving during the latter months as demand increased after the initial lockdowns enforced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also operate in various geographic areas that are susceptible to bad weather during winter months, such as Calgary, Canada, and various U.S. eastern states. Bad weather can unexpectedly disrupt production and shipments from our manufacturing facilities, which can lead to reduced revenue and operating profits. Additionally, we manufacture products that are used in graphic arts and premium packaging, demand for which increases in the run up to the year-end holidays.
Research and Development
Luxfer recognizes the importance of research in materials science and the need to develop innovative new products to meet future needs of customers and to continue providing growth opportunities for the business. Each year, we invest in the development of new products and processes directed towards transportation, defense and emergency response, healthcare and general industrial end-markets. Our product development projects also include utilizing skills of our wider commercial technical sales staff, manufacturing engineers and general management, many of whom are highly qualified scientists and engineers. A large proportion of senior sales and management time is spent overseeing development of products and working with customers on integrating our products and solutions into their product designs.
To provide customers with improving products and services, we invest in new technology and research and employ some of the world's leading specialists in materials science and metallurgy. Our engineers and metallurgists collaborate closely with our customers to design, develop and manufacture our products. We also co-sponsor ongoing research programs at major universities in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Thanks to the ingenuity of our own research and development teams, Luxfer has developed a steady stream of new products, most recently including:

This commitment reflects our strategy of focusing on high-performance, value-added product lines and markets and leveraging our collaboration with universities. We invest in developing products for end-markets that we believe have long-term growth potential. 
Intellectual Property
Luxfer relies on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and proprietary manufacturing processes and design rights, together with non-disclosure agreements and technical measures, to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products. Our Elektron Segment holds key patents related to protected applications, including numerous aerospace alloys and magnesium-gadolinium alloys, as well as patents related to environmental applications, including water-treatment products and our specialized G4 process used to manufacture zirconium-cerium oxides for emissions-control catalysts. The Elektron Segment also has patented technology for magnesium-based flameless heater pads used to heat meals and beverages. Key patents held by our Gas Cylinders Segment relate to composites and alloys for pressurized hollow bodies. No individual patent or such intellectual property is considered material to either the Elektron or Gas Cylinders Segment.
In certain areas, we rely more heavily upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how than patent protection in order to establish and maintain our competitive advantage. We generally enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and subcontractors, as well as our customers and vendors.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 1,400 people worldwide, including fewer than 100 individuals that relate to our discontinued operations. Of the approximately 1,300 employees related to our continuing operations, around 700 are employed in the United States.
To succeed in an ever-changing and competitive labor market, we have developed human capital management strategies, objectives, and measures that drive recruitment and retention, support business performance, advance innovation, foster employee development, and support our mission and values. Luxfer’s approach to human capital management is focused on the following programs and initiatives: (i) supporting financial, health, and social well-being; (ii) promoting a diverse and supportive workplace; (iii) ensuring occupational health and safety; and (iv) creating opportunities for growth and talent development. 
Financial, Health, and Social Well-Being
The Company’s compensation philosophy aims to attract, retain, and motivate employees through its incentive and benefit programs.

To ensure effective teamwork and achievement of common business goals, all Luxfer personnel are required to complete a variety of anti-harassment, non-discrimination, diversity, and unconscious bias trainings annually. Luxfer’s talent acquisition teams and hiring managers undergo additional training to ensure that a diverse slate of candidates is considered for all job openings. Further, Luxfer monitors the composition of its current workforce for diversity, age, and gender demographics. The quality of this data is continually improved to ensure that a diverse and talented workforce is maintained. This data is used to enhance employment and recruitment practices to provide the most inclusive work environment possible. 
Occupational Health and Safety
The occupational health and safety of employees is fundamental to delivering sustainable economic performance. Luxfer has established well-defined health and safety policies and procedures, as well as ongoing employee training, as part of the Company’s commitment to being an industry leader in safety. Gap analyses are regularly conducted and safety goals and objectives for all functional business units are developed. As part of the Company’s enterprise-wide risk management system, these objectives are monitored, and performance related to them is regularly reviewed and discussed. Employees are encouraged to submit suggestions, ideas, and observations about safety hazards which are incorporated into a “safety moment” at the beginning of each meeting to increase awareness and reinforce positive safety behavior. Additional efforts include monthly safety meetings with employees, safety audits by management, safety audits by certain employees, and the inclusion of safety initiatives as part of select employees’ incentive plans. The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include Lost Time Accidents (“LTAs”) and the recordable Incident Frequency Rate (“IFR”). Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near miss events and safety concerns identified. Reported total workforce numbers include employees and supervised contractors. In fiscal year 2021, the Company had 3 LTAs and an IFR of 2.62, with no work-related fatalities. 
Growth and Talent Development
One of Luxfer’s core values is ‘Personal Development’ because we are only as strong as our employees who achieve, lead, and revolutionize our business. We believe in each employee’s ability to bring their unique skills and passions into the challenging and constantly evolving industries we serve, providing an environment to grow, build relationships, and take advantage of career opportunities. Employees are provided training, learning, and development opportunities at all levels of the Company. At the management level, the Management and Executive Development program focuses on individual strengths and fosters technical skills and knowledge to create the next generation of well-rounded Luxfer leaders. With a multi-faceted curriculum, the program provides critical problem-solving, business management, and leadership skills necessary for Luxfer’s continued success. At the workforce level, management teams work closely with employees to ensure that they have the skills, knowledge, experience, and support necessary to accomplish their goals. Management utilizes a variety of tools to evaluate employee performance, including skill assessments, self-evaluations, and achievement of personal objectives. Personal objectives (a list of goals the employee will strive to achieve) are set at the beginning of each year in the form of a balanced scorecard. Managers approve the personal objective scorecard and review the employee’s performance in relation to their scorecard throughout the year. Setting personal objectives gets employees involved with the Company’s overall strategy and improves engagement, thereby supporting Luxfer’s growth and profitability.
