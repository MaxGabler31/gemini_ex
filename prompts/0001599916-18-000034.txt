This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures.

Business Plan
 
The Company is a blank check shell company. The Company’s plan is solely to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company.
 
Photozou Holdings, Inc.’s mailing address is 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan. The Company has a telephone number of +81-3-6303-9988. We neither rent nor own any properties. Until we pursue a viable business opportunity and recognize income, we will not seek office space.
 
The Company conducted a "Blank Check" offering subject to Rule 419 of Regulation C, pursuant to our S-1 deemed effective on June 20, 2017, as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "S.E.C.") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The offering proceeds and the securities to be issued to investors are deposited in an account (non-interest bearing) (the "Deposited Funds" and "Deposited Securities," respectively). While held in the escrow account, the deposited securities were not and have not been traded or transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), or Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or the rules thereunder. 10 percent of the offering proceeds are available to, exclusive of interest or dividends, as those proceeds are deposited into the escrow account. Except for this amount, the deposited funds and the deposited securities may not be released until an acquisition meeting certain specified criteria has been consummated and sufficient investors reconfirm their investment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 419 so that the remaining funds are adequate to allow the acquisition to be consummated. It is a requirement under Rule 419(e) of the Securities Act that the net assets or fair market value of any business to be acquired must represent at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds. This acquisition may be consummated using proceeds of this offering, loans or equity. Pursuant to these procedures, this prospectus, which describes an acquisition candidate and its business and includes audited financial statements, will be delivered to all investors. The Company must return the pro rata portion of the deposited funds to any investor who does not elect to remain an investor. Unless sufficient investors elect to remain investors so that the remaining funds are adequate to allow the acquisition to be consummated, all investors will be entitled to the return of a pro rata portion of the deposited funds (minus up to 10% which may be release to the registrant) and none of the deposited securities will be issued to investors. The pro rata portion to be received by investors will not include the 10% of proceeds which may be released to the company.

Pursuant to our aforementioned offering, we, “the Company,” sold a total of 3,037,300 shares of our common stock. The proceeds totaled $75,933. 

Currently, shareholders are being asked to reconfirm their investment given the proposed acquisition candidate. Prior to any reconfirmation vote our pending POS AM will need to gain effectiveness with the SEC.

Acquisition Candidate

On December 18, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Koichi Ishizuka, our President, CEO, Director and majority owner. At the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement (which is contingent upon a 80% reconfirmation vote under Rule 419), Koichi Ishizuka will transfer to the Company, 10,000 shares of the common stock of Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“Photozou Koukoku”), which represents all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 6,900,000 JPY ($60,766 USD translated by the exchange rate as of December 11, 2017) and the Company will gain a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Photozou Koukoku’s common stock and Photozou Koukoku will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and Photozou Koukoku were under common control.

Photozou Koukoku deals mainly in high-class digital single lens reflex cameras produced by famous Japanese camera makers, e.g. Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, etc. The used camera industry in Japan is a multi billion dollar industry and cameras made in Japan have worldwide appeal and recognition. Photozou Koukoku believes that due to the high quality of cameras created by Japanese camera makers that these will be the most appealing products to offer to the Japanese market. However, should market trends shift and the demand for cameras of other companies see a surge in popularity then Photozou Koukoku may consider the possibility of acquiring and reselling cameras by other manufacturers.
