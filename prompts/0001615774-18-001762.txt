Business Overview
 
Tonix is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing pharmaceutical products to treat serious neuropsychiatric conditions and to improve biodefense through the development of potential medical counter-measures. Our most advanced drug development program is focused on delivering a safe and effective long-term treatment for PTSD. PTSD is characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates. We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of PTSD, other central nervous system disorders and biodefense. In September 2016, we discontinued our fibromyalgia program in order to fully focus our resources on our PTSD program.

In June 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, conditionally accepted the proposed trade name Tonmya for TNX-102 SL, for the treatment of PTSD. The FDA’s final approval of Tonmya as a name for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD is subject to a, New Drug Application, or NDA, approval. A request for review of Tonmya as the proposed name for TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia has been withdrawn at the FDA. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, has granted the federal registration of the Tonmya mark.
 
Our lead product candidate, Tonmya, or TNX-102 SL, a proprietary low-dose cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, sublingual tablet, designed for bedtime administration, is in Phase 3 development as a potential treatment for PTSD. TNX-102 SL is also being developed as a treatment for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease, or AAD. Our development pipeline includes: TNX-601 (tianeptine oxalate), a separate pre-Investigational New Drug, or pre-IND, candidate designed for daytime administration as a potential treatment of PTSD and for cognitive dysfunction associated with steroid use; TNX-801, a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of horsepox virus, or HPXV; TNX-301, an IND candidate for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, or AUD; and TNX-701, a biodefense development program for protection from radiation injury. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
 
Tonmya – Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
 
Tonmya is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP for sublingual administration. Tonmya employs a proprietary, Protectic™ protective eutectic formulation of CBP which enables rapid systemic exposure and increased bioavailability through transmucosal absorption. We are developing Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD under an effective Investigational New Drug application, or IND, cleared by the FDA in June 2014. Tonmya for PTSD was designated Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA in December 2016.
 
An estimated 8.6 million adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by hyperarousal, avoidance, emotional numbing, and sleep disturbances. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD. Antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use. Antianxiety drugs, also called anxiolytics, are not approved for PTSD, but are commonly prescribed despite the recommendations against their use by many experts. Anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics are comprised of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs, which carry risks of tolerance and addiction and are also associated with potential serious side-effects, such as retrograde amnesia.
 
TNX-102 SL – Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer’s disease and held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in November 2017. We expect to file an IND to support a Phase 2 efficacy study in March 2018.
 
An estimated 5.3 million people in the U.S suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, with more than half that number expected to be affected by agitation. Behavioral symptoms are a major clinical complication of Alzheimer’s disease. Sleep disturbances and agitation are common and co-morbid features of Alzheimer’s disease. Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant negative consequences for both patients as well as their caregivers. Development of agitation, or its worsening, is one of the most common reasons for patients having to transition to nursing homes and other long-term care settings. Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for behavioral symptoms such as agitation and aggression which adversely affect the quality of life of both the patients and caregivers. Off-label use of atypical anti-psychotic medications for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease is a common practice, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and significant risks associated with their use in this population.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The principal components of our strategy are to:
 

● | Develop Tonmya for PTSD and TNX-102 SL for Other Indications. We currently are focusing on the development of Tonmya for PTSD. Our broader development strategy is to leverage the patented formulation to explore the clinical potential of TNX-102 SL in multiple other central nervous system disorders or neuropsychiatric conditions, including agitation in Alzheimer’s, that are either underserved by currently approved medications or have no approved treatment which represent large unmet medical needs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize the commercial potential of Tonmya. We plan to commercialize Tonmya for PTSD, either on our own or through collaboration with partners. We believe Tonmya can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage. An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas. If we determine that such a strategy would be more favorable than developing our own sales capabilities, we would seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of Tonmya;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates. We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution. In the cases of Tonmya and TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties. We plan to opportunistically apply for new patents to protect TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates; 
● | Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates. We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors. In the case of Tonmya, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy. We plan to continue these activities in tandem with our clinical development of Tonmya and to conduct similar work in relation to our other product candidates as they advance in their development; and 
● | Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates. We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates. For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep. 

Disease and Market Overview
 
Our product candidates address disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies or have no approved treatment which represent large potential commercial market opportunities. Background information on the disorders and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates is set forth below.
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
 
PTSD is a chronic condition that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death. The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Of those who experience significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians. As of 2012, there were approximately 638,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA. Based on March 2015 VHA data, more than 19% of military veterans involved in recent conflicts were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.

The medications currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings. Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge. Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and many have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.
 
Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
Alzheimer’s is a chronic neurodegenerative disease in which behavioral symptoms are a major clinical complication. Sleep disturbances and agitation are common and co-morbid features of Alzheimer’s disease. Agitation, which includes emotional lability, restlessness, irritability, and aggression, is one of the most distressing and debilitating of these behavioral complications of Alzheimer’s disease. Agitation is likely to affect more than half of the 5.3 million Americans who currently suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, and this number is expected to nearly triple by 2050. The presence of agitation nearly doubles the cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and agitation is estimated to account for more than 12 percent of the $256 billion in healthcare and societal cost of associated with Alzheimer’s disease for the year 2017 in the United States.
 
Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant negative consequences for both patients as well as their caregivers. Development of agitation, or its worsening, is one of the most common reasons for patients having to transition to nursing homes and other long-term care settings. Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for behavioral symptoms such as agitation and aggression which affects the quality of life of both the patients and caregivers.
 
Off-label use of atypical anti-psychotic medications for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease is a common practice, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and significant risks associated with their use in this population.
 
Our Product Candidates 
 
We currently are focused on developing a portfolio of product candidates, including one product candidate in clinical development for registration in two indications. We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies. The following table summarizes our most advanced product candidates, for which we plan to complete the required clinical studies to support their NDA filings:

Product Candidate | Indication | Stage of Development | Commercialization Rights
------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------
Tonmya | Posttraumatic stress disorder | Phase 3 | Worldwide 
TNX-102 SL | Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease | Pre-IND | Worldwide 

Tonmya
 
Overview
 
Tonmya or TNX-102 SL is a proprietary sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation. We are developing Tonmya for PTSD. We own all rights to Tonmya in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization. Excipients used in Tonmya are approved for pharmaceutical use. Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.
 
6


The current Tonmya sublingual tablets contain 2.8 mg of CBP. For the treatment of PTSD, Tonmya, 5.6 mg (two 2.8 mg tablets) administered simultaneously at bedtime, is in Phase 3 development. We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
 
The active ingredient in Tonmya, is CBP, a serotonin-2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, Tonmya acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for PTSD, including the serotonin 2A, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H-1 receptors.
 
CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: FLEXERIL® (5 mg and 10 mg oral immediate-release, or IR, tablet) and AMRIX® (15 mg and 30 mg oral extended-release capsule). The FLEXERIL brand of CBP IR tablet has been discontinued since May 2013. There are numerous generic versions of CBP IR tablets on the market. CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. IR CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment. Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day IR CBP tablets.
 
We designed Tonmya to be administered once-daily at bedtime and intended for long-term use. We believe the selected dose of Tonmya and its pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in PTSD. Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, Tonmya results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral IR CBP tablets. It also showed that the sublingual route of administration, which largely bypasses the “first pass” metabolism that swallowed medications undergo, results in a higher plasma ratio of CBP to its main active metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine. In clinical studies, Tonmya 2.8 mg and Tonmya 5.6 mg were generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported in these studies. Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after Tonmya administration.
 
We expect that any applications we submit to the FDA for approval of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for product candidates containing an active ingredient that is similar or identical to an already approved product. In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) NDA is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States. Currently, we are pursuing the development of Tonmya for PTSD, for which Tonmya is in Phase 3 development. We believe that Tonmya and TNX-102 SL have the potential to provide clinical benefit to this and possibly other CNS (central nervous system) indications that are underserved by currently marketed products or have no approved treatment.
 
On May 2, 2017, we were issued U.S. patent 9,636,408 “Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride”, which includes compositions of CBP and methods of manufacturing the eutectic. The Protectic™ protective eutectic and Angstro-Technology™ formulation claimed in the patent are important elements of our proprietary Tonmya or TNX-102 SL composition. The patent is expected to provide Tonmya or TNX-102 SL with U.S. market exclusivity until 2034. Eutectic tablets containing CBP and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability. A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal’s lattice. The distance between the molecular units is not changed. A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2034 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued.
 
On September 13, 2017, we were issued European patent 2,501,234 “Methods and Compositions for Treating Symptoms Associated with PTSD Using Cyclobenzaprine”. This patent recites the use of CBP for the treatment of PTSD, which covers the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD, since the active ingredient in Tonmya is CBP. The patent is expected to provide Tonmya with European market exclusivity until 2030 and may be extended based on the timing of the European marketing authorization of Tonmya for PTSD.

On December 15, 2017 we were issued Japanese Patent No. 6259452, “Compositions and Methods for Transmucosal Absorption,” by the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) relating to the pharmacokinetic profile of Tonmya, or TNX-102 SL.
 
On January 23, 2018, we were issued a Notice of Allowance from PTO for U.S. Patent Application 12/948,828, “Methods and compositions for treating symptoms associated with PTSD using Cyclobenzaprine”. This patent protects the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD as well as its active ingredient CBP for the treatment of PTSD. A Notice of Allowance signifies that we will be entitled to receive patent protection until 2030 in the U.S. for the allowed claims when the patent is issued. This method of use patent for Tonmya extends upon previously granted patents related to the composition of matter (U.S. Patent No. 9,636,408) and the active ingredient in Tonmya (European Patent No. 2,501,234) as described above.
 
On March 1, 2018, we received a Notice of Allowance from the JPO for Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-503239 “Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride The allowed claims recite pharmaceutical compositions comprising the eutectics and methods of manufacturing these eutectic formulations.
 
PTSD Program
 
We are developing Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD under an effective IND application. Tonmya for PTSD has been designated as Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA.
 
Clinical Development Plan
 
Phase 2 AtEase Study
 
In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 study of Tonmya in participants with military-related PTSD, which we refer to as the AtEase study. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using Tonmya to treat military-related PTSD at a dose of 2.8 mg or 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets). The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, or CAPS-5, between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo. The CAPS-5 scale is a standardized structured clinician interview and is considered the gold standard in clinical research and regulatory approval for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.
 
In the AtEase study, participants experienced their index trauma during military service in 2001 or later and had a baseline CAPS-5 score of 29 or higher, and were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to bedtime daily Tonmya 2.8 mg, Tonmya 5.6 mg, or placebo sublingual tablets for 12 weeks, respectively. The AtEase study was conducted at 24 U.S. centers and enrolled 231 participants in the modified intent-to-treat population. We reported topline results from the AtEase study in May 2016.
 
AtEase was adequately designed to evaluate whether a 2.8 mg dose would be efficacious, which would have provided an opportunity for this study to be used as one of the two pivotal efficacy studies required to support approval of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD. Although the 2.8 mg dose trended in the direction of a therapeutic effect, it did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. The 5.6 mg dose had a therapeutic effect as assessed by the CAPS-5 scale, which was statistically significant by MMRM with MI analysis (p-value = 0.031), even though this arm of the study, by design, included only approximately half the number of participants of the 2.8 mg and placebo arms. Tonmya demonstrated a dose-effect on multiple efficacy and safety measurements in the AtEase study.

In the AtEase study, Tonmya was well tolerated and the participant retention rate was 73% on placebo, 79% on Tonmya 2.8 mg and 84% on Tonmya 5.6 mg. Four distinct SAEs were reported in the study; three were in the placebo group, and one (proctitis/peri-rectal abscess) in the Tonmya arm, which was determined to be unrelated to Tonmya. The most common not dose-related adverse events were mild and transient local administration site conditions and of these oral hypoaesthesia, or numbness, was the most frequent and occurred in 39% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 36% of the participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 2% of the participants receiving placebo. Oral paresthesia, or tingling, occurred in 16% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 4% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 3% of the participants receiving placebo. Glossodynia, or a burning or stinging sensation in the mouth, occurred in 3% of participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose and 6% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose, compared to 1% of participants receiving placebo. Systemic adverse events that were potentially dose-related and occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose or placebo included: somnolence in 16% versus 6% of the participants receiving placebo; dry mouth in 16% versus 11% of the participants receiving placebo; headache in 12% versus 4% of the participants receiving placebo; insomnia in 6% versus 9% of the participants receiving placebo; sedation in 12% versus 1% of the participants receiving placebo; upper respiratory tract infection in 4% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo; abnormal dreams in 2% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo; and weight increase in 2% versus 5% of the participants receiving placebo. For the participants treated with the 2.8 mg dose, the incidence of the most common systemic adverse events reported above were less frequent than participants treated with the 5.6 mg dose with the exception of insomnia, which was 8%.
 
Retrospective analysis of the AtEase study suggested that the subset of participants with CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher at baseline (80% of AtEase population) was equivalent to the population of PTSD subjects studied in prior FDA registration studies of paroxetine and sertraline using older versions of the CAPS. The effect size (Cohen’s d) of the PTSD symptom improvement by CAPS-5 in this subset, comparing Tonmya 5.6 mg with placebo, was larger at 0.53 than the effect size in the full set with CAPS-5 score of 29 or higher at baseline at 0.36. To confirm this efficacy evidence, our ongoing Phase 3 program enrolls participants with baseline CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher. The beneficial effects of Tonmya 5.6 mg were preserved in the subgroup with PTSD from combat traumas (85% of AtEase population). Also, continuing remission (i.e. satisfying remission criterion of CAPS-5 score less than 11 at both week 8 and week 12) was observed in 21% of participants receiving a 5.6 mg dose of Tonmya as compared to 5% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.02, logistic regression). The AtEase study supported the hypothesized mechanism of sleep quality improvement, since additional retrospective analyses showed that in the CAPS-5 score of 33 or higher subset of participants, sleep improvement at week 4, measured by the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance instrument, predicted treatment response (by improvement in total CAPS-5 score without the sleep item) at week 12 in the Tonmya 5.6 mg group (p = 0.01, linear regression), whereas these measures were not related in placebo.
 
Open-label Extension Study for AtEase
 
Participants who completed the AtEase study were eligible to enroll into a 12-week open-label extension study with Tonmya 2.8 mg. We conducted this open-label extension study to obtain additional safety information from participants in the AtEase Study. The clinical phase of this open-label extension study is complete. Tonmya 2.8 mg was well tolerated for up to six months of treatment and no new safety signals were revealed in this open-label extension study.
 
Ongoing Phase 3 Honor Study
 
We have commenced the HONOR study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of Tonmya in approximately 550 participants with military-related PTSD in the first quarter of 2017. This study is an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study. The study design is very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study, except there will be one planned interim analysis, or IA, and the involvement of the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, to review unblinded IA results. The IDMC will make a recommendation to continue as planned, to continue but increase the number of recruited participants or to stop for success.  In addition, only one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) is being investigated and the entrance criterion is CAPS-5 ≥ 33 in this Phase 3 study. The IA will be conducted when approximately 50% (approximately 250 – 300 participants) of the initially planned participant enrollment is evaluable for efficacy. We received FDA acceptance of the Phase 3 HONOR study design in January of 2017. The HONOR study is being conducted at approximately 40 U.S. sites. As in the case of the AtEase study, the primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study is the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo.

Open-label Extension Study for HONOR
 
To obtain additional safety information from participants in the HONOR study, participants who completed the HONOR study are eligible to enroll into a 12-week open-label extension study with Tonmya 5.6 mg. This open-label extension study is ongoing.
 
Prospective Phase 3 Study
 
A second, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of Tonmya 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) in approximately 550 PTSD participants may follow, if necessary. We expect this study to be conducted at approximately 40 U.S. sites. As in the case of the HONOR and AtEase studies, the primary efficacy endpoint of this second Phase 3 study will be the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 scale between those treated with Tonmya and those receiving placebo.
Long-Term Safety Exposure Study for Tonmya 
 
In addition to the ongoing 12-week open-label extension study for HONOR, we plan to conduct the registration-required open-label extension studies of Tonmya in participants who complete either the 12-week open-label extension study of HONOR study or the second PTSD Phase 3 study. The goal of the open-label extension studies is to obtain adequate 6- and 12-month safety exposure data from Tonmya 5.6 mg to support its registration for the treatment of PTSD as it is a chronic psychiatric condition.
Regulatory Update
 
Subsequent to reporting the Phase 2 AtEase study topline result, we held an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in August 2016 to discuss the Phase 3 program required to support the registration of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD and the remaining data package for the NDA filing. As described below, the first Phase 3 stud, currently ongoing, is in participants with military-related PTSD and the second Phase 3 study, if needed, will be performed in participants suffering from PTSD.
 
In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD. The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was based on the preliminary clinical evidence of Tonmya 5.6 mg on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
 
Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA in about six months instead of 10 months after submission and rolling submission of completed portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA’s senior managers contributing significant guidance. The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our Breakthrough Therapy development program.
 
In March 2017, we held the Initial Cross-Disciplinary Breakthrough Therapy Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the opportunity to accelerate the development and submission of the Tonmya NDA for the treatment of PTSD. Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, a single-study NDA approval could be possible based on statistically persuasive topline data from the ongoing HONOR study. Additionally, due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of Tonmya, the FDA agreed that studies in assessing abuse and dependency potential of Tonmya are not required to support the Tonmya NDA filing.
 
In June 2017, the FDA conditionally accepted the proposed trade name Tonmya for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.
 
On September 7, 2017, we had a Breakthrough Therapy Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) guidance meeting with the FDA regarding the CMC data required to support the Tonmya NDA and commercial product. We received the FDA formal minutes from that meeting in October 2017 that reflect our readiness to manufacture Tonmya commercial product at production scale if an NDA can be submitted based on the HONOR study. This is critical to the successful launch of a potentially improved treatment option for PTSD patients, especially those with military-related PTSD. In principle, our proposed CMC data package to support Tonmya’s NDA approval and commercial manufacturing plans was acceptable to the FDA.

 Other NDA Requirements
 
An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or Agreed iPSP, is required for the initial NDA submission. We submitted a revised iPSP in the first quarter of 2017, which incorporated the FDA comments received on our iPSP submitted in the third quarter of 2016. Additional comments from the FDA were received in second quarter of 2017 on our revised iPSP. We plan to submit an Agreed iPSP in the third quarter of 2018. A Final Pediatric Study Plan requirement will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.
 
Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the Tonmya NDA filing. Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for PTSD and the long-term safety data (up to 15 months) on Tonmya 2.8 mg in a prior fibromyalgia program, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
 
Phase 1 Bioequivalence, Bridging PK, Food-Effect and Dose-Proportionality Studies
 
Completed Bioequivalence Study
 
We completed a Phase 1 bioequivalence study that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of a single-dose of Tonmya 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: (i) the facility used to produce Tonmya 2.8 mg tablets for the Phase 2 AtEase study; and (ii) the facility used to produce Tonmya 2.8.mg tablets for our clinical studies required to support the PTSD NDA submission and the to-be-marketed product. This bioequivalence study demonstrated that the Tonmya 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at these two facilities were bioequivalent, supporting the use of the AtEase study to support the Phase 3 studies.
Multi-dose Bridging PK Study
 
We intend to seek FDA marketing approval for Tonmya or TNX-102 SL pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA using AMRIX® extended-release or ER capsules (30 mg) as our reference listed drug, or RLD. As agreed upon by the FDA, we have started to study Tonmya 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) in comparison to AMRIX 30 mg ER capsules in a randomized, open-label, parallel, multiple-dose bridging PK study to provide a systemic exposure bridge.  If the Tonmya initial dose and at steady state exposures are less than or comparable to the RLD maximum approved dose (30 mg) and the metabolic profile is similar to AMRIX, the results of this study will provide the necessary systemic exposure bridge of Tonmya to AMRIX. The approval of Tonmya for PTSD NDA can thus rely on the safety findings (clinical and nonclinical) of the currently approved CBP drug products.
Food Effect and Dose-proportionality Studies
 
To support the Tonmya product registration, a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, food-effect, comparative bioavailability study of Tonmya following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions and a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, dose-proportionality, comparative bioavailability study of a single dose Tonmya 2.8 mg vs 5.6 mg in healthy subjects under fasting conditions will be completed for the Tonmya NDA submission.
Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Nonclinical Development
 
The FDA has accepted our proposed nonclinical data package to support our PTSD NDA filing. In October 2016, we completed the six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of the active ingredient, CBP, in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S., if necessary. These chronic toxicity studies were requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the AMRIX approved prescribing information, or labeling, which is necessary to support the Tonmya or TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use. Due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of Tonmya, the FDA agreed that nonclinical study to assess CBP abuse and dependency potential is not required to support the Tonmya NDA filing.

Manufacturing
 
TNX-102 SL drug product for Phase 2 was manufactured in a small-scale cGMP facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production. For the clinical trial materials for Phase 3 clinical and NDA required Phase 1 studies, and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA. The product’s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of the single-dose pharmacokinetic study. FDA has accepted our proposed CMC data package to support Tonmya’s NDA approval and commercial manufacturing plans, reflecting our readiness to manufacture Tonmya commercial product at production scale.
 
TNX 102 SL – Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
Regulatory Update
 
On November 6, 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed development of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. We received the formal minutes from that meeting in December 2017 that reflect that Tonix has the data needed to file an IND to support a Phase 2 study which can potentially be one of the pivotal efficacy studies. We plan to submit the TNX-102 SL IND for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease in March 2018.
Additional Product Candidates
 
We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including two pre-IND candidates, TNX-601, a daytime treatment for PTSD and TNX-801, a biologic vaccine product for the prevention of smallpox, as well as an IND candidate, TNX-301, a potential treatment for AUD.
 
TNX-601
 
TNX-601 is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate in the pre-IND stage of development for the treatment for PTSD. Currently there is no tianeptine-containing product approved in the U.S., but tianeptine sodium (amorphous) has been marketed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America for the treatment of depression since 1987. It is effective in various depressive states and also improves depression-associated anxiety and somatic complaints. We have discovered a novel oxalate salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine. Like CBP, tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants, but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties. Tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the neuroplastic changes that are observed during periods of stress and corticosteroid use. It is a weak mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, but does not have significant affinity for other known neurotransmitter receptors. Due to its decades of use in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, tianeptine has an established safety profile. In addition to being used to treat depression, several published studies support the potential of tianeptine as an effective and safe therapy for patients with PTSD. Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 is being developed for daytime usage as a first-line monotherapy for PTSD. Tianeptine’s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than Tonmya.
 
We intend to develop TNX-601 under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for PTSD and cognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use. Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 has been initiated.
 
TNX-801
 
TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a live synthetic version of horsepox virus, or HPXV, grown in cell culture. TNX-801 was synthesized by Professor David Evans and Dr. Ryan Noyce at the University of Alberta, Canada in collaboration with us. An article describing the work was published (Noyce RS, Lederman S, Evans DH (2018) Construction of an infectious horsepox virus vaccine from chemically synthesized DNA fragments. PLoS ONE 13(1): e0188453. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188453). HPXV has protective vaccine activity in mice, using a model of lethal vaccinia infection. Discussions regarding vaccine manufacturing activities have been initiated to support further nonclinical testing of TNX-801. We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for widespread immunization and for the U.S. strategic national stockpile. Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique virulence properties that we believe may suggest lower toxicity and potential safety advantages over existing vaccinia-based vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis.
 
12


 We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the most efficient and appropriate investigational plan, e.g., the application of the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, or Animal Rule, or conducting active comparator studies using ACAM2000, the current licensed live vaccinia virus vaccine, to establish the safety and effectiveness evidence to support the licensure TNX-801. In the 1970s, vaccination against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security. We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine. In addition, 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity is expected under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon receiving FDA licensure. However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023. If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed. We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND study. 
 
TNX-301
 
TNX-301 is a fixed-dose Combination Drug Product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline. We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations. A pre-IND meeting was held in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development program of TNX-301 for AUD. At that meeting, the FDA advised us of the nonclinical studies required for this CDP IND application to support the initiation of the first-in-man study with TNX-301. IND planning activities are underway.
 
TNX-701
 
We own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701. We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701. We plan to develop TNX-701 under the Animal Rule, which is applicable when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. We expect significant reduction in development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level. Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
 
The market for therapies to treat PTSD and other CNS conditions is well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies. GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil®) and Pfizer (Zoloft®) market FDA-approved drugs for PTSD. Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
 
13


 Certain other companies and institutions are known to be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Bionomics (BNC-201), Otsuka/Lundbeck (Rexulti® [brexpiprazole]), Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (riluzole), the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]). BNC-201 is in Phase 2 for PTSD and is an allosteric modulator of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Rexulti is in Phase 2 for PTSD and is an atypical antipsychotic. Riluzole is in a Phase 2 trial for active duty military members and veterans with PTSD and is a blocker of certain sodium channels and a modulator of the glutamatergic system. MDMA is Phase 3 ready for PTSD and is a DEA schedule 1 hallucinogen that is being studied for drug-assisted psychotherapy. MDMA was awarded Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in August 2017. Brainsway Ltd., a medical device company, is currently recruiting patients for a pivotal Phase 3 trial using a deep transcranial magnetic stimulation device for treatment of PTSD. A number of other companies and institutions have or may be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including: Aptinyx is developing NYX-783 which is in Phase I and targets the NMDA receptor, Mt. Sinai Hospital and Medical School in New York City is developing ketamine which is in Phase 2 and targets the NMDA receptor, Azevan Pharmaceuticals is developing SRX246 which is in Phase 2 and targets the vasopressin V1A receptor, University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is developing losartan which is in Phase 2 and is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) are developing oxytocin which is in Phase 2 and targets the oxytocin receptor. 
 
Several companies have clinical candidates for which PTSD is being considered as a secondary indication. Johnson and Johnson is developing CERC-501 which is in Phase 2 for depression, targeting the kappa opioid receptor, NeuroRx is developing NRX-101 which is in Phase 2 for bipolar depression and is a combination of ketamine, lurasidone, and d-cycloserine, Roche is developing RG7314 which is in Phase 2 for Autism, Rodin Therapeutics has a preclinical candidate for Alzheimer’s disease that targets histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2 gene product), SpringWorks Therapeutics is developing PF-04457845 which is in Phase 2 for osteoarthritis and targets fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).
 
In addition, approved medications that are used off-label for the treatment of PTSD include: anti-depressants, such as nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; and certain atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and risperidone.
 
 Additionally, a number of companies are developing prescription medicines for agitation in Alzheimer’s, including Otsuka/Lundbeck (Rexulti® or brexpiprazole), Avanir/Otsuka (deudextromethorphan), Axsome (dextromethorphan/buproprion) and InterCellular (lumateperone). Rexulti® has completed two pivotal studies in agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease. Deudextromethorphan is in Phase 3 for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. Dextromethorphan/buproprion is in Phase 3 for the treatment of resistant depression and agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Lumateperone is in Phase 3 for treating behavioral disturbances associated with dementia. 
 
Although a number of companies are marketing or developing prescription medicines for sleep disorders, including Merck & Co, Purdue Pharma, Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and Sage Therapeutics, none of these sleep disorders drugs are approved for PTSD or AAD. Merck is marketing Belsomra® (suvorexant), which is a dual orexin receptor anatomist indicated for insomnia. Purdue and Eisai are developing lemborexant and GlaxoSmithKline is developing SB-649868 which are also dual orexin receptor antagonists. Johnson & Johnson and Minerva Neurosciences are developing seltorexant which is a selective orexin-2 antagonist. Sage Therapeutics is developing SAGE-217 which is a neurosteroid derivative that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptors and was recently shown to increase sleep efficiency in a 5-hour phase advance model of insomnia.
 
Additionally, a number of companies are working on potential vaccines/treatments for smallpox, including Bavarian Nordic, SIGA Technologies and Chimerix. Bavarian Nordic is developing and has submitted an NDA for Imvamune® (or Modified Virus Ankara or MVA), which is a non-replicating vaccinia virus vaccine, which has been approved in other countries. SIGA is developing and has submitted an NDA for Arestvy®/TPOXX® (tecovirimat), which is an antiviral. Chimerix is developing brincidofovir (CMX001), which is an antiviral.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to Tonmya or TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to Tonmya or TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use. As of February 1, 2018, the patents we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to include eight issued U.S. patents and 87 issued non-U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing an additional 16 U.S. patent applications, of which three are provisional and 13 are non-provisional, three international patent applications, and 72 non-U.S./non-international patent applications.
 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 
Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the PTO in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.  
 
The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or methods of making or using that drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, is a federal law that encourages new drug research by restoring patent term lost to regulatory delays by permitting a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product or its methods of manufacture or use if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of an NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
 
The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our five most advanced product candidates as of March 1, 2018 are summarized below.
 
15


TNX-102 SL – Central Nervous System Conditions
 
Our patent portfolio for TNX-102 SL include patent applications directed to compositions of matter of CBP, formulations containing CBP, and methods for treating CNS conditions, such as Tonmya for PTSD, and TNX-102 SL for agitation in neurodegenerative conditions, e.g. agitation in Alzheimer’s disease, utilizing these compositions and formulations.
 
 Certain eutectic compositions were discovered by development partners and are termed the “Eutectic Technology.” The patent portfolio for Tonmya and TNX-102 SL relating to the Eutectic Technology includes patent applications directed to eutectic compositions containing CBP, eutectic CBP formulations, methods for treating PTSD and other CNS conditions utilizing eutectic CBP compositions and formulations, and methods of manufacturing eutectic CBP compositions. The Eutectic Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. patent applications, such as U.S. Patent Application No. 14/214,433. If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2034 or 2035, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
On March 10, 2017, we received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for the U.S. Patent Application No. 14/214,433 “Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride,” which includes compositions of CBP and methods of manufacturing the eutectic. The U.S. eutectic patent was issued on May 2, 2017 as U.S. Patent No. 9,636,408. The patent claims recite pharmaceutical compositions comprising the eutectic. The patent claims also recite methods of manufacturing the eutectic. Tablets containing CBP and mannitol eutectic have good pharmaceutical stability and manufacturability. A solid eutectic is a form of matter in which two solid crystals co-penetrate each other, such that the inter-molecular space between the units of one crystal lattice are occupied by the other crystal lattice. The distance between the molecular units is not changed.
 
The unique pharmacokinetic profile of Tonmya and TNX-102 SL, or the PK Technology, was discovered by Tonix and its development partners. The patent portfolio for Tonmya and TNX-102 SL relating to the PK Technology includes patent applications directed to compositions of matter of CBP, formulations containing CBP, methods for treating PTSD, agitation in neurodegenerative conditions, and other CNS conditions utilizing these compositions and formulations. The PK Technology patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent Application No. 13/918,692. If U.S. and non-U.S. patents claiming priority from those applications issue, those patents would expire in 2033, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
On September 13, 2017, we were issued European patent 2,501,234 “Methods and Compositions for Treating Symptoms Associated with PTSD Using Cyclobenzaprine”. This patent recites the use of CBP for the treatment of PTSD, which covers the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD, since the active ingredient in Tonmya is CBP. The patent is expected to provide Tonmya with European market exclusivity until 2030 and may be extended based on the timing of the European marketing authorization of Tonmya for PTSD.
 
On December 15, 2017 we were issued Japanese Patent No. 6259452, “Compositions and Methods for Transmucosal Absorption,” by the JPO relating to the pharmacokinetic profile of Tonmya or TNX-102 SL.
 
On January 17, 2018, we received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for the U.S. Patent Application No. 12/948,828 “Methods and Compositions for Treating Symptoms Associated with PTSD Using Cyclobenzaprine”. The allowed claims recite a method of using Tonmya’s active ingredient cyclobenzaprine to treat PTSD. The patent, when it issues is expected to provide Tonmya with US market exclusivity until 2030.
 
On March 1, 2018, we received a Notice of Allowance from the JPO for Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-503239 “Eutectic Formulations of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride The allowed claims recite pharmaceutical compositions comprising the eutectics and methods of manufacturing these eutectic formulations.

TNX-801 — Live HPXV Vaccine for Prevention of Smallpox
 
We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, TNX-801, a live HPXV that is being developed as a new smallpox preventing vaccine, we have patent applications directed to synthetic chimeric poxviruses and methods of using these poxviruses to protect individuals against smallpox. These applications include U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 15/802,189 and International Patent Application No. PCT/US2017/059782. We also own the rights to develop other vaccine candidates against smallpox. With respect to these vaccine candidates, we own U.S. Patent Application No. 14/207,727 and related intellectual property rights. The smallpox vaccine technologies relate to proprietary forms of live HPXV and vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease. We believe that this technology, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries. 
 
TNX-301 — Alcohol Use Disorders 
 
Our patent portfolio for disulfiram and selegiline combinations includes patents and patent applications. It includes claims directed to disulfiram and selegiline, pharmaceutical compositions containing disulfiram and selegiline, disulfiram and selegiline formulations, methods of treating AUD, and methods of modulating alcohol abuse and dependence. It includes issued U.S. Patent Nos. 8,093,300 and 8,481,599. The patent expiring last is expected to expire in 2024, excluding any patent term extensions.
TNX-701 — Radioprotection Biodefense Technology
 
We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, which is a potential radioprotective therapy. For protection of our intellectual property, we have not disclosed the identity of the new development candidate.
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.

Research and Development
 
We have approximately 9 employees dedicated to research and development. Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada. We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies.Manufacturing
 
We have contracted with third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturer organization, or CMOs, for the manufacture of Tonmya and TNX-102 SL drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing. For Tonmya and TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial. Our manufacturing operations are managed and controlled in Dublin, Ireland.
 
All of our small molecules drug candidates are synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.
 
Our smallpox-preventing vaccine candidate is a biologic and uses live form of HPXV. Both the drug substance (HPVX and the cell bank) and the drug product (vaccine) will be manufactured by contract cGMP-compliant facilities capable of manufacturing for nonclinical/clinical testing and licensed product.
 
Government Regulations
 
The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
 
23


The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA for drug products, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for biologic products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety. Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
 

● | Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
24



● | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations. Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
New Drug Applications
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product. An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA. The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.

Section 505(b) NDAs
 
There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for Tonmya for PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates. We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future. A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA’s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs. Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA. The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant’s drug and the reference drug. In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA. As such, we plan to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for Tonmya for PTSD. The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for PTSD as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. If the FDA determines that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA is not appropriate and that a full NDA is required for Tonmya, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for Tonmya could substantially and materially increase, and Tonmya might be less likely to be approved. If the FDA requires a full NDA for Tonmya, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted. If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for a safety reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated Tonmya 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
 
Patent Protections
 
An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug. With respect to every patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book, which is the FDA’s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
 
If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action. However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
 
Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.

Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market. The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety. This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period. However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7½ years after the NCE approval date. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation. Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria. They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed. FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation –Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:

● | intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
27


In December 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD. The Breakthrough Therapy designation request was submitted based on the preliminary clinical evidence of Tonmya on military-related PTSD in the AtEase study.
 
Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the eligibility for priority review of the NDA in about six months instead of 10 months after submission and rolling submission of completed portions of the NDA, in addition to an organizational commitment involving FDA’s senior managers contributing significant guidance. The FDA is committing to provide us timely advice and interactive communications related to the design and efficient execution of our Breakthrough Therapy development program.
 
Material Threat Medical Countermeasures
 
 In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation. One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at “Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.” The Act created a new priority review voucher program for “material threat medical countermeasures.” The Act defines such countermeasures as drugs or vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent. The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, and botulism. A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product application; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10-12 months to 6 months. The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it. We intend to seek a priority review voucher for TNX-801 licensure as a material threat medical countermeasure. However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023. If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed. 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:

● | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


● | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | drug sampling and distribution requirements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
 
28


The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our product candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both. The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 
29


In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
The Impact of New Legislation and Amendments to Existing Laws
 
 The FDCA is subject to routine legislative amendments with a broad range of downstream effects. In addition to new legislation, such as the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 or the FDASIA in 2012, Congress introduces amendments to reauthorize drug user fees and address emerging concerns every five years. We cannot predict the impact of these new legislative acts and their implementing regulations on our business. The programs established or to be established under the legislation may have adverse effects upon us, including increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. In addition, the FDA’s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Additionally, the current legislative authority for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act expired in September 2017. The requirements and changes imposed by the legislation to reauthorize the act may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
