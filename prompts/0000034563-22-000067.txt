Business Strategy
Overview
We are a coffee company dedicated to delivering the coffee people want, the way they want it. We build partnerships with customers who value quality, a wide array of services and sustainable sourcing and are passionate about delivering great coffee, tea, and culinary experiences to their communities.
In order to achieve our mission, we have grown existing capabilities and continue to develop new capabilities to deliver value to our customers. More recently, we have undertaken initiatives such as, but not limited to, the following:
•Executing Manufacturing and Network Optimization. We continue to develop and execute manufacturing network optimization. We utilize our Northlake, Texas, facility to improve production efficiencies and balance volume across our manufacturing and distribution networks to facilitate sustainable long-term growth. In fiscal 2021, we substantially increased the production and packaging capacity at our Northlake, Texas production facility which allowed us to exit our aged Houston, Texas facility. We also utilize our distribution center in Rialto, California, opened in fiscal 2021, which is geographically closer to many of our customers in the Western United States, and which enabled more efficient service to our West Coast network as well as the consolidation of certain branches in Southern California. We 
also continue to execute branch rationalization, which improves our cost structure without sacrificing service to our customers.
•Leveraging our Direct-Store-Delivery ("DSD") Network for growth. Our handheld technology helps drive productivity and customer service levels. This technology enhances our capabilities, including the ability to execute our pre-sell strategy. We have also recently expanded dedicated new business resources to capture market share. Additionally, we are focused on building partnerships that utilize our current distribution capabilities to expose us to industry and product innovation. 
•Product Innovation Pipeline. We are continuing to enhance our premium coffee and tea program, developing strategic partnerships, and building an advantaged allied product portfolio that resonates with our customers. We will continue to provide leadership in sustainable product solutions for our customers.
•Driving Customer Satisfaction. Providing our customers the products they want, when they want them, is key to customer satisfaction and retention. We have invested in systems and processes to improve our ability to service our customers. We are driving continuous improvement on “On-Time and In-Full” and other key service metrics. In addition, we are focused on optimizing our product commercialization process and bringing innovation to our customers.
•Service Excellence in Revive Service & Restoration ("Revive"). We continue to have one of the largest coffee service networks in the industry and are able to install, repair, and refurbish commercial brewing equipment. With Revive, we are focused on continually improving time-to-install and time-to-repair and restoration of equipment. We have successfully built partnerships with leading equipment manufacturers and are invested in training our team on the latest equipment offerings to enhance our service capabilities and value addition.
•Enhance Processes and Systems. We are implementing IT applications which we expect to enhance our e-commerce and supply chain optimization and flexibility. We are also continuing to invest in and enhance other IT capabilities to provide back-office support which will enable enhanced customer analytics, enable better product targeting, and create a more robust demand and supply process.
•OmniChannel Sales Capability. We are focused on increasing our presence with leading retailers, enhancing our e-commerce platform and developing distributor partnerships. We continue to refresh our current branded product websites to help build our on-line sales and enhance customer experience.
We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by providing coffee, tea, and culinary expertise, service excellence, and equipment program support. We tailor solutions to our customers' needs helping them deliver a great experience for their customers, which includes: 
•Offering a wide variety of sustainably sourced coffee, tea, and culinary products, thereby helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals and objectives;
•Providing consumer, channel, and market insights; including ideation to support customer menu and product evaluation in line with consumer trends;
•Delivering comprehensive commercial brewing equipment program support from installation to preventative maintenance to timely repair;
•Providing DSD service where our trained Route Sales Representative ("RSR") orders product to keep our customers in-stock, merchandises the beverage station, rotates products, cleans and inspects equipment on-site, and performs “cup quality checks” all to ensure a great experience for the consumer. Our services provided to DSD customers are conducted primarily in person through our RSRs, who develop business relationships with chefs, restaurant owners and food buyers at their delivery locations; and 
•Providing comprehensive coffee programs to our national account customers, including private brand development, green coffee procurement, hedging, category management, sustainable sourcing, limited time specialty products, packaging design and supply chain management.
Industry and Market Leadership
We have made the following investments in an effort to ensure we are well-positioned within the industry to take advantage of category trends, industry insights, and general coffee, tea and allied product knowledge to grow our business:
•Coffee Industry Leadership. Through our dedication to the craft of sourcing, blending and roasting coffee, and our participation and/or leadership positions with the Specialty Coffee Association ("SCA"), National Coffee Association, Coalition for Coffee Communities, International Women's Coffee Alliance, Pacific Coast Coffee Association, and Roasters Guild, we work to help shape the future of the coffee industry. We believe that due to our commitment to the industry, large retail and foodservice operators are drawn to working with us. We were among the first coffee roasters 
in the nation to receive SCA certification of a state-of-the-art coffee lab, which includes our product development labs at the Northlake, Texas and Portland, Oregon facilities. 
•Market Insight and Consumer Research. We have developed a market insight capability internally that reinforces our business-to-business positioning as a thought leader in the coffee, tea and food service industries. We invest in proprietary consumer and customer segmentation studies and provide trend insights and product development support that help our customers create winning products and integrated marketing strategies. We are focused on understanding key demographic groups and their attitudes and behaviors to better position the Company as a consumer brand at retail and e-commerce and expand these sales channels. 
Sustainability Leadership
•Sustainability. We believe that our collective efforts in measuring our social and environmental impact, creating programs for waste, water and energy reduction, promoting partnerships in our supply chain that aim at supply chain stability and food security, and focusing on employee engagement place us in a unique position to help retailers and foodservice operators create differentiated coffee and tea programs that can include sustainable supply chains, direct trade purchasing, training and technical assistance, recycling and composting networks, and packaging material reductions. During fiscal 2022 we were part of the 2021 CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard. This means that we were among the top 8% of participants for supplier engagement on climate change, based on our 2021 CDP disclosure. Further, in fiscal 2022, we published our annual sustainability report based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s comprehensive compliance standard. In addition, China Mist is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (the “ETP”), a non-profit organization that works to improve the sustainability of the tea sector, the lives of tea workers and farmers, and the environment in which tea is produced. As a member of the ETP, China Mist sources all of its tea from tea plantations that are certified, monitored, and regularly audited by the ETP.
•Science-Based Carbon Reduction Targets. We believe combating climate change is critical to the future of our company, the coffee industry, coffee growers and the world. In fiscal 2022 we made progress towards our science based carbon reduction targets. With a new baseline established in fiscal 2018, we set more ambitious goals in line with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Setting approved targets places us among those responsible businesses that are making measurable contributions to incorporate sustainability within their business strategy. 
•Zero Waste to Landfill. Achieving zero waste in our production and distribution facilities is a significant step in reaching our overall sustainability goals. In fiscal 2022 we maintained our goal of 90% waste diversion for our primary production and distribution facilities. To accomplish this goal, we have focused on the circularity of our waste streams, making partnerships to reuse them, reintroducing them as inputs for new products, or recycling them and composting them when none of the previous options are possible. Currently 77% of the waste generated company-wide is diverted from the landfill, and our roasting facilities have achieved the Zero Waste goal since 2018.
•LEED® Certified Facilities. Our Portland production and distribution facility is the first in the Northwest to achieve LEED® Silver Certification. Our corporate office in Northlake, Texas has also achieved LEED® Silver Certification.
•Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® Program. In fiscal 2022, we continued to grow our direct trade sourcing model, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®. This program involves direct long-term partnerships with coffee growing communities based on principles of sustainability, transparent pricing and consumer education. This model is an impact-based product or raw material sourcing framework that utilizes data-based sustainability metrics to influence an inclusive, collaborative approach to sustainability along the supply chain. To evaluate whether coffee is Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®, we follow an outcome-based evaluation framework. The result of this evaluation impacts where we invest our resources within our supply chain and has led to an increased level of transparency for us. Overall Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®  builds community partnerships for decision making, training, and reporting that benefits all members of the coffee supply chain.
•Green Coffee Traceability. We are committed to the inclusion of more sustainably-sourced coffees in our supply chain. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when customers, roasters and suppliers cannot see back into their supply chain. To address these concerns, as well as to deepen our commitment to the longevity of the coffee industry, we track traceability levels from all green coffee suppliers on a per-contract basis. This helps us to bring transparency to our supply chain, rank our suppliers, and also to identify opportunities to select trusted providers, cooperatives, mills, exporters, and other suppliers, when offering sustainable coffees to our customers. It also helps us deepen our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions generated upstream of our supply chain.
•Supplier Sustainability. We are committed to working with suppliers who share our social, environmental and economic sustainability goals. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when suppliers are not held to the same strict standards to which we hold ourselves. To address this concern, all existing suppliers and new suppliers must acknowledge and adhere to our Supplier Standards of Engagement. These Standards of Engagement are aligned with the United Nations Global Compact and set minimum standards for suppliers that are designed to provide Farmer Bros. visibility into all aspects of its supply chain and meets these objectives. Our suppliers also execute a Supplier's 
Certificate of Compliance, representing supplier's receipt and acknowledgment of the Standards of Engagement and agreement to comply with the same. 
Charitable Activities
We view charitable involvement as a part of our corporate responsibility and sustainability model: Social, Environmental, and Economic Development, or SEED. We endorse and support communities where our customers, employees, businesses, and suppliers are located, and who have enthusiastically supported us over the past 100 years. Our objective is to provide support toward a mission of supply chain stability with a focus on food security.
Recipient organizations include those with strong local and regional networks that ensure families have access to nutritious food. Donations may take the form of corporate cash contributions, product donations, employee volunteerism, and workplace giving (with or without matching contributions).
•Recipient organizations include Feeding America, Ronald McDonald House, and local food banks.
•We support industry organizations, which commit to grow, protect, and enhance supplies of quality coffee while improving the livelihoods of the families who produce it, and the Specialty Coffee Association (the “SCA”) Sustainability Council and the Coalition for Coffee Communities, which are focused on sustainability in coffee growing regions.
•We organize local charities and fund raisers, including support of Ronald McDonald House, riding in the Ride Against Hunger supported by Tarrant Area Food Bank, and hosting local food drives.
•Our usable and near expiring products or products with damaged packaging that can be donated are donated to Feeding America affiliated food banks nationwide, in an effort to keep all edible food waste from going to landfills.
Human Capital
On June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 1,068 employees, 166 of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring on or before June 30, 2025. 
Achieving our vision of building a leading specialty products distributor and service company starts with our people. We believe our human capital management philosophy and programs align with developing and sustaining a culture that embraces our team member values of family, service and quality, collaboration, simplicity and sustainability. We emphasize our value of family by striving for inclusive and equitable approaches in hiring practices, pay practices and team member engagement. 
We continue to attract, develop and retain our team members with the following programs: 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We know our customers represent a wide range of backgrounds and experiences and we strive to build a team that is as diverse and inclusive as our customers and the communities in which we do business. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") committee is comprised of team members across all functions and levels of the organization, including members of the senior management team, and reaches team members across the organization. Our commitments to DEI include: 
•Creating courageous and psychologically safe spaces for all team members through continual learning and development and implementation of Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs).
•Evaluation of all HR programs and processes through a DEI lens to identify and remove bias in our people practices. 
•Increase in diversity supplier partnerships and spend.
•Actively recruiting from organizations that identify, prepare and develop diverse candidates for the workplace (e.g. Texas Workforce Commission, Hiring our Heroes, Mom’s Unfiltered, INROADS Inc., etc.).
•Engagement with community based organizations and local schools and universities to ensure equal access to employment opportunities through job search/interview training, apprenticeships, internships, and other programs.
•Commencement of a project with the National Organization on Disabilities to review our practices, train our leaders and help us increase our employment of people with disabilities. 
Team Member Benefits
We value each team member and, as a result, we provide a Total Rewards Program that strives to deliver the features that our team members value. To accomplish this, we have conducted surveys of our team members over the last three years to make sure we are investing in areas that our people value. Based on team member feedback and in alignment with our values of family, we have emphasized: 
•Stability of our team member benefits costs and expansion of the scope of our benefit programs and options. This has included company-paid short-term disability as well as paid parental leave for all non-union team members. 
•Focused improvement of our overall team member experience, including investments in HR technology, well-being initiatives and a comprehensive Benefits Assistance Center to help employees understand their benefits better.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our team members is crucial. In addition to tracking common indicators, such as injury rates, we have taken a proactive approach to work place safety, including regular company-wide safety training, fleet safety reviews, and measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to focus on all aspects of team member health and safety by creating a Safety First Culture. This includes, but is not limited to, tracking and analyzing injury rates and incident trends, safety training, and team member engagement in the safety process. In fiscal 2022, we rolled out an extensive driver safety curriculum to help keep our team members and others safer on the road. The training will continue in the year ended June 30, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"). 
We manufacture and distribute products deemed essential to critical infrastructure, and as a result, our production sites continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we implemented company safety guidelines improving the physical safety of work environments for our employees that continued to report to work sites. These measures have included increased sanitation procedures, limiting or prohibiting guests to work sites, hand washing, social distancing, mask wearing and temperature checks as well as encouraging individuals to stay home when ill. Further, we provided work from home flexibility for our team members whose jobs did not require them to report to a specific job site, further limiting potential exposure for our team members. 
Raw Materials and Supplies
Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years, the coffee “C” market near month price per pound ranged from approximately $0.86 to $2.60. The coffee “C” market near month price as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 was $2.30 and $1.60 per pound, respectively. Our principal packaging materials include carton board, corrugate and plastic. We also use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities.
We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee regions around the world. Coffee “C” market prices in fiscal 2022 traded in a $1.12 range during the year, and averaged 60% above the historical average for the past five years. There can be no assurance that green coffee prices will remain at these levels in the future. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers, including Direct Trade and Fair Trade Certified™® sources and Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms. Fair Trade Certified™® provides an assurance that farmer groups are receiving the Fair Trade minimum price and an additional premium for certified organic products through arrangements with cooperatives. Direct Trade products provide similar assurance except that the arrangements are provided directly to individual coffee growers instead of to cooperatives, providing these farmers with price premiums and dedicated technical assistance to improve farm conditions and increase both quality and productivity of sustainable coffee crops at the individual farm level. Rainforest Alliance Certified™ coffee is grown using methods that help promote and preserve biodiversity, conserve scarce natural resources, and help farmers build sustainable lives. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements and derivative instruments, as further explained in Note 4, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. 
Intellectual Property
We own a number of United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. We believe our trademarks and service marks are integral to customer identification of our products. It is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, and other proprietary rights that are not registered.
Seasonality
We experience some seasonal influences. The winter months historically have generally been our strongest sales months. However, our product line and geographic diversity provide some sales stability during the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily decreases. Additionally, we usually experience an increase in sales during the summer and early fall months from seasonal businesses located in vacation areas and from grocery retailers ramping up inventory for the winter 
selling season. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Distribution
We operate production facilities in Northlake, Texas and Portland, Oregon. Distribution takes place out of the Northlake and Portland facilities, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; Rialto, California; and Moonachie, New Jersey. Our products reach our customers primarily in the following ways: through our nationwide DSD network of 239 delivery routes and 103 branch warehouses as of June 30, 2022, or direct-shipped via common carriers or third-party distributors. DSD sales are primarily made “off-truck” to our customers at their places of business. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on third-party logistics service providers ("3PL") for our long-haul distribution. We maintain inventory levels at each branch warehouse to promote minimal interruption in supply. We also sell coffee and tea products directly to consumers through our websites and sell certain products at retail and through foodservice distributors. 
Customers
We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers and large national account customers like restaurant, department and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as retail with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, foodservice distributors, and consumers through e-commerce. During fiscal 2022, our top five customers accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales. Although no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years, the loss of, or reduction in, sales to one or more of our top customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Most of our customers rely on us for distribution; however, some of our customers use third-party distribution or conduct their own distribution. Some of our customers are “price” buyers, seeking a low-cost provider with less concern for service, while others find great value in the service programs we provide. We offer a full return policy to ensure satisfaction and extended terms for those customers who qualify. Historically, our product returns have not been significant.
In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The measures taken to contain the spread of the virus adversely affected our business and those of our customers. Our success will depend on our ability and effectiveness in identifying and addressing our customers’ future needs in light of the development of COVID-19, its variants and responsive measures. Although we have already experienced some negative effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict the extent and timing of the impact that a resurgence could have on our customer demand.
Competition and Trends
The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, such as The J.M. Smucker Company (Folgers Coffee) and The Kraft Heinz Company (Maxwell House Coffee), wholesale foodservice distributors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods Holding Corp., regional and national coffee roasters such as Riverview Acquisition Corp. (S&D Coffee & Tea), Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Trilliant Food and Nutrition LLC, Gaviña & Sons, Inc., Royal Cup, Inc., Ronnoco Coffee, LLC, and Community Coffee Company, L.L.C., specialty coffee suppliers such as Rogers Family Company (San Francisco Bay Coffee), Distant Lands Coffee Company, Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., Starbucks Corporation and JAB Holding Company (Peet’s Coffee & Tea), and retail brand beverage manufacturers such as Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores (physical and on-line) such as Costco, Sam’s Club and Restaurant Depot and on-line retailers such as Amazon. We also face competition from growth in the single-serve, ready-to-drink coffee beverage and cold-brewed coffee channels, as well as competition from other beverages, such as soft drinks (including highly caffeinated energy drinks), juices, bottled water, teas and other beverages.
We believe our state-of-the-art production facility, longevity, product quality and offerings, national distribution and equipment service network, industry and sustainability leadership, market insight, comprehensive approach to customer relationship management, and superior customer service are the major factors that differentiate us from our competitors. We compete well when these factors are valued by our customers, and we are less effective when only price matters. Our customer base is price sensitive, and we are often faced with price competition. 
Regulatory Environment
The conduct of our businesses, including, among other things, the production, storage, distribution, sale, labeling, quality and safety of our products, and occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material legal proceedings arising under these regulations except as described in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10‑K. For additional information, see "Risk Factors" under the sub-captions "Risks Related to Our Business and Industry" and "Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Matters"
Other
The nature of our business does not provide for maintenance of or reliance upon a sales backlog. None of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government. We have no material revenues from foreign operations or long-lived assets located in foreign countries.
