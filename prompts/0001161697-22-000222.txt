Company
 
Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. formerly The 4LESS Group, Inc., also previously known as MedCareers Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “MCGI”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 5, 2007. The Company formally operated a website for nurses, nursing schools and nurses’ organizations designed for better communication between nurses and the nursing profession.
 
On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a transaction (the “Share Exchange”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of The 4LESS Corp. (“4LESS”), in exchange for the issuance of (i) nineteen thousand (19,000) shares of Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) six thousand seven hundred fifty (6,750) shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (iii) 870 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Shares have a right to convert, and was converted in December 2021 into common stock of the Company by multiplying the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock by 2.63 on the conversion date. The Share Exchange closed on November 29, 2018.  As a result of the Share Exchange, the former shareholders of 4LESS became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein 4LESS is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the shares issued as a result of the reverse merger except otherwise noted.
 
4Less was formed as Vegas Suspension & Offroad, LLC on October 24, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation with the same name on May 8, 2017. On April 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to The 4Less Corp. The Corporation had S Corporation status. The Corporation operated as an e-commerce auto and truck parts sales company. As a result of the share exchange, the Company became a holding company operating through 4Less and offers products including exhaust systems, suspension systems, wheels, tires, stereo systems, truck bed covers, and shocks.

History
 
The Company was formed as RX Scripted, LLC on December 30, 2004 as a North Carolina limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation as RX Scripted, Inc. on December 5, 2007.
 
On or around January 7, 2010 the Company’s name was changed to MedCareers Group, Inc. Additionally, as a result of filing the Certificate, the Company’s symbol on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board changed to “MCGI”, effective January 7, 2010.
 
On or around November 19, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”) with Nurses Lounge, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Nurses Lounge”) and the nine shareholders of Nurses Lounge (the “Nurses Lounge Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Exchange, we agreed to issue 24,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock to the Nurses Lounge Shareholders in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Nurses Lounge. Although 24,000,000 restricted shares were issued in connection with the Exchange, certain significant shareholders of the Company also agreed to cancel some of the shares they owned so that the net effect of the Exchange was an increase to the outstanding shares by 7,175,000 shares rather than 24,000,000. Included in the shareholders receiving shares in connection with the Exchange, was Timothy Armes founder and president of Nurses Lounge, Inc., who received 14,902,795 shares. In December 2019 Nurses Lounge was disposed of as more fully described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
 
Auto Parts 4Less
 
Like many small businesses, Christopher Davenport, the founder of Auto Parts 4Less (“4Less”) previously named The 4less Corp., the wholly owned subsidiary of Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc., began selling auto parts on eBay and shipping those items out of his garage in 2013. What started out as a hobby, quickly grew into a fully functioning ecommerce aftermarket auto parts company that required a significant technical staff and facilities to support their growth. In June of 2015, they leased their first office.
 
Originally the company listed their auto parts in the different marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Jet. Starting in 2016 the company began investing to become their own ecommerce platform thereby allowing their auto parts to be direct listed across marketplace and social media sites. Technical achievements including CRM system, warehouse integration API, warehouse inventory software to name a few.
 
In 2019, shortly after the share exchange with MedCareers Group, Inc., with technology upgrades in place, 4Less began successfully moving majority of sales from third party marketplaces direct to their proprietary ecommerce web site Liftkits4Less.com. By doing so the company saves 8%-10% in fees charged by the major marketplace’s such as e-Bay and Amazon as well as further building the 4less brand as a leading ecommerce site for auto parts.
 
On November 19, 2019 the Company acquired the URL Autoparts4Less.com and changed the name of their wholly owned subsidiary from the 4Less Corp. to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc. With the acquisition of the URL AutoParts4Less.com, the Company also began focusing all of their efforts and resources on building out a flagship automotive marketplace with the potential to offer buyers a wide range of automotive parts for cars, trucks, boats, motorcycles and RV’s on a single platform.
 
In August 2021 the Company launched a beta test version of Autoparts4less.com. In a short period of time after the beta launch the company realized that with the amount of interest received from numerous types of larges sellers, which included not only ecommerce sites presently selling parts online, but also interest from other large parts sellers such as warehouse distributors, new car dealers with large inventories of parts as well as brick and mortar parts retailers looking to move sales online, the platform originally created would soon be inadequate. As such, the Company made the decision to upgrade to a larger and more advanced platform solution so they immediately began implementation of the AWS Fargate serverless platform solution.
 
The platform upgrade will be done in late 1st quarter FYE 2023, with marketplace sales expected to begin in 2nd quarter 2023.
 On April 28. 2022 the Company changed its name from The 4LESS Group, Inc. to Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc.
 
Competition
 
We directly compete for buyers to use our web sites over current e-commerce sites as well as sellers that utilize major marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. However, we believe our specialty ecommerce website liftkits4less.com offers substantial value-added content including installation guides, install videos, high impact photos, order customization and live chat with a technical expert.
 
Additionally, we believe that our automotive parts marketplace AutoParts4less.com, with no known large challengers presently in the space outside of “all things to all people” online marketplaces Amazon and eBay, has the opportunity to quickly be branded when launched as the auto part’s industry premier marketplace just as sites like Etsy, Wayfair, Uber and Chewey’s have been able to successfully do in their industries.
