BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and subsequent commercialization of novel, first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear transport and related targets for the treatment of cancer and other major diseases. Our scientific expertise is focused on understanding the regulation of intracellular communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing wholly-owned, novel, small molecule Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1). These SINE compounds represent a new class of drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action that have the potential to treat a variety of diseases in areas of unmet medical need. Our SINE compounds were the first oral XPO1 inhibitors in clinical development. 
 Our focus is on seeking the regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead drug candidate, selinexor (KPT-330), as an oral agent in cancer indications with significant unmet clinical need, initially for hematologic malignancies. We then plan to seek additional approvals for the use of selinexor in combination therapies to expand the patient populations that are eligible for selinexor, as well as to move selinexor towards front-line cancer therapy. We are also advancing the clinical development of selinexor in multiple solid tumor indications. To date, over 2,200 patients have been treated with oral selinexor in company- and investigator-sponsored clinical trials in advanced hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Selinexor is currently being evaluated in several later-stage clinical trials, including, among others, the Phase 2b STORM (Selinexor Treatment of Refractory Myeloma) study in multiple myeloma, the Phase 1b/2 STOMP (Selinexor and Backbone Treatments of Multiple Myeloma Patients) study in combination with standard therapies in multiple myeloma, the Phase 2b SADAL (Selinexor Against Diffuse Aggressive Lymphoma) study in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the pivotal, randomized Phase 3 BOSTON (Bortezomib, Selinexor and Dexamethasone) study in multiple myeloma, and the Phase 2/3 SEAL (Selinexor in Advanced Liposarcoma) study in liposarcoma.

We expect to provide top-line data from the expanded cohort for the STORM study at the end of April 2018, top-line data from the SADAL study by the end of 2018, top-line data from the BOSTON study in 2019 and top-line data from the Phase 3 portion of the SEAL study by the end of 2019. We are also establishing the commercial infrastructure to support a potential launch of selinexor in the United States and we intend to work with existing and potential partners to establish such commercial infrastructure outside the United States. In October 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for the development and commercialization of selinexor and eltanexor (KPT-8602) for all human oncology indications in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the ten Southeast Asian countries currently comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
 Summary of Clinical Development 
 Oral selinexor is being evaluated in multiple later-phase clinical trials in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematological and solid tumor malignancies. In general, relapsed disease refers to disease that progresses following the expiration of a specified period of time after discontinuation of therapy and refractory disease refers to disease that progresses while the patient is on therapy or within a specified period of time after discontinuation of therapy. To date, oral selinexor has been administered to more than 2,200 patients across company- and investigator-sponsored clinical trials; the vast majority of these patients have very heavily pretreated, relapsed or refractory disease. Evidence of single-agent anti-cancer activity has been observed in many patients and selinexor has been sufficiently well-tolerated to allow several of these patients to remain on therapy for prolonged periods. Over 50 patients have remained on study for over 12 months, with several patients on study for over 24 months. 
 During 2016 and 2017, we reported several important clinical data sets for selinexor and communicated our plan to pursue a clinical development initiative focused on obtaining our first regulatory approval for selinexor in multiple myeloma. This strategy is based on the positive interim results reported to date from the ongoing Phase 2b STORM study and the ongoing Phase 1b/2 STOMP study. The STORM study is a single-arm clinical trial evaluating oral selinexor in combination with standard, low-dose dexamethasone in patients with penta-refractory myeloma. Patients with penta-refractory myeloma have received several previous treatments, including with alkylating agents, glucocorticoids, two immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), specifically Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and Pomalyst® (pomalidomide), and two proteasome inhibitors (PIs), specifically Velcade® (bortezomib) and Kyprolis® (carfilzomib), as well as an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody such as Darzalex® (daratumumab) or isatuximab; their disease is refractory to at least one of these IMiDs, at least one of these PIs, and at least one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody; and the disease has progressed following their most recent therapy. We believe this STORM study is evaluating a cohort of patients which represents an unmet medical need, meaning there is no standard of care therapy known to be effective in this population. The STOMP study, a multi-arm clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, is evaluating selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone plus standard therapies, such as Revlimid®, Pomalyst®, Velcade®, Kyprolis® or Darzalex®; a new arm of the study evaluating selinexor in combination with Revlimid® in patients with previously untreated myeloma is also being opened. 
 In the clinical data set for Part 1 of the STORM study, which we reported in 2016, in patients with heavily pretreated refractory multiple myeloma, selinexor demonstrated robust response rates and duration, compelling overall survival rates, and a favorable safety profile. Based on results from this Part of the STORM study, we expanded the STORM study, designated Part 2, to include approximately 120 additional patients with clearly documented penta-refractory multiple myeloma. We expect to report top-line data from Part 2 of the STORM study at the end of April 2018. Assuming a positive outcome from Part 2 of the STORM study, we plan to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the second half of 2018, with a request for accelerated approval for selinexor in penta-refractory multiple myeloma, followed thereafter by a potential submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requesting conditional approval. 
 Data from the STOMP study, initially presented in December 2016 at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting, showed that selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone and Velcade® demonstrated high 
 
4 
 
 disease response rates, including for patients whose disease was previously refractory to PIs including Velcade® and/or Kyprolis®. Based on the positive results from the Velcade® arm of the STOMP study, we are conducting the pivotal Phase 3 BOSTON study in patients with multiple myeloma who have had one to three prior lines of therapy. The BOSTON study is evaluating selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone and Velcade® compared to low-dose dexamethasone plus Velcade®. For the BOSTON study, we have identified the combination dose of selinexor 100mg orally once weekly plus dexamethasone 20mg orally twice weekly and Velcade® 1.3mg/m2 subcutaneously once weekly for 4 of 5 weeks, and we expect the study will enroll approximately 360 patients. If successful, the BOSTON study may qualify as a full-approval study and potentially serve as a confirmatory study if the STORM study is successful and results in accelerated and/or conditional approval. 
 In December 2016, we presented clinical data from the STOMP study at the ASH 2016 annual meeting indicating that selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone plus Velcade® or Pomalyst® demonstrates high response rates when combined. At the following ASH 2017 annual meeting, we presented updated clinical data from the STOMP study further indicating that selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone plus Velcade® or Pomalyst® demonstrates high response rates when combined. We also presented new data at the ASH 2017 annual meeting indicating that selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone plus Revlimid® or Darzalex® demonstrated high response rates. A year earlier at the ASH 2016 annual meeting, preliminary safety and efficacy of selinexor plus Kyprolis® (dosed twice weekly) and dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma was presented. The STOMP study is being expanded to evaluate selinexor plus Kyprolis® dosed once weekly. In addition, we are planning a new arm in the STOMP study that will evaluate selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone plus Revlimid® in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
 Key clinical trials of selinexor are summarized in the chart below. In addition to these studies, there are several ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials in a variety of hematological and solid tumor malignancies.

We previously announced data from the STORM, STOMP, SADAL, SEAL and KING studies and these data are described further herein. We currently expect to provide data related to the ongoing studies of selinexor listed above as follows: 
 STORM: Phase 2b expansion top-line data (overall response rate) in April 2018; 
 STOMP: Updated data from ongoing study arms (Revlimid®, Pomalyst®, Velcade® and Darzalex®) and potentially data from a new study arm (Kyprolis®) during 2018; 
 SADAL: Phase 2b top-line data (overall response rate) by the end of 2018; 
 BOSTON: Randomized Phase 3 top-line data (progression-free survival and overall response rate) in 2019; and 
 SEAL: Randomized Phase 3 top-line data (progression-free survival) by the end of 2019. 
 In addition to selinexor, we are also advancing a pipeline of novel drug candidates in oncology. We began clinical testing of oral eltanexor (KPT-8602), a second-generation SINE compound, in late 2015. We reported results at the ASH 2017 annual meeting showing good tolerability in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and we expanded clinical development of eltanexor to include myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), colorectal cancer (CRC), and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We began clinical testing of oral KPT-9274, a dual PAK4/NAMPT inhibitor, in patients with lymphoma or solid tumors during 2016, and we reported top-line data at the 2017 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting showing a manageable safety profile and early signals of antitumor activity. During 2017, we licensed to Anivive Lifesciences exclusive worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of oral verdinexor (KPT-335) for the treatment of cancer in companion animals. Our pipeline of drug candidates in oncology other than selinexor is summarized in the chart below. 
 


In addition to its role in cancer, XPO1 is known to play a role in neurological, inflammatory, viral, wound healing and other diseases. In the hands of academic collaborators, SINE compounds have shown activity in a variety of non-oncology models consistent with the biology of XPO1. In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Biogen MA Inc., a subsidiary of Biogen Inc. (Biogen), pursuant to which Biogen acquired KPT-350, an investigational new drug application-ready, oral SINE compound with a preclinical data package supporting potential efficacy in a number of neuro-inflammatory conditions, as well as certain related assets with an initial focus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). SINE compounds have also demonstrated activity in animal models of viral diseases, certain rare diseases and other indications, and we are continuing to develop programs in these areas largely through academic collaborations and non-dilutive funding opportunities with the intent to out-license these programs for clinical development and future commercialization.

Since our founding by Dr. Sharon Shacham in 2008, our goal has been to establish a leading, independent oncology business. We are led by Dr. Shacham, our President and Chief Scientific Officer, and Dr. Michael Kauffman, our Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Kauffman played a leadership role in the development and approval of Velcade® at Millennium Pharmaceuticals and of Kyprolis® while serving as Chief Medical Officer at Proteolix and then Onyx Pharmaceuticals. Both prior to her founding of Karyopharm and while at Karyopharm, Dr. Shacham has played a leadership role in the discovery and development of many novel drug candidates, which have been or are being tested in human clinical trials. 
 Since our inception, we have devoted most of our efforts to research and development, and we have not generated any revenue to date from the commercial sale of any drugs. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $495.3 million. We had net losses of $129.0 million, $109.6 million and $118.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our research and development expenses and financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate.

Summary of Mechanism of Action: Transient XPO1 Inhibition by SINE Compounds 
 Certain functions may only occur within a particular location in the cell, so one of the ways a cell regulates the function of a particular protein is by controlling that proteins location within the cell. The nuclear pore is a complex gate between the nucleus and cytoplasm, regulating the import and export of most large molecules, called macromolecules, including many proteins, into and out of the nucleus. In healthy cells, nuclear transport, both into and out of the nucleus, is a normal and regular occurrence that is tightly regulated and requires the presence of specific carrier proteins. XPO1 mediates the export of over 220 mammalian cargo proteins and some growth-promoting mRNAs. Particularly, XPO1 mediates the transport of the majority of tumor suppressor proteins and appears to be the only mediator of nuclear export for these proteins. Cancer cells have increased levels of XPO1, causing the increased export of these tumor suppressor proteins from the nucleus. Since the tumor suppressor proteins must be located in the nucleus to survey for damage and initiate programmed cell death, or apoptosis, XPO1 overexpression in cancer cells counteracts the genome surveillance process that detects DNA damage which can promote cancer. By blocking XPO1, our SINE compounds inhibit the export of tumor suppressor proteins, leading to their accumulation in the nucleus. Subsequently, the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins amplifies their natural apoptotic function in cancer cells, but with minimal effects on normal cells. Further, SINE compounds reduce the translation of certain growth-promoting and anti-apoptosis proteins  often called oncoproteins  by inhibiting the XPO1-mediated nuclear to cytoplasmic transport of the mRNAs that code for these proteins. The figure below depicts the process by which our SINE compounds inhibit the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins and oncoprotein mRNAs. 
 


We believe that the XPO1-inhibiting SINE compounds that we have discovered and developed to date, including selinexor, have the potential to provide novel, oral, targeted therapies that enable tumor suppressor proteins to remain in the nucleus and promote the apoptosis of potentially any type of cancer cell. Cancer treatments with our SINE compounds spare normal cells, which, unlike cancer cells, do not have significant damage to their genetic material, and we believe this selectivity for cancer cells minimizes side effects. In 
 
8 
 
 multiple cancer types, patient tumor biopsies have confirmed that selinexor treatment induces nuclear localization of tumor suppressor proteins and, subsequently, cancer cell death, or apoptosis. We believe that no currently approved cancer treatments and only one current clinical-stage cancer drug candidate are selectively targeting the restoration and increase in the levels of multiple tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus. Thus, we believe that selinexors novel mechanism of action and oral administration and low levels of major organ toxicities observed to date in patients treated with selinexor in clinical trials, along with encouraging efficacy data, support the potential for selinexors broad use across many cancer types, including both hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Our SINE compounds were the first oral XPO1 inhibitors in clinical development. We own all intellectual property rights related to the compounds that we are developing, including composition of matter and method of use patents covering selinexor issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2015 and which provide patent protection through at least 2032, prior to any adjustments or extensions. 
 Our Strategy 
 The critical components of our business strategy are to: 
 

 | Develop and Seek Regulatory Approval of Selinexor, Our Lead Novel Drug Candidate, in North America and Europe. We plan to seek regulatory approvals of selinexor in North America and Europe for each indication in which we receive favorable results in a trial with a survival endpoint that is registration-enabling. We may also seek regulatory approvals where a clinical trial demonstrates significant data in a surrogate endpoint, such as overall response rate, that could allow for accelerated or conditional approval. We or our current or future partners may seek full or conditional approvals in other geographies as well.

 | Maximize the Commercial Value of Selinexor. In October 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for the development and commercialization of selinexor and eltanexor for all human oncology indications in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the ASEAN countries. We currently hold development, marketing, and commercialization rights for selinexor in all other countries and are positioned to develop selinexor and to seek regulatory approval for its use in oncology indications without a collaborator in North America and Europe. We are also establishing the commercial infrastructure to support a potential launch of selinexor in the United States and we intend to work with existing and potential partners to establish such commercial infrastructure outside the United States.

 | Maintain Our Competitive Advantage and Scientific Expertise in the Field of Nuclear Transport. To further our understanding of the role nuclear transport plays in the underlying biology of cancer, as well other major diseases, we plan to continue research in the field of nuclear transport and related areas, primarily by fostering relationships with top scientific advisors and physicians. We have taken this approach in the past with KPT-350, an investigational new drug application-ready, oral SINE compound with a preclinical data package supporting potential efficacy in a number of neuro-inflammatory conditions, which Biogen recently acquired from us. We believe that investing in the recruitment of exceptional advisors, employees, and management is critical to our continued leadership in the nuclear transport field. We are collaborating with leading patient advocacy groups to provide education on the science behind our SINE compounds and to support the development and execution of clinical trials. We have advanced the understanding and potential application of selinexor in cancer treatment through a broad range of collaborations with leading institutions engaged in evaluating selinexor in clinical trials in the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, India, Israel, Singapore and elsewhere.

 | Continue Developing our Pipeline of Novel Drug Candidates. To date, we have identified several drug candidates: our oral SINE compounds selinexor (KPT-330), eltanexor (KPT-8602) and verdinexor (KPT-335) and our oral dual PAK4/NAMPT inhibitor, KPT-9274. A fifth program, KPT-350 for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuro-inflammatory conditions, was sold to Biogen in January 2018. While we may identify or in-license novel drug candidates for development in oncology in the future, we are currently focused on the development of our existing pipeline of drug candidates.

 | Maximize the Value of Our Other SINE Compounds in Non-Oncology Indications through Collaborations. We may seek to enter into global or regional development, marketing, and commercialization collaboration arrangements for our other SINE compounds in non-oncology indications. For example, during 2017, we licensed to Anivive Lifesciences exclusive worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of verdinexor (KPT-335) for the treatment of cancer in companion animals. As described above, in January 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Biogen pursuant to which Biogen acquired KPT-350 as well as certain related assets with an initial focus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Our Focus: Nuclear Transport 
 Cancer is a disease characterized by unregulated cell growth. Cancer cells develop when DNA inside the nucleus of normal cells accumulates damage in genes that regulate cell growth and survival. In healthy cells, proteins called tumor suppressor proteins help prevent accumulation of DNA damage (mutations, chromosomal translocations and other abnormalities) by monitoring DNA for damage, and if damage is detected, the tumor suppressor proteins direct the cell to attempt to repair it. However, if the DNA damage is too severe, the tumor suppressor proteins direct the cell to die in a process called apoptosis. 
 Proteins, however, are not made inside the nucleus but rather made outside of the nucleus in an area called the cytoplasm. A membrane, called the nuclear membrane, separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. All large nuclear proteins (larger than 40kDa), including tumor suppressor proteins, must be transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to perform their functions in keeping a cell healthy. Proteins are brought into the nucleus from the cytoplasm through a protein complex embedded in the nuclear membrane called the nuclear pore. The nuclear pore works like a gate through which large molecules, including many other proteins, enter and exit the nucleus. When molecules enter the nucleus from the cytoplasm, the process is called import, and when molecules exit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the process is called export. The import and export of most proteins and other large molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm require specific carrier proteins to chaperone their cargo molecules through the nuclear pore complex. Carrier proteins which mediate the import of macromolecules into the nucleus are called importins, and those which mediate the export of macromolecules out of the nucleus are called exportins. 
 Eight exportins have been identified in human cells. One such export carrier protein was discovered in 1999 and is called exportin 1 (XPO1 or CRM1). XPO1 helps export over 220 cargo proteins. In particular, XPO1 appears to be the sole exporter for most of the tumor suppressor proteins including p53, p21, p27, APC, FOXO, pRB and survivin. In addition to exporting tumor suppressor proteins out of the nucleus, XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of a protein called eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), also called the mRNA cap binding protein. eIF4E binds to the mRNAs for many growth-regulating proteins, including c-myc, bcl-2, bcl-6, Atk1, hDM2 and cyclin D. eIF4E depends on XPO1 to help carry these growth-promoting mRNAs from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where the mRNAs are efficiently translated into proteins. XPO1 also exports the anti-inflammatory protein IkB, which inhibits a protein called NF-kB. NF-kB is found in the nucleus of most cancer cells and plays a role in cancer metastasis and chemotherapy resistance, as well as in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. By exporting IkB out of the nucleus, XPO1 augments NF-kB activity. 
 XPO1 levels are reported to be elevated in nearly all cancer cells when compared to their healthy cell counterparts. Therefore, these elevated levels of XPO1 in cancer cells mediate the rapid export of tumor suppressor proteins as well as IkB and eIF4E out of the nucleus. When compared to healthy cells, the increased export of tumor suppressor proteins in cancer cells may lead to reduced monitoring for DNA damage, the normal triggering of apoptosis and increased NF-kB activity. Higher levels of XPO1 expression in cancer cells is also generally correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis of patients. 
 Inhibiting XPO1 leads to accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins as well as eIF4E and IkB in the cell nucleus, which has been confirmed in a variety of preclinical models as well as in tumor biopsy tissues from 
 
10 
 
 patients treated with selinexor. Accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins increases monitoring for DNA damage and triggering of apoptosis in cancer cells. Also, blocking XPO1 can cause accumulation of bound growth-promoting mRNAs, which may cause a reduction in the levels of growth-promoting proteins in cancer cells; this has also been confirmed in preclinical models and tumor biopsy tissues. Accumulation of IkB in the nucleus inhibits NF-kB, which may be beneficial in overcoming chemotherapy resistance and in treating autoimmune, inflammatory, and neuro-inflammatory disease. For these reasons, we believe blocking XPO1 is a good strategy for treating cancer, autoimmune, inflammatory, and neuro-inflammatory diseases. The figure below depicts the process by which XPO1 mediates the nuclear transport process. 
 XPO1 Mediation of Nuclear Transport 
 


Our Approach: Targeting Nuclear Export with SINE Compounds 
 Our lead drug candidates are first-in-class, oral, Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds. We designed SINE compounds by applying our proprietary drug discovery and optimization expertise to the X-ray structure of XPO1 published in 2009. SINE compounds inhibit XPO1-mediated nuclear export by strongly, yet reversibly, binding to the XPO1 cargo binding site, effectively blocking the XPO1-cargo protein interaction. The transient XPO1 inhibition period that we have observed to date with our SINE compounds appears to be sufficient for elevation of tumor suppressor protein levels and IkB in the nucleus. Accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus of cancer cells allows them to perform their normal role of detecting DNA damage, thereby inhibiting a cancer cells ability to divide and promoting apoptosis. Healthy cells also accumulate tumor suppressor proteins in the presence of a SINE compound, but they do not undergo apoptosis after transient XPO1 inhibition because they have minimal or no DNA damage. The figure below depicts the process by which SINE compounds inhibit the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins.

Transient XPO1 Inhibition by SINE Compounds 
 


In addition to cancer, our SINE compounds have demonstrated the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in a number of other indications. Specifically, SINE compounds have shown evidence of activity in preclinical models of viral infections, neurological disorders, inflammation and autoimmune diseases. 
 Our Initial Indication: Cancer 
 Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015. Globally, nearly one in six deaths is due to cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States in 2018, approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed and approximately 610,000 people will die of cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer projects that in 2030, 21.7 million people will be diagnosed with cancer, and 13 million people will die of cancer worldwide, as compared to 14.1 million new cancer diagnoses in 2012 and 8.8 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2015. 
 The most common methods for treating patients with cancer are a combination of surgery, radiation, and drug therapy. Locoregional therapies, such as surgery and radiation therapy, are particularly effective with localized disease. However, in situations where the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through locoregional therapies, physicians generally use systemic drug therapies. In many cases, drug therapy includes combinations of several different drugs. An early approach to cancer treatment was through cytotoxic drugs that kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells by nonspecific mechanisms, such as disrupting cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for survival and rapid growth. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, they act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy cells as well as cancer cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are not effective in promoting cancer cell death. A different approach to pharmacological cancer treatment has been to 
 
12 
 
 develop drugs referred to as targeted therapeutics, that target specific biological molecules in the human body that play a role in the rapid cell growth and spread of cancer. Targeted therapeutics are designed specifically to exploit vulnerabilities in cancer cells to improve efficacy, and to minimize side effects. The drugs are designed to either attack a target that causes uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of a genetic alteration more often found in cancer cells than in healthy cells or attack a target that cancer cells are more dependent on for their growth than are healthy cells. 
 Our SINE compounds are novel therapies specifically designed to force nuclear accumulation in the levels of multiple tumor suppressor and growth regulatory proteins. Tumor suppressor proteins assess a cells DNA and in cells with heavily damaged DNA, such as cancer cells, these proteins induce cell death, or apoptosis. Unlike many other targeted therapeutic approaches that only work for a specific set of cancers or in a specific subgroup of patients, we believe that by restoring tumor suppressor proteins to the nucleus where they can assess a cells DNA, our SINE compounds have the potential to provide therapeutic benefits across a broad range of both hematological and solid tumor malignancies and benefit a wider range of patients. Additionally, and as supported by its mechanism of action and preclinical and clinical data, we believe that selinexor has the potential for additive or synergistic benefit with approved and experimental therapies in treating cancer patients. As a result, we believe that selinexor has the potential to serve as a backbone therapy across multiple hematological and solid tumor malignancies as part of a variety of combination therapies. 
 Our Oncology Drug Candidates 
 Selinexor (KPT-330)
Selinexor is being evaluated in multiple later phase clinical trials in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Anti-cancer activity has been observed with tumor reductions and durable disease control across many hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Over 50 patients have remained on oral selinexor, either as a single-agent or in combination with other agents, for over 12 months, with several patients on study over 24 months. 
 In our lead hematologic indication of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, selinexor has demonstrated encouraging response rates, including a 20% response rate and prolonged survival in patients whose disease is relapsed or refractory following treatment with the currently available therapies. When used in combination with other anti-myeloma agents, including Revlimid® (lenalidomide), Pomalyst® (pomalidomide), Velcade® (bortezomib) and Darzalex® (daratumumab), selinexor has generated response rates ranging from 63% to 92%. In patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), our next lead indication, selinexor has demonstrated a response rate of 33%, and similar rates in both germinal center (GCB) and non-GCB subtypes of the disease. In liposarcoma, our lead solid tumor indication, selinexor has demonstrated superior progression-free survival versus placebo, achieving a hazard ratio of 0.6, which represents a 40% reduction of disease progression or death. 
 To date, the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) are predictable in the patient populations being studied and have been generally reversible and/or manageable with standard supportive care and/or dose modification. These AEs often decrease over time and are consistent with those previously reported by patients in our initial clinical trials. A preliminary analysis of safety and tolerability of selinexor was performed on unaudited AE data for 1,412 patients enrolled in our company-sponsored hematological malignancy and solid tumor clinical trials as of the data cutoff point of March 31, 2017. Overall, the most commonly reported selinexor-related AEs in ongoing clinical studies were generally low-grade and included nausea (62%), fatigue (60%), anorexia (51%), thrombocytopenia (42%), and vomiting (37%). Thrombocytopenia, the most common hematologic treatment-related AE, was reported among 42% of patients, and approximately half of these were Grades 3 to 4. The dosing regimens currently used in our key clinical trials, including BOSTON, STORM, STOMP, SADAL and SEAL, have shown predictable and manageable tolerability, particularly when used once weekly in combination regimens. In certain studies, the AEs reported from treatment arms evaluating selinexor 
 
13 
 
 and dexamethasone in combination with other antimyeloma agents were similar to, or reduced, compared to selinexor and dexamethasone alone. 
 We describe below the key company- and investigator-sponsored studies evaluating selinexor in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, both as a single-agent and in combination. Additional data from company- and investigator-sponsored combination studies may be presented on an ongoing basis by us and/or our collaborators at scientific conferences or through other publications at various times. Unless otherwise indicated, response data presented herein are interim unaudited data based on reports by physicians at the clinical trial sites. Responses in hematological trials are measured using commonly accepted evaluation criteria for the specific indication. Responses in solid tumor trials are evaluated using RECIST unless otherwise noted. 
 Advanced Hematological Malignancies 
 Multiple Myeloma 
 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) in the serum or urine, bone disease, kidney disease and immunodeficiency. It is more common in elderly patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 65-70 years. In the United States, the American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 31,000 new cases of MM, with about 12,800 attributable deaths, in 2018. The World Health Organization estimated that approximately 114,000 new cases of MM were diagnosed worldwide in 2012. 
 The treatment of MM has improved in the last 20 years due to the use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, which is restricted to healthier, often younger patients, and the subsequent introduction of IMiDs, such as Revlimid® and Pomalyst®, and the PIs Velcade®, Kyprolis® (carfilzomib), and Ninlaro® (ixazomib). Two monoclonal antibodies, Darzalex® and Empliciti (elotuzumab), have also recently been approved, as has the histone deacetylase inhibitor Farydak® (panobinostat). The introduction of non-chemotherapeutic agents has led to a significant increase in the survival of patients with MM. Although a wide variety of newly approved or experimental therapies are being used in relapsed and/or refractory patients, including new proteasome inhibitors (oprozomib and marizomib), monoclonal antibodies (with or without toxin conjugates) and cellular therapies like chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, nearly all patients will eventually relapse and succumb to their disease. With about 12,800 deaths from MM in the United States alone expected to occur, we believe that there remains a need for therapies for patients whose disease has relapsed after, or is refractory to, available therapy. 
 STORM: Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Selinexor and Low-Dose Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma 
 In May 2015, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating oral selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone in patients with heavily pretreated MM. The Selinexor Treatment of Refractory Myeloma, or STORM, study is a single-arm study evaluating the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM with 80mg of selinexor and 20mg of dexamethasone, each dosed twice weekly. This 40mg per week dose of dexamethasone is considered low dose in the treatment of MM, compared with the high dose dexamethasone which uses three times more of the steroid. 
 At the ASH annual meeting in December 2016, we presented results, adjudicated by an independent review committee, from the first cohort of patients enrolled in the STORM study, which included patients with either quad-refractory or penta-refractory MM. Patients with quad-refractory disease had previously received prior treatments that included alkylating agents, glucocorticoids, two IMiDs (Revlimid® and Pomalyst®), and two PIs (Velcade® and Kyprolis®), and their disease is refractory to at least one IMiD and at least one PI, and has progressed following their most recent therapy. Patients with penta-refractory myeloma have quad-refractory disease that is also refractory to an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, such as Darzalex® or isatuximab. For the STORM study, in accordance with the FDA guidance we received, patients are required to have disease that is 
 
14 
 
 refractory to Darzalex® as the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. We believe that this penta-refractory population represents a clear unmet medical need as this group of patients has no available or approved therapies that have demonstrated clinical benefit. 
 Among the 78 patients available for efficacy assessment prior to the data cutoff date of November 1, 2016, the median number of prior treatments regimens was seven and the overall response rate (ORR) as adjudicated by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) was 21% and included very good partial responses (VGPRs) and partial responses (PRs). Among the 48 patients in the quad-refractory group, the ORR was 21%. For comparison, in a similar patient population with quad-refractory disease, the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies Darzalex® and isatuximab had ORRs of 21% and 20%, respectively. Among the 30 patients in the penta-refractory group, the ORR was 20%. Clinical benefit rate (CBR), which is percentage of patients with a minor response (MR) or better, was 33% across all 78 patients, 29% among the patients with quad-refractory disease, and 40% among the patients with penta-refractory disease. Median overall survival (OS) was 9.3 months for all patients, longer than 11 months without a median reached in patients with a MR or better, and 5.7 months for patients who did not have any response. Median duration of response (DOR) was 5 months. Cytopenias of Grade 3 or Grade 4 were the most common side effects and were generally not associated with clinical sequellae. Nausea, anorexia and fatigue were the most common non-hematological side effects, primarily Grades 1 and 2, and were treatable with supportive care and/or dose modification. There were low rates of non-hematologic toxicities of Grades 3 or 4, with no new safety signals identified. In particular, there was one reported case of Grade 4 infection (1.3%), one reported case of Grade 2 neuropathy (1.3%) and one reported case of sepsis (1.3%). 
 Based on these results, we expanded the STORM study to add an additional cohort of approximately 122 additional patients with penta-refractory MM. The primary endpoint of the STORM study is ORR as adjudicated by the IRC. The trial has several secondary endpoints including the median DOR. 
 We expect to report top-line data from the expanded STORM cohort at the end of April 2018. Assuming a positive outcome from the expanded cohort of the STORM study, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA during the second half of 2018 with a request for accelerated approval for selinexor in penta-refractory MM, followed thereafter by a potential submission to the EMA requesting conditional approval in this same patient population. 
 STOMP: Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial of Selinexor in Combination with Backbone Therapies in Multiple Myeloma 
 Based on preclinical synergy in animal models of MM, in October 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical study of oral selinexor in combination with available treatments for relapsed/refractory MM. In this multi-arm study, Selinexor and Backbone Treatments of Multiple Myeloma Patients (STOMP), we are evaluating the combination of selinexor and low-dose dexamethasone with Revlimid®, Pomalyst®, Velcade®, Kyprolis® and Darzalex® in patients with previously treated MM. Each combination is evaluated on a separate arm of the STOMP study and within each combination, two treatment cohorts evaluate once weekly versus twice weekly dosing of selinexor. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion are to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 and Phase 3 doses for selinexor in these combination therapies. The primary objectives of the Phase 2 portion are to assess preliminary efficacy through ORR, CBR and DOR. 
 Selinexor in Combination with Velcade® and Low-dose Dexamethasone (SVd) 
 At the ASH 2017 annual meeting, we presented updated results from the selinexor, Velcade® and dexamethasone arm of the STOMP study, referred to as SVd, at the 2017 ASH annual meeting. In this study arm, oral selinexor was dose-escalated in once-weekly (80 or 100mg) or twice-weekly (60 or 80mg) regimens. Velcade® (1.3mg/m2 subcutaneously) was administered once-weekly or twice-weekly. Dexamethasone was administered orally either 40mg once-weekly or 20mg twice-weekly. The patients in this cohort were heavily pretreated and many (43%) had MM refractory to a proteasome inhibitor. Across the 42 patients enrolled in the SVd arm as of November 15, 2017, the median number of treatment regimens was three (range of one to 11 prior 
 
15 
 
 treatment regimens). Of the overall 40 patients evaluable for efficacy, as of November 15, 2017, 25 responded for an ORR of 63% (three patients having a complete response, or CR, nine patients having a VGPR and 13 patients having a PR). The majority of patients had reductions in M-protein, including 33% with a 90% or greater reduction. Among the 19 patients with PI relapsed/naïve disease, the ORR was 84% and the median progression-free survival (PFS), was greater than 13 months. The results were similar in the subgroup of 18 patients with PI relapsed/naïve disease and between one and three prior treatment regimens, which is also the patient population closest to those eligible for the BOSTON study. These response rates compare favorably to standard Vd regimens (the control arm of the BOSTON study), which typically show response rates of 60% to 65% and PFS of seven to nine months across many previous studies. Amongst the 21 patients with PI-refractory disease where retreatment with Vd alone would not be expected to induce a significant response, the ORR following SVd treatment was 43%, suggesting that the addition of selinexor to Vd in patients with PI-refractory MM could resensitize their disease to a treatment regimen including a PI. 
 Based on these data, the recommended dose regimen for the SVd arm was identified as selinexor (100mg once weekly), Velcade® (1.3mg/m2 weekly given sub-cutaneously for four of five weeks) and dexamethasone (40mg weekly), which represents 40% less Velcade® and 25% less dexamethasone compared to the approved standard Vd regimen. Among the 42 patients evaluable for safety as of the November 15, 2017 data cutoff date, the most common Grade 1/2 AEs were nausea (57%), anorexia (57%), fatigue (45%), diarrhea (36%) and vomiting (29%). Importantly, the reported peripheral neuropathy across all patients was Grade 1/2 and limited to six patients (14%), of which five had prior Velcade® exposure. The most common Grade 3 or higher AEs were thrombocytopenia (45%), neutropenia (24%), fatigue (14%) and anemia (12%). 
 Selinexor in Combination with Pomalyst® and Low-dose Dexamethasone (SPd) 
At the ASH 2017 annual meeting, we also presented updated results from the selinexor, Pomalyst® and dexamethasone arm of the STOMP study, referred to as SPd. In this study arm, selinexor was dosed orally either once weekly (60 or 80mg) or twice weekly (60 or 80mg) with Pomalyst® (4mg orally, once daily) and dexamethasone (orally, 40mg once weekly or 20mg twice weekly). Across the 31 patients enrolled in the SPd arm as of November 1, 2017, the median number of prior treatment regimens was four (range of two to nine prior treatment regimens). Of the overall 27 patients evaluable for efficacy as of November 15, 2017, 15 responded for an ORR of 56% (two patients having a VGPR and 13 patients having a PR). In the Pomalyst®-naïve and Revlimid®-relapsed or -refractory population (19 patients), the ORR was 63% and the median PFS was 11.6 months. Responses tended to occur rapidly with a median of one month to onset. The median PFS of 11.6 months for SPd compares favorably with the PFS of approximately 4 months reported for standard Pd regimens in the Revlimid®-refractory or -relapsed population. 
 Among the 31 patients evaluable for safety as of November 1, 2017, the most common Grade 1/2 AEs were nausea (52%), anorexia (45%), fatigue (45%) and diarrhea (32%). The most common Grade 3 or higher AEs were neutropenia (55%), thrombocytopenia (32%) and anemia (29%). Gastrointestinal AEs were generally manageable with antiemetics. There were two Grade 5 treatment-related events (febrile neutropenia and intracranial hemorrhage). Five dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Grade 3 fatigue, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia) were observed in patients receiving selinexor 60mg twice weekly or 80mg once weekly. Based on the activity and tolerability observed in this study arm, doses of oral selinexor of 60mg and 80mg once weekly are being evaluated in combination with Pomalyst® (3mg orally, once daily) and low dose dexamethasone to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for this combination regimen. 
 Selinexor in Combination with Revlimid® and Low-dose Dexamethasone (SRd) 
 At the ASH 2017 annual meeting, we also presented new data from the selinexor, Revlimid® and dexamethasone arm of the STOMP study, referred to as SRd. In this study arm, oral selinexor was dose-escalated starting at either 60mg once weekly or 60mg twice weekly, with Revlimid® (25mg orally, once daily), and dexamethasone (orally, 40mg once weekly or 20mg twice weekly). Across the 19 patients enrolled in the SRd 
 
16 
 
 arm as of November 1, 2017, the median number of prior treatment regimens was one (range of one to seven prior treatment regimens). Of the 16 patients evaluable for efficacy, as of November 15, 2017, 13 responded for an ORR of 81% (three patients having a VGPR and 10 patients having a PR). Among the 12 patients in the Revlimid®-naïve population, the ORR was 92%. Median PFS was not reached for either the overall study population or for patients with Revlimid®-naïve disease. The median time on treatment for the overall study population was also not reached. 
 Among the 19 patients evaluable for safety as of November 15, 2017, the most common Grade 1/2 AEs were nausea (68%), anorexia (42%), fatigue (42%), weight loss (42%), constipation (32%) and vomiting (32%). The most common Grade 3 or higher AEs were thrombocytopenia (68%) and neutropenia (58%). Gastrointestinal AEs were generally manageable with antiemetics. Five DLTs (thrombocytopenia (four patients) and anorexia (one patient)) were observed in patients receiving selinexor 60mg twice weekly and 80mg once weekly. Thrombocytopenia and anorexia were reduced in the selinexor 60mg once weekly cohort versus the twice weekly groups. Based on the activity and tolerability observed in this study arm, the recommended dose of the all-oral SRd is selinexor (60mg orally, once weekly), Revlimid® (25mg orally, once daily) and dexamethasone (40mg orally, once weekly). 
 Selinexor in Combination with Darzalex® and Low-dose Dexamethasone (SDd) 
 At the ASH 2017 annual meeting, we presented new data from the selinexor, Darzalex® and dexamethasone arm of the STOMP study, referred to as SDd. In this study arm, oral selinexor was dose escalated using either 100mg once weekly or 60mg twice weekly, with Darzalex® (16mg/kg intravenously once weekly) and dexamethasone (orally, 40mg once weekly or 20mg twice weekly). Across the nine patients enrolled in the SDd arm as of November 1, 2017, the median number of prior treatment regimens was four (range of two to 10 prior treatment regimens). Of the eight patients evaluable for efficacy, as of November 15, 2017, five responded for an ORR of 63% (three patients having a VGPR and two patients having a PR). Among the six patients in the Darzalex®-naïve population, the ORR was 83%. Responses tended to occur rapidly with a median of one month to onset. 
 Among the nine patients evaluable for safety as of November 15, 2017, the most common Grade 1/2 AEs were fatigue (44%), nausea (33%) and neutropenia (33%). The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were thrombocytopenia (56%), leukopenia (44%), anemia (44%) and neutropenia (33%). Gastrointestinal AEs were generally manageable with antiemetics. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Two DLTs (Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and Grade 2 fatigue) were observed in patients receiving selinexor 60mg twice weekly; both patients showed responses. Based on the preliminary tolerability and efficacy data, the RP2D of SDd is selinexor (100mg orally, once weekly), Darzalex® (16mg/kg, once weekly) and dexamethasone (40mg orally, once weekly). 
 Selinexor in Combination with Kyprolis® and Low-dose Dexamethasone (SKd)
We are conducting an additional arm of the STOMP study evaluating selinexor, Kyprolis® and dexamethasone, referred to as SKd. Based on investigator-sponsored trial data reported in 2016 with this combination, the dosing regimen selected for STOMP is selinexor (100mg once weekly), Kyprolis® (56 or 70mg/m2 intravenously once weekly) and dexamethasone (40mg orally, once weekly). We expect to report preliminary results from the SKd arm by the end of 2018. 
 Selinexor in Combination with Revlimid® and Low-dose Dexamethasone in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (SRd NDMM)
We plan to conduct an additional arm of the STOMP study evaluating selinexor, Revlimid® and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), referred to as SRd NDMM. Patients eligible for this arm must have symptomatic NDMM requiring systemic therapy. Eligible patients must 
 
17 
 
 not have had any prior systemic therapy for NDMM other than corticosteroids. We expect that starting dose of oral selinexor will be 60mg (once weekly) with 40mg of dexamethasone (orally, weekly) and 25mg of Revlimid® (orally, once daily). 
 BOSTON: Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Selinexor, Velcade® and Low-Dose Dexamethasone vs. Velcade® and Low-Dose Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma 
 Based on the data from the SVd arm of the STOMP study and following consultation with the FDA and the EMA, we are conducting a pivotal randomized Phase 3 study, known as the BOSTON (Bortezomib, Selinexor and dexamethasone) study, which is evaluating SVd compared to standard Velcade® and low-dose dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with MM who have had one to three prior lines of therapy. We expect that the BOSTON study will enroll approximately 360 patients who will be randomized in a one-to-one fashion to receive either SVd or Vd. The dosing schedule allows for only one scheduled clinic visit per week for patients on the SVd arm with selinexor and Velcade® to be dosed not more frequently than once per week. Importantly, dosing on the SVd arm will use 40% less Velcade® and 25% less dexamethasone than the Vd arm, which will follow the standard Vd dosing schedule. We expect that the reduced exposure provided by the SVd dosing schedule may significantly reduce common Velcade®- and dexamethasone-related toxicities, which is consistent with the safety data from the 42 patients described above who were treated with SVd on the STOMP study at the recommended dose. For the Vd arm, cross-over to the SVd arm based on objective progression will be permitted. The primary endpoints of the study are ORR and PFS and key secondary endpoints include DOR, OS, and certain other duration and quality of life endpoints. Top-line data from the Phase 3 BOSTON study is anticipated in 2019. 
 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma 
 NHL is a cancer that starts in cells called lymphocytes, which are part of the bodys immune system. Lymphocytes are found in the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues, such as the spleen and bone marrow, as well as in the blood. DLBCL is the most common and the most aggressive of the different forms of NHL. We estimate that approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with DLBCL in the United States each year, with approximately 10,000 deaths per year. Approximately 50% of newly diagnosed patients are currently cured with front-line (typically R-CHOP chemotherapy) and another approximately 10% of patients are cured with second line intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The remaining patients generally succumb to the disease, with the median overall survival of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after two prior regimens less than one year, and often less than six months. Despite the recent approval of CAR-T therapy, many patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL are not be medically stable enough to undergo CAR-T therapy and have no new or targeted agents approved for the treatment of their disease. 
 SADAL: Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Selinexor in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma 
 Our Selinexor Against Diffuse Aggressive Lymphoma, or SADAL, study is an open-label Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating single-agent oral selinexor in patients that have relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL, either de novo or transformed from a more indolent NHL such as follicular lymphoma, after two to five lines of therapy. At least 50% of patients on SADAL will have the GCB subtype of DLBCL, which represents a particularly high unmet medical need given the lack of available therapies for patients with this relapsed/refractory subtype. The SADAL study had been conducted as a two-arm study with patients randomized on a one-to-one basis to receive either 100mg or 60mg of selinexor, each given twice weekly, with about 200 patients expected to be randomized evenly between the two arms with an inclusion requirement of least 14 weeks since a patients last systemic anti-DLBCL therapy. The primary endpoint would be ORR on each arm, with the goal of determining the more optimal dose for patients with heavily pretreated DLBCL. 
 In early 2017, we reported efficacy data to the FDA across both the 100mg and 60mg arms in the first 63 patients with consistent response rates across both arms (adjudicated by independent central radiological 
 
18 
 
 committee per protocol), but greater durability and chronic tolerability were observed in the 60mg arm. The FDA agreed that the change to a single-arm study was reasonable and that the proposed trial design and indication appeared appropriate for accelerated approval, though the availability of accelerated approval will depend on the trial results and available therapies at the time of regulatory action. Therefore, in consultation with the FDA, we amended the SADAL study to become a single-arm study evaluating single-agent selinexor at 60mg given twice weekly and to make other protocol amendments, including to reduce the 14-week washout period to 60 days in patients who achieved at least a PR on their most recent therapy; patients with stable disease (SD) on their most recent therapy still require the 14-week washout period. 
 In June 2017, we reported updated results from the SADAL study at the 2017 European Hematology Association (EHA) annual meeting. Across the 90 patients enrolled in SADAL as of May 15, 2017, the median number of prior treatment regimens was three (range of two to five prior treatment regimens). Based on the intention-to-treat analysis of the first 63 patients and as adjudicated by an independent central radiological review committee, as of May 15, 2017, 21 patients responded (nine patients having a CR and 12 patients with a PR) for an ORR of 33%. An additional six patients experienced SD, for a disease control rate (DCR) of 43%. The median DOR across all patients was greater than seven months and responses tended to occur rapidly with a median of two months to onset. Among patients who responded, the median time on treatment was nine months with a follow up of 12.8 months. Nine patients who responded remained on treatment as of the data cutoff date, including six patients with a CR. The median overall survival was eight months for all patients on the study. Median survival for the patients with PR or CR had not been reached and is over nine months. Consistent with published survival data in this population and a lack of effective alternative therapeutic options, the median survival for patients with SD, PD or non-evaluable was 4.8 months. 
 Selinexor also demonstrated robust, single-agent activity against both GCB and non-GCB subtypes of DLBCL. Of the 32 patients with DLBCL of the GCB-subtype, nine responded (four patients having a CR, five patients having a PR) for an ORR of 28%. Of the 31 patients with DLBCL of the non-GCB (or ABC)-subtype, 12 responded (five patients with a CR, seven patients with a PR) for an ORR of 39%. 
 Among the 90 patients evaluated for safety, the most common AEs across both dosing groups were fatigue (61%), nausea (51%), thrombocytopenia (50%), anorexia (49%), vomiting (31%) and anemia (30%), and were primarily Grades 1 and 2 and were managed with dose modifications and/or standard supportive care. As expected, the most common Grade 3 and 4 AEs in the 60mg arm were thrombocytopenia (28%), neutropenia (17%), anemia (15%), and fatigue (11%) and were manageable with dose modifications and/or standard supportive care. 
 The SADAL study is expected to enroll a total of approximately 130 patients at the 60 mg twice weekly dose, and we anticipate announcing top-line data for the completed study by the end of 2018. Additional studies of selinexor in combination with standard DLBCL treatments are ongoing or are being planned, and we anticipate that one or more of these studies will inform the design of a randomized phase 3 study to be initiated in the future. 
 Investigator-Sponsored Trials 
 Ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of selinexor in combination with existing therapies to treat various lymphomas: (i) rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide, or R-ICE, and selinexor to treat relapsed (at least one prior therapy) DLBCL and other aggressive lymphomas, (ii) ibrutinib and selinexor to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia or NHL, and (iii) R-DHaOx and R-GDP in combination with selinexor in relapsed refractory B-cell lymphomas including DLBCL. 
 Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
 AML in elderly populations remains a vexing clinical problem with limited progress in the last decade. There are limited treatment agents approved for patients that are ineligible for standard intensive chemotherapy. 
 
19 
 
 AML is a cancer that starts in the bone marrow and in most cases quickly moves into the blood. The incidence of AML dramatically increases after the age of 55. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 19,500 new cases of AML, most of which will be in adults, will be diagnosed in the United States in 2018, with approximately 10,600 deaths from AML in the United States in 2018. Approximately 40% of AML patients are young enough with sufficient major organ function to undergo stem cell transplantation for their AML, and approximately 50% of these patients can be cured of their disease. Therefore, approximately 20% of adults with AML are currently curable. Those who are not cured, and those patients who are elderly or unfit for transplant, have a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than one year. Recently, selective inhibitors of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 or 2) proteins have been developed for the approximately 20% of patients whose AML harbors these mutations, and a liposomal fixed-dose formulation of standard chemotherapy agents for patients with secondary AML have been developed and/or approved. However, for the majority of patients with AML, there remains no effective treatment. Moreover, prognosis worsens continuously with advancing age to a median survival of as low as one month for those who are older than 85 years of age. 
 SOPRA: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Selinexor vs. Physicians Choice in Elderly AML 
 Our Phase 2 study of oral selinexor in patients 60 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML enrolled patients who were ineligible for standard intensive chemotherapy and/or transplantation. In our Selinexor in Older Patient with Relapsed/ Refractory AML (SOPRA) study, we enrolled 176 patients who have AML that has relapsed after, or was refractory to, first line therapy. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to selinexor provided orally twice weekly in a dose of 60mg plus best supportive care (BSC) versus one of three physician choices (PC). SOPRA enrolled 176 patients, with a median of two prior treatment regimens. In March 2017, we reported that we had determined, in concert with SOPRAs independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), that the study would not reach statistical significance for showing superiority of OS on selinexor versus OS on PC, the studys primary endpoint. Based on unaudited site data, among patients on the selinexor arm, 13% demonstrated a CR with or without full hematologic recovery (CRi), compared to 3% of patients on the PC control arm. Some patients remained on selinexor for over one year, but this did not result in a statistically superior OS compared to the PC arm. However, since the 13% of selinexor-treated patients who achieved a CR (with or without full hematologic recovery) showed a substantial OS benefit as compared with the PC arm, we and the DSMB agreed that patients would be permitted to continue on the selinexor arm or the PC arm, as applicable, following discussion between the patient and their treating physician. 
 The DSMB found no new clinically significant AEs in the patients receiving selinexor. Rates of sepsis and febrile neutropenia (FN) were lower on the selinexor arm than the PC arm: on selinexor, the rate of sepsis was 4.9% versus 6.1% for the PC arm; the rate of FN on selinexor was 14.7% versus 36.4% on the PC arm. As expected, the most common selinexor-related AEs were nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. 
 We plan to continue clinical development of selinexor in AML through investigator-sponsored trials in multiple combination regimens, including with chemotherapy, given data to date across these settings. 
 Investigator-Sponsored Trials 
 SAIL: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Selinexor, Ara-C and Idarubicin in AML 
 In December 2016, Walter Fiedler, MD of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany and his colleagues presented updated data from the SAIL study, an investigator-sponsored trial evaluating the combination of selinexor, Ara-C and idarubicin in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Patients in this study had a range of one to five prior therapies and 39% had undergone a prior stem cell transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion. Data from 42 patients evaluable for safety (range of prior treatment regimens, all including intensive chemotherapy is 1-5), as of October 2016, demonstrated an ORR of 55% (with 4 patients excluded from evaluation due to early death) and included CR of 22% and 36% and CRi of 33% and 9% in Cohort 1 and 2, respectively. Median relapse free survival was 333 days and median OS was 435 days. 
 
20 
 
The most frequent Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic AEs of this intensive chemotherapy-containing regimen were diarrhea (50%) and nausea (12%). The most common Grade 3 or higher hematologic AEs were neutropenia (100%) and thrombocytopenia (100%) as expected with any intensive chemotherapy regimen. Two deaths occurred that were deemed possibly treatment-related, which were one reported case of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; 2%) and one reported case of hemophagocytosis syndrome (2%). Other Ara-C-based combination therapies for AML have shown significantly lower response rates in patients with heavily pretreated AML: combination of Ara-C with Mylotarg® (gemtuzumab ozogamicin)  11.5% ORR; combination of Ara-C with doxorubicin (Doxil®)  6.9%. We believe the combination of selinexor with chemotherapy is a promising regimen, particularly in this difficult-to-treat patient population with poor prognoses. Approximately half of patients on the SAIL study were able to proceed to their first or second allogeneic stem cell translation. Ara-C and idarubicin represent the standard of care for AML patients who are candidates for intensive therapy, and the SAIL study provides support for the tolerability of selinexor in combination with standard of care therapy. Accordingly, we believe that selinexor in combination with Ara-C and idarubicin may be an effective treatment option and serve as a bridge to stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. 
 Additional investigator-sponsored studies are evaluating the safety and efficacy of selinexor as a single agent and in combination with existing therapies: (i) daunorubicin, cytarabine and selinexor in patients with high risk, naïve AML, (ii) topoisomerase-II inhibition and selinexor in AML, (iii) sorafenib and selinexor in AML, (iv) cladribine and cytarabine, or CLAG, and selinexor in AML, (v) high dose cytarabine, or HiDAC, mitoxantrone chemotherapy and selinexor for remission induction in AML, (vi) decitabine and selinexor in AML, (vii) fludarabine, cytarabine and selinexor in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia or MDS, (viii) single-agent selinexor to eliminate minimal residual disease and maintain remission in patients with AML and high risk MDS after allogenic stem cell transplant and (ix) single-agent selinexor in MDS. 
 Eighteen pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia were enrolled in the investigator-sponsored SELHEM (Selinexor with Fludarabine and Cytarabine for Treatment of Refractory or Relapsed Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome) clinical trial. Data from this study were presented in May 2016 at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Annual Meeting and published in August 2016 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In the SELHEM study, selinexor was given orally six times per 28-day cycle. Among the 17 patients who were evaluable for toxicity, three were treated with selinexor at 30mg/m2, three at 40mg/m2, six at 55mg/m2, and five at 70mg/m2. Fludarabine (30mg/m2) and cytarabine (2g/m2) were each administered twice during each 28-day cycle. 
 In this group of heavily pretreated, relapsed and/or refractory patients, seven of 15 evaluable patients (47%) achieved CR or CRi. Five of the responses were negative for minimal residual disease, or MRD. Two patients experienced MRD negative CRs within the first cycle after receiving only oral selinexor therapy. The most common Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity was asymptomatic hyponatremia. Two patients who were treated with selinexor at 70mg/m2 experienced reversible cerebellar toxicity, thereby defining the dose-limiting toxicity. The SELHEM study concluded that selinexor, in combination with fludarabine and cytarabine, is tolerable at doses up to 55mg/m2 in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Given the promising response rates, further exploration of this combination is expected in a Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Malignancies 
 Solid tumors represent the vast majority of cancer incidences. Given the large patient population with solid tumors and the mechanistic activity of selinexor that makes it potentially suitable for treating any type of cancer, we are developing selinexor to potentially play a meaningful role across multiple solid tumor indications, either alone or in combination as a backbone therapy. We have seen encouraging single agent data for selinexor in a variety of solid tumors including PRs and durable SD with disease control greater than three months. Our Phase 1b study in patients with liposarcoma and other sarcomas demonstrated durable SD with single-agent selinexor, and our Phase 2 studies of selinexor in gynecological malignancies and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) also 
 
21 
 
 demonstrated anti-cancer activity and disease control. Given the promising single-agent activity in difficult-to-treat indications and the potential to enhance activity in combination with existing therapies, we plan to evaluate opportunities to develop selinexor in unmet needs like certain gynecological malignancies or GBM, and to advance combination therapy development with both standard of care and emerging therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
 SEAL: Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Selinexor vs. Placebo in Liposarcoma 
 Liposarcoma represents an area of high unmet need with limited treatment options. Liposarcoma arises from fat cells or their precursors and represents up to 18% of all soft tissue sarcoma, or approximately 2,500 new cases per year in the United Sates. Liposarcoma most commonly occurs in the thigh, behind the knee, the groin, the gluteal area or behind the abdominal cavity. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is an aggressive form of soft tissue sarcoma that is resistant to both standard chemotherapy and radiation. Liposarcoma has a particularly high rate of recurrence following surgery, especially in cases involving the abdomen. Except for cases that are cured with surgery, most patients with metastatic liposarcoma will succumb to this disease, and novel therapies are needed. 

In our Phase 1b trial to evaluate the effects of food and formulation on selinexor pharmacokinetics in patients with soft-tissue or bone sarcoma, 31 of 54 sarcoma patients (57%) experienced SD with single-agent selinexor treatment. Of the 18 patients with liposarcoma, 14 (78%) experienced SD and eight (44%) experienced SD of four months or longer. Fifteen of these 18 patients with liposarcoma had dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Of these 15 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, 13 (87%) experienced SD and seven (47%) experienced SD of four months or longer. 
 In light of the Phase 1b data, we are conducting the Selinexor in Advanced Liposarcoma (SEAL) study, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating single-agent oral selinexor in patients with advanced unresectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma who received at least one line of prior systemic therapy. Patients are randomized to receive either 60mg of selinexor or placebo given twice weekly until progression or intolerability. In September 2017, we reported a successful outcome from the Phase 2 portion of the SEAL study (57 patients). For the studys primary endpoint of PFS, selinexor showed superiority over placebo, achieving a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6, representing a 40% reduction in the risk of progression or death. PFS was assessed by an Independent Central Radiological Review (ICRR) based on RECIST v1.1. In this randomized, blinded Phase 2 portion of the study, selinexor demonstrated an expected and manageable safety profile, primarily with nausea, anorexia and fatigue and low levels of Grade 3/4 cytopenias, and no new or unexpected safety signals were identified. The majority of treatment-related AEs were low grade and reversible with dose modifications and/or standard supportive care. Importantly, the incidence of infections in the selinexor arm (overall 29%; Grade 3 or higher, 0%) was less than that reported in the placebo arm (overall 39%; Grade 3 or higher, 19%). Additional efficacy assessments included PFS by World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria, effects on metabolic parameters via PET Scans, and PFS according to Choi Criteria. PFS per WHO criteria achieved a HR of 0.84; the WHO response criteria will not be included as part of the Phase 3 study objectives. 
 The Phase 3 portion of the SEAL study, which was originally initiated in North America, is ongoing and has been expanded to include Europe. In this blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, up to 222 patients are expected to be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to receive either oral selinexor (60mg twice weekly) until disease progression or intolerability, or placebo. Patients whose disease progresses on placebo will be permitted to cross over to the selinexor arm. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 portion of the study is PFS as assessed by the ICRR based on RECIST v1.1. The Phase 3 study design and primary endpoint of PFS were agreed to by the FDA. Top-line data from the Phase 3 portion of the SEAL study are anticipated by the end of 2019. Assuming a positive outcome, these data are intended to support a NDA for oral selinexor as a potential new treatment for patients with advanced unresectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

SIENDO: Investigator-Sponsored Randomized Phase 3 Trial of Maintenance Selinexor/Placebo After Combination Chemotherapy In Patients with Advanced or Recurrent ENDOmetrial Cancer 
 SIENDO is an investigator-sponsored Phase 3 trial of maintenance with selinexor or placebo after combination chemotherapy for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. The overall objective is to obtain conclusive evidence of efficacy for maintenance selinexor in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. This is a multi-center/multinational trial expected to enroll 160 patients. 
 This investigator-sponsored trial was designed based on the data from our SIGN study, a Phase 2, open-label study of efficacy and safety of oral selinexor in patients with heavily pre-treated, progressive gynecological cancers. In October 2016, we presented updated data at the 2016 ESMO annual meeting that showed selinexors promising anti-tumor activity and disease control in gynecological malignancies. Of the 59 evaluable patients with ovarian cancer, 29 met the primary endpoint (8 patients (14%) achieved a confirmed PR and 21 patients achieved SD for at least 12 weeks), for a DCR of 49%. Median PFS for the ovarian cancer arm was three months and median OS was seven months. Of the 20 evaluable patients with endometrial cancer, nine met the primary endpoint (three confirmed PRs and six with SD for 12 or more weeks), for a DCR of 45%. Median PFS for the endometrial cancer arm was three months and median OS was eight months. Across all arms, the most common Grade 2 or 3 AEs were fatigue, nausea, anemia, anorexia, vomiting, weight loss and thrombocytopenia, which were manageable with supportive care and dose modifications. Notably, Grade 3 AEs were significantly reduced in patients with ovarian cancer receiving once weekly dosing compared to twice weekly dosing. One incidence of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia without bleeding was also reported. For the 44 patients achieved at least SD for at least 12 weeks, the median time on study was 20 weeks. Fifteen patients remained on single-agent selinexor for greater than 6 months, including 4 patients continuing on treatment for greater than 12 months. 
KING: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Selinexor in Glioblastoma Multiforme 
 The KING study is a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral selinexor in patients with recurrent GBM. In June 2016, we presented data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting where we showed that single-agent oral selinexor demonstrated anti-tumor activity in patients with glioblastoma that recurred after temozolomide and radiation therapy, including selinexor brain penetration at clinically relevant levels, leading to durable anti-cancer activity and disease control of up to 6 months. Specifically, data as of May 23, 2016 from 33 surgically ineligible patients with GBM that progressed after treatment with temozolomide and radiation showed that selinexor dosed twice weekly at 50mg/m2 demonstrated anti-tumor activity with a 12% ORR (PR or better) and a 33% DCR (SD or better) with durability of up to six months in two patients. The most common AEs were thrombocytopenia, fatigue, anorexia, and nausea. 
 Investigator-Sponsored Trials 
 Investigator-sponsored clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of selinexor as a single agent and in combination with existing therapies: (i) selinexor, paclitaxel and carboplatin in ovarian or endometrial malignancies, (ii) selinexor and standard chemotherapy agents in advanced solid tumors, (iii) selinexor in genomic profiling and matched therapy for recurrent or metastatic salivary gland neoplasms, (iv) selinexor in Asian patients with advanced malignancies and (v) selinexor in recurrent refractory pediatric solid tumors. 
 Our Other Pipeline Programs 
 Eltanexor (KPT-8602)
Eltanexor is a second-generation SINE compound that, like selinexor, selectively blocks the nuclear export protein XPO1. The mechanism of action for the biological (anti-cancer) activity of eltanexor is believed to be the same as selinexor. 
 Eltanexor differs from selinexor primarily because it has much lower penetration into the brain and, therefore, may cause fewer side effects such as nausea, fatigue and anorexia. Following oral administration, 
 
23 
 
 animals treated with eltanexor show lower percentage of body weight loss and improved food consumption, as well as less fatigue behavior, in comparison to animals similarly treated with selinexor. This allows more frequent dosing of eltanexor, enabling a longer period of exposure at higher levels than is possible with selinexor. In many preclinical model systems, the more intensive dosing regimen leads to superior efficacy in comparison to selinexor treatment. As a result, we believe that eltanexor represents a second-generation SINE compound and are evaluating safety, tolerability and efficacy in humans. 
 We initiated our first-in-humans Phase 1/2 clinical trial for eltanexor in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in January 2016. At the 2017 ASH annual meeting, we reported positive data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study demonstrating good tolerability and promising activity in MM. Using a 3+3 dose escalation design, oral eltanexor (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40mg) was dosed once daily for five days per week or once every other day for three days each week (60mg) for a 28-day cycle. Patients with less than a minimal response after one cycle or partial response after two cycles were permitted to add dexamethasone. Of the 34 evaluable patients, 14 received dexamethasone with their eltanexor regimen from the first day of the first cycle. Objective responses correlated with longer overall survival and all patients with a VGPR or PR were still alive or censored as of the data cutoff date. Deeper and faster responses were observed when dexamethasone was started on Day 1 of Cycle 1 versus a delayed start. Among the 35 patients evaluable for M-protein, 25 patients (71%) had reductions in M-protein. The median time on treatment for the overall study population was greater than 96 days, with a range of 10 to 441 days. 
 Among the 39 patients evaluable for safety, the most common Grade 1/2 AEs were nausea (54%), fatigue (46%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (38%), dysgeusia (33%), weight loss (33%) and neutropenia (31%). As expected in this patient population, the most common Grade 3/4 AEs were thrombocytopenia (56%), neutropenia (26%), anemia (15%), leukopenia (15%) and hyponatremia (10%). Importantly, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting were nearly all Grade 1, manageable and transient, and bleeding was uncommon. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached; however, dose escalation was halted as responses were achieved. Based on these data, the RP2D has been established as 20mg eltanexor dosed five times per week with 20mg dexamethasone dosed twice weekly.   This Phase 1/2 study has been expanded to include patients with high risk MDS, advanced CRC or mCRPC. These are indications where selinexor and XPO1 inhibition has shown clear activity, but where side effects such as fatigue and anorexia were problematic for patients due to the underlying malignancies. We believe eltanexor has the potential to control malignancies in these indications with a favorable side effect profile. 
 KPT-9274
KPT-9274 is a first-in-class orally bioavailable small molecule that is a non-competitive dual modulator of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; also known as PBEF or visfatin). Co-inhibition of these targets leads to synergistic anti-tumor effects through energy depletion, inhibition of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of proliferation, and ultimately apoptosis. Normal cells are more resistant to inhibition by KPT-9274 due in part to their relative genomic stability and lower metabolic rates. Hematologic and solid tumor cells become dependent on both PAK4 and NAMPT pathways and are therefore susceptible to single-agent cytotoxic effect of KPT-9274.
PAK4 is a signaling protein regulating numerous fundamental cellular processes, including several involved in the development of cancer. PAK4 interacts with key signaling molecules involved in cancer such as beta-catenin, CDC42, Raf-1, BAD and myosin light chain. 
 NAMPT is a pleiotropic protein with multiple intra- and extra-cellular functions that can be found in complex with PAK4 in the cell. NAMPT is of interest as an oncology target because it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in one of the two intracellular salvage pathways that generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a universal energy- and signal-carrying molecule involved in mitochondrial function and energy 
 
24 
 
 metabolism, as well as in DNA repair (through Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase, or PARP) and epigenetics (through sirtuims, or SIRTs). An alternate salvage pathway utilizes the rate-limiting enzyme NAPRT1 to convert nicotinic acid or niacin into NAD. NAPRT1 is often silenced through promoter hypermethylation in tumor samples while it remains expressed in normal tissues. Patients that have NAPRT1 negative tumors may be able to benefit from niacin co-dosing to alleviate KPT-9274 adverse effects while maintaining inhibitory activity in their tumors. Therefore, patients can be stratified according to their NAPRT1 tumor status. 
 KPT-9274 has shown broad evidence of anti-cancer activity against hematological and solid tumor malignant cells while showing minimal toxicity to normal cells in vitro. In mouse xenograft studies, KPT-9274 given orally has shown evidence of anti-cancer activity and tolerability. To our knowledge, we are the only company with an allosteric, PAK4 and/or NAMPT specific inhibitor currently in clinical development. 
 We initiated a first-in-humans Phase 1 open-label clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KPT-9274 in patients with advanced solid malignancies or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Top-line results from this Phase 1 study were presented in September 2017 at the ESMO annual meeting. Among the 18 patients evaluable for preliminary efficacy, there were six (33%) with SD, the longest for 7.3 months. Tumor reductions (shrinkage of 3.9%, 13.6% and 22.6%) were observed in three out of three patients (100%) with NAPRT1 deficient tumors. Among the 21 patients evaluated for safety, the most common Grade 2 AEs across dose levels were arthralgia (43%), anemia (24%) and fatigue (24%). The most common drug-related Grade 3 or higher AEs across dose levels include anemia (38%) and fatigue (5%). Gastrointestinal-related AEs were infrequent and low grade. In addition, it was determined that niacin can be safely administered with KPT-9274 and may improve tolerability, particularly with respect to anemia. Dose escalation remains ongoing and further evaluation of effects in NAPRT1 deficient tumors is planned. Enrollment is planned to continue based on the patients NAPRT1 status in a 2:1 ratio (NAPRT1- : NAPRT1+). These study findings indicate that in patients whose disease has progressed despite most available therapies, KPT-9274 can induce tumor shrinkage and disease stabilization. 
 Verdinexor (KPT-335): Oral SINE Compound for Lymphoma in Companion Canines
We have used spontaneously occurring canine cancers as a surrogate model for human malignancies. It is widely known that canine lymphomas display a comparable genetic profile and respond to chemotherapy in a fashion similar to their human counterparts (human NHL, most closely DLBCL). Lymphomas are one of the most common tumors in pet dogs. Lymphoma in dogs is very aggressive and, without treatment, the tumors are often fatal within weeks. The majority of dog lymphomas are DLBCL and most of the others are T-cell lymphomas. Given the similarities of dog and human lymphomas, prior to initiating clinical trials of selinexor in humans, we investigated verdinexor (KPT-335), a closely-related, orally available SINE compound in pet dogs with lymphomas. We have received a Minor Use / Minor Species (MUMS) designation from the FDAs Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed or first relapse after chemotherapy lymphomas in pet dogs with verdinexor. 
 Several different dog tumor cell lines, including those derived from lymphomas, exhibited growth inhibition and apoptosis in vitro upon exposure to nanomolar concentrations of verdinexor. Data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of verdinexor as well as dose expansion study involving pet dogs with cancer, primarily with lymphoma, show efficacy of verdinexor to treat dogs with lymphoma. Side effects included anorexia, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea and were manageable with dose modulation and supportive care. We conducted an owner observation-based survey and the data indicated that the overall quality of life did not change significantly in dogs treated with verdinexor. Based on these findings, a Phase 2b clinical trial, intended to support regulatory approval under the MUMS designation in the United States, was performed in 58 pet dogs with either newly-diagnosed or first relapse after chemotherapy lymphomas. In this Phase 2b clinical trial, Verdinexor was administered initially at doses ranging from 25mg/m2 to 30mg/m2 two or three days per week. Minimal or no supportive care was given. The total CRs and PRs of the 58 dogs was 34%, with one CR and 19 PRs. An additional 33 of 58 dogs (57%) experienced SD for at least four weeks. The median time to disease progression 
 
25 
 
 was approximately five weeks, with 20 dogs (34%) remaining on study for longer than eight weeks. A few dogs that received verdinexor in the Phase 1 or 2b studies remained on therapy for longer than eight months. We submitted the safety and effectiveness sections of a New Animal Drug Application for verdinexor to the CVM in December 2013. 
 In May 2017, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Anivive Lifesciences (Anivive), a privately-held biotech company focused on innovations in the veterinary drug and bioinformatics space, pursuant to which Anivive received worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize verdinexor for the treatment of cancer in companion animals. In exchange, we received an upfront payment and are eligible to receive future milestone payments and royalties. If approved, we believe that verdinexor would represent the first oral, targeted therapy for the treatment of dog lymphoma. 
 Our Non-Oncology Drug Candidates 
 Verdinexor (KPT-335): Oral SINE Compound for Viral, Rare Disease and Autoimmune Indications
Verdinexor (KPT-335) is an oral SINE compound and our lead compound that is being evaluated as a potential therapy for viral, rare disease and autoimmune indications, in addition to the canine lymphoma program described above. Several viruses exclusively utilize XPO1 to shuttle cargos necessary for viral replication, such as viral and host proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Due to the stability of host gene targets compared to viruses which rapidly adapt for best fitness in hosts, targeting host genes may offer an approach to limit drug resistance. We intend to extend preclinical research in viruses that may be relevant to patients with compromised immune systems, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Epstein Barr Virus. 
 In addition to viral indications, we plan to study verdinexor in preclinical models of various rare diseases such as Rett syndrome, Leishmania and Trypanosoma. We believe the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of SINE compounds could benefit patients in these difficult to treat rare diseases. We also plan to study verdinexor in autoimmune indications. We believe autoimmune diseases are a rational target for verdinexor as elevated XPO1 function appears to contribute to disease pathology in indications with dysregulated inflammatory processes, such as Lupus. 
 In 2015, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of verdinexor in healthy human volunteers in Australia. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of verdinexor in healthy adult subjects. Verdinexor was found to be generally safe and well tolerated. Mild to moderate AEs of similar number and grade as placebo were reported, and no serious or severe AEs were observed. We plan to continue to explore strategies to pursue the clinical development of verdinexor as a treatment for viral, rare disease and autoimmune indications, including potentially partnering with a collaborator or through government-funded grant or contract opportunities. 
 Our Strategic Relationships 
 On January 24, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Biogen pursuant to which Biogen acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our oral SINE compound KPT-350 and certain related assets with an initial focus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. KPT-350 is an IND-ready oral SINE compound with a preclinical data package supporting potential efficacy across a number of neurological, autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of multiple proteins that impact neurological, autoimmune and inflammatory processes. Consequently, inhibition of XPO1 by KPT-350 results in a reduction in autoimmunity and inflammation and an increase in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. KPT-350 penetrates the blood brain barrier to a greater degree than other SINE compounds. Preclinical data generated largely by external collaborators show efficacy of KPT-350 and related SINE compounds in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. We received a one-time upfront payment of $10 million 
 
26 
 
 from Biogen and are eligible to receive additional payments of up to $207 million based on the achievement by Biogen of future specified development and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments that reach low double digits based on future net sales until the later of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product or the expiration of specified patent protection for the applicable product, determined on a county-by-country basis. 
 Effective October 11, 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ono), whereby Ono received rights to develop and commercialize selinexor and eltanexor (KPT-8602), at its own cost and expense, for the diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of all human oncology indications in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and ASEAN countries, which we refer to as the Ono Territory. In exchange, we received a one-time upfront payment of ¥2.5 billion (approximately US$21.9 million) from Ono and retain all rights to selinexor and eltanexor outside the Ono Territory. We are eligible to receive up to an additional ¥19.15 billion (approximately US$170.7 million at the exchange rate on the effective date of the agreement) if specified future development and commercial milestones are achieved by Ono. We are also eligible to receive low double-digit royalties based on future net sales of selinexor and eltanexor in the Ono Territory. Ono will have the ability to participate in any global clinical study of selinexor and eltanexor and will bear the cost and expense for patients enrolled in clinical studies in the Ono Territory. 
 In May 2017, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Anivive, pursuant to which Anivive received worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize verdinexor for the treatment of cancer in companion animals. In exchange, we received an upfront payment of $1.0 million and a subsequent milestone of $250,000 and are eligible to receive up to $43.25 million in future regulatory, clinical and commercial milestone payments, assuming approval in both the United States and the European Union. In addition, Anivive agreed to pay us up to low double-digit royalty payments based on future net sales of verdinexor. If approved, we believe that verdinexor would represent the first oral, targeted therapy for the treatment of dog lymphoma. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, our core technologies, and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions related to our proprietary technology and drug candidates. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. 
 We file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use and manufacture for our drug candidates. As of March 1, 2018, we were the sole owner of 10 patents in the United States and we had 12 pending patent applications in the United States, four pending international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), 31 granted patents and 123 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing a single initial patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the member states. Although a PCT application is not itself examined and cannot issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. The technology underlying such pending patent applications has been developed by us and was not acquired from any in-licensing agreement. 
 The intellectual property portfolios for our key drug candidates as of March 1, 2018 are summarized below.

Any patents that may issue in the United States based on the pending U.S. non-provisional applications will expire in 2033 for the earliest filed application and 2034, 2035 or 2036 for the remaining applications, absent any terminal disclaimer, patent term adjustment due to administrative delays by the USPTO or patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Any patents that may issue based on the pending foreign patent applications will likewise expire in 2033, 2034 or 2036. Foreign patent applications covering the composition of matter and methods of use of KPT-9274 have been filed in 21 countries/regions. Any patents that may issue in the United States based on the pending PCT applications will expire in 2036, absent any terminal disclaimer, patent term adjustment due to administrative delays by the USPTO or patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Any patents issued in foreign jurisdictions will likewise expire in 2036.

 In addition to the patent portfolios covering our key drug candidates, as of March 1, 2018, our patent portfolio also includes four patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,513,230, 9,303,000, 9,428,490 and 9,550,757) and 17 granted foreign patents and pending patent applications in the U.S., PCT and foreign jurisdictions relating to other XPO1 inhibitors and their use in targeted therapeutics. We also filed three Intent to Use Trademark Applications on August 29, 2013 covering our name, our logo and the two used together. Marks for the name and name and logo together were registered in the United States on January 20, 2015 as Registration Nos. 4,676,255 
 
28 
 
 and 4,676,226. The mark for our logo was registered in the United States on February 24, 2015 as Registration No. 4,693,107. As of March 1, 2018, we also have eleven pending Intent to Use Trademark Applications in the United States and a registration for PORE for our online portal. We have also filed applications for six drug names for selinexor outside the United States in sixteen jurisdictions, some of which have been registered. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. See Government RegulationPatent Term Restoration and Extension below for additional information on such extensions. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug candidate and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators requiring assignment of inventions. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with a third party. 
 With respect to our proprietary drug discovery and optimization platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We anticipate that with respect to this technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how may over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and 
 
29 
 
 biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are several companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer and the other indications on which we currently plan to focus, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. To our knowledge, only one other company with an XPO1 inhibitor has enrolled patients in clinical trials at the present time. Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. announced in January 2015 that it had exclusively licensed the rights to develop and commercialize SL-801, an oral XPO1 inhibitor, from CanBas Co., Ltd. In December 2015, Stemline announced the opening of its IND and planned initiation of a clinical development program in multiple cancer types. Stemline currently has a Phase 1 trial that is open and enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors with a projected primary completion date of October 2018, and it has indicated that it is planning a Phase 1 trial in hematologic malignancies. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the availability of generic chemotherapy and other cancer therapies and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. Generic drugs for the treatment of cancer and the other indications on which we currently plan to initially focus are currently on the market, and additional drugs are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over generic versions of older chemotherapy agents and other cancer therapies. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our drug candidates may compete with many existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our drug candidates will be complimentary with them. Some of the currently-approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely-accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. 
 In addition to currently-marketed therapies, there are also a number of drugs in late stage clinical development to treat cancer and the other indications on which we plan to initially focus. These drugs in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently-marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 
30 
 
If our lead drug candidates are approved for the indications of our initial focus, they may compete with the investigational therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 Multiple Myeloma (MM) 
 Over the past 12 years, ten agents have been approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with MM: Velcade® (bortezomib, Takeda), Revlimid® (lenalidomide, Celgene), Thalomid® (thalidomide, Celgene), Doxil® (liposomal doxorubicin, Janssen), Kyprolis® (carfilzomib, Amgen), Pomalyst® (pomalidomide, Celgene), Farydak® (panobinostat, Novartis), Darzalex® (daratumumab, Janssen), Empliciti® (elotuzumab, BMS), and Ninlaro® (ixazomib, Takeda). Approved indications range from the treatment of newly diagnosed patients to those with relapsed and/or refractory MM. 
 Several other anti-cancer agents are in late-stage development for the treatment of patients with MM, including anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), based CAR-T therapies such as bb2121 (Bluebird Bio/Celgene), JCHARHI25 (Juno Therapeutics/Celgene), P-BCMA-101 (Johnson & Johnson/Poseida Therapeutics), LCAR-B38M (Johnson & Johnson/Legend BioTech) and CART-BCMA (Novartis); monocolonal antibodies such as isatuximab (Sanofi); bi-specific antibodies such as GSK2857916 (GlaxoSmithKline) and PF-06863135 (Pfizer); and other novel agents such as ibrutinib (Abbvie/Roche), venetoclax (Abbvie), plitidepsin (PharMar), masitinib (AB Sciences), Opdivo® (nivolumab, BMS), filanesib (Array Biopharma), ricolinostat (Celgene) and melflufen (Oncopeptides). 
 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) 
 The initial therapy for DLBCL typically consists of multi-agent cytotoxic drugs in combination with the monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, Roche). In patients with DLBCL who are not elderly and who have good organ function, high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation is often used. Newer targeted agents such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (Imbruvica®, Pharmacyclics) and the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide (Revlimid®, Celgene) have shown activity in DLBCL. There are also a number of other widely used anti-cancer agents that have broad labels which include NHL, and some of these are being evaluated alone or in combination for the treatment of patients with DLBCL that have relapsed after treatment with chemotherapy. Other anti-cancer agents are also being evaluated in the treatment of DLBCL, including but not limited to, Gazyva® (obinutuzumab, Roche) Afinitor® (everolimus, Novartis), Revlimid® (lenalidomide, Celgene), Arzerra® (ofatumumab, GSK), Imbruvica® (ibrutinib, Pharmacyclics), venetoclax (Abbvie), acalabrutinib (Acerta Pharma), Opdivo® (nivolumab, BMS) and Adcetris® (brentuximab vendotin, Seattle Genetics). In addition, Yescarta (Kite/Gilead), a CAR-T therapy, has been approved as a treatment for patients with DLBCL and other CAR-T therapies are currently in clinical development. 
 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
 Patients with AML typically are treated with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy, and high-risk patients who enter remission and have a matched donor often receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Because these chemotherapy regimens have marked toxicities, elderly patients with AML are often treated with less intensive chemotherapy regimens or drugs called hypomethylating agents such as Dacogen® (decitabine, Otsuka) or Vidaza® (azacitadine, Celgene). Once elderly patients with AML experience disease progression on their initial treatment, their expected survival is very poor. Because of their advanced age, multiple other medical conditions and requirements for multiple other drugs, the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory AML in elderly persons is complicated. Recently, new therapies for specific subsets of AML patients were approved, including midostaurin (Novartis), Vyxeos/CPX-351 (cytarabine and daunorubicin liposome injection) (Jazz Pharmaceuticals) and IDHIFA® (Celgene/Agios Pharmaceuticals). 
 Competition with XPO1 Inhibitors 
 Drug compounds currently in preclinical studies, if developed and approved, could also be competitive with our drug candidates, if approved. In January 2015, Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. announced that it had exclusively 
 
31 
 
 licensed the rights to develop and commercialize SL-801, an XPO1 inhibitor, from CanBas Co., Ltd. In December 2015, Stemline announced the opening of its IND application and planned initiation of a clinical development program in multiple cancer types. Stemline currently has a Phase 1 trial that is open and enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors with a projected primary completion date of October 2018, and it has indicated that it is planning a Phase 1 trial in hematologic malignancies. Additionally, Kosan Biosciences Inc. (acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) has evaluated compounds derived from leptomycin B in preclinical studies. To our knowledge, the Kosan compounds are not currently being developed and have never entered human studies. 
 With respect to indications other than cancer, there are many currently-marketed therapies and drugs in late-stage clinical development to treat non-oncology indications on which we plan to initially focus development of our XPO1 inhibitors. However, to our knowledge, there are no other XPO1 inhibitors in clinical development for the treatment of any diseases other than cancer, including indications such as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or wound healing. There is no published information on the use of the preclinical compounds that have been developed by Kosan Biosciences or CanBas Co. in models other than cancer. 
 Competition with PAK4/NAMPT Dual Inhibitors 
 Our first-in-class PAK4/NAMPT dual inhibitor KPT-9274, if developed and approved, would compete with currently-marketed therapies and drugs in clinical development to treat cancer. However, there are currently no marketed therapies that selectively target PAK4 and/or NAMPT. Pfizer Inc. developed PF-03758309, a non-selective PAK inhibitor, meaning that this compound inhibited several of the PAK family members, and not solely PAK4, through Phase 1 clinical development, but that compound had poor oral bioavailability in both animals and humans and, to our knowledge, development has been discontinued. We are aware that PAK4 biology is being evaluated preclinically by AstraZeneca plc and Genentech, Inc. (acquired by Roche Holding AG). We are not aware of any PAK4 inhibitors that are in clinical development at the present time. 
 In addition to KPT-9274, we are aware of three NAMPT inhibitors that have advanced into human clinical trials. These compounds include GMX1778 (also known as CHS-828), GMX1777 (water-soluble derivative of GMX1778), and APO866 (also known as FK866 and WK175). To our knowledge development of these inhibitors were discontinued. We are aware that NAMPT biology is being evaluated by Genentech, Inc., Eli Lilly & Company, Millennium/Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., OncoTartis, Inc., Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, and at some academic institutions. We are not aware of any other NAMPT inhibitors in clinical development. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our drug candidates receive marketing approval. We have engaged one third party manufacturer to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient for selinexor for preclinical and clinical testing. We have engaged a separate third-party manufacturer for fill-and-finish services. We obtain our selinexor supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have a long-term supply arrangement in place at this time. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services as a part of our commercialization plans. 
 All of our drug candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.

Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and 
 
33 
 
 animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. In addition, companies usually must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the candidate product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the candidate product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or an NDA. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDAs regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 
34 
 
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee or DSMB. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

Phase 1: | The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease (e.g. cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 2: | The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 3: | The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal studies, which denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug.
---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 4: | Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important 
 
35 
 
 increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2018 is $2,421,495 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to a program fee for fiscal year 2018 of $304,162. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDAs receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for priority review products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. The FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain drug applications, including applications for drugs in a shortage or drugs for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh 
 
36 
 
 the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track products application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall 
 
37 
 
 attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDAs goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy (as defined in the Cures Act) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsors agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drugs clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDAs Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDAs evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. 
 
38 
 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
39 
 
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drugs safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the products prescribing information. In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drugs labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementation regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the distribution of and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCSA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAs previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDAs previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug... 
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred to as the Orange Book. Clinicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDAs designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing clinicians or patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDAs drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of competitor generic therapies or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicants product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the 
 
41 
 
 patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
 

 | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


 | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved products listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDAs internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss 
 
42 
 
 deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with drug sponsors. The legislation requires FDA to meet with drug sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after FDAs receipt of the study plan. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDAs request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another orphan drug under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 
43 
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the products approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension, in connection with any of our product candidates. 
The 21st Century Cures Act 
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases. 
 With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new limited population approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy, thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations. 
 Review and Approval of Animal Drugs in the United States 
 In addition to pursuing approval of our drug candidates for use in human beings, we may also seek approval of certain drug candidates for veterinary applications. As with new drug products for human beings, new animal drugs may not be marketed in the United States until they have been approved by the FDA as safe and effective. The requirements and phases governing approval of a new animal drug are analogous to those for new human drugs. Specifically, the Center for Veterinary Medicine or CVM at FDA is responsible for determining whether a new veterinary product should be approved on the basis of a NADA filed by the applicant. A NADA must contain substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the animal drug, as well as data and controls demonstrating that the product will be manufactured and studied in compliance with, among other things, applicable cGMP and GLP practices. 
 
44 
 
To begin this process, an applicant must file an Investigational New Animal Drug application, or INAD, with the CVM. The applicant will hold a pre-development meeting with the CVM to reach general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for a NADA. In this context, an applicant must submit pivotal protocols to the CVM for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. The applicant will gather and submit data on safety, efficacy and chemistry, manufacturing and controls or CMC to the CVM for review, as below: 
 

Safety: | The design and review of the safety study and the study protocol are completed prior to initiation of the study to help assure that the data generated will meet FDA requirements. These studies are conducted under rigorous quality control, including GLP, to assure integrity of the data. They are designed to clearly define a safety margin, identify any potential safety concerns, and establish a safe dose for the product. This dose and effectiveness is then evaluated in the pivotal field efficacy study where the product is studied in the animal patient population in which the product is intended to be used.
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Efficacy: | Early pilot studies may be done in laboratory cats or dogs to establish effectiveness and the dose range for each product. When an effective dose is established, a study protocol to test the product in real world conditions is developed prior to beginning the study. The pivotal field efficacy study protocol is submitted for review and concurrence prior to study initiation, to help assure that the data generated will meet requirements. This study must be conducted with the formulation of the product that is intended to be commercialized, and is a multi-site, randomized, controlled study, generally with a placebo control.
----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CMC: | To assure that the new animal drug product can be manufactured consistently, FDA will require applicants to provide documentation of the process by which the active ingredient is made and the controls applicable to that process that assure the active ingredient and the formulation of the final commercial product meet certain criteria, including purity and stability. After a product is approved, applicants will be required to communicate with FDA before any changes are made to these procedures or at the manufacturing site. Both the active ingredient and commercial formulations are required to be manufactured at facilities that practice cGMP.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once all data have been submitted and reviewed for each technical sectionsafety, efficacy and CMCthe CVM will issue a technical section complete letter as each section review is completed. When the three letters have been issued, the applicant will compile a draft of the Freedom of Information Summary, the proposed labeling, and all other relevant information, and submit these as an administrative NADA for CVM review. Generally, if there are no deficiencies in the submission, the NADA will be issued within four to six months after submission of the administrative NADA. This review will be conducted according to timelines specified in the Animal Drug User Fee Act. The FDAs basis for approving a NADA is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to the CVMs Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, AEs or unexpected results must also be produced in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements. 
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 To obtain marketing approval of a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various EU member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member states assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 Within this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a generic medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the 
 
46 
 
 reference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC. 
 Hybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was authorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid application may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at the community level. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union 
 Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the EU including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the EU member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each EU member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country. 
 In April 2014, the EU passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the EU, the new EU clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all EU member states. All clinical trials performed in the EU are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. According to the current plans of EMA, the new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable in 2019. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the EU portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned, and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned); strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited 
 
47 
 
 period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
 In the EU, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the EU. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of clinically relevant superiority by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs. 
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 
 As in the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an 
 
48 
 
 EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, including compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to EU Member States laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the products Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the EU. 
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
 
49 
 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a companys revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
50 
 

 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to clinicians and teaching hospitals and clinician ownership and investment interests; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are: 
 

 | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded manufacturers rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
51 
 

 | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. In May 2017, the House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017. Thereafter, the Senate Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the ACA known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the ACA without companion legislation to replace it, and a skinny version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. In addition, the Senate considered proposed healthcare reform legislation known as the Graham-Cassidy bill. None of these measures was passed by the Senate. 
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In October 2017, the President signed a second executive order allowing for the use of association health plans and short-term health insurance, which 
 
52 
 
 may provide fewer health benefits than the plans sold through the ACA exchanges. At the same time, the Trump Administration announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for such CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain. 
 More recently, with the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Congress repealed the individual mandate. The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Further, each chamber of the Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the ACA. Although none of these measures has been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA, during the next Congressional session.
