Item 1. Business
 
Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Thornton, Colorado. We refer to Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. as the “Company,” “CPH,”, “us”, “we” or “our” in this Annual Report, and these designations include our subsidiaries unless we state otherwise. On December 6, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), the Company, formerly known as Concrete Pumping Holdings Acquisition Corp., consummated a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to which it acquired (i) the private operating company formerly called Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. and (ii) the former special purpose acquisition company called Industrea Acquisition Corp (“Industrea”). In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company changed its name to Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. 
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 500 E. 84th Ave., Suite A-5, Thornton, Colorado, 80229. We maintain a website at https://www.concretepumpingholdings.com/. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report.
 
Overview
 
CPH is a leading provider of concrete pumping services and concrete waste management services in the United States (“U.S.”) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) based on fleet size, primarily operating under what we believe are the only established, national concrete pumping brands in both geographies – Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping, Inc. (“Brundage-Bone”) for concrete pumping in the U.S., Camfaud Group Limited (“Camfaud”) in the U.K., and Eco-Pan, Inc. (“Eco-Pan”) for waste management services in both the U.S. and U.K. The Brundage-Bone business was founded in 1983 in Denver, Colorado. Since then, the Company has expanded across the U.S. and U.K. through more than 60 acquisitions. Eco-Pan was founded in 1999 and was acquired by CPH in 2014. In November 2016, we entered the U.K. market through the acquisition of Camfaud and in May 2019, we acquired Capital Pumping LP and its affiliates (“Capital”), a concrete pumping provider based in Texas. The Capital acquisition provided us with complementary assets and operations and significantly expanded our footprint and business in Texas.
 
Concrete pumping is a highly specialized method of concrete placement that requires skilled operators to position a truck-mounted, fully-articulating boom for precise delivery of ready-mix concrete from mixer trucks to placing crews on a construction job site. In addition, proper concrete washout handling is an important area of focus for our Company given rising awareness of environmental factors. We believe that our large fleet of specialized pumping equipment, washout pans and trucks, and highly-trained operators enable us to be the trusted provider of concrete placement and waste management solutions to our customers. We deliver and facilitate substantial labor cost savings, shortened concrete placement times, enhanced worksite safety, and efficient concrete washout containment, and thereby help improve the overall quality of construction projects. As of October 31, 2021, we operated a fleet of approximately 1,300 units of equipment, with approximately 1,300 employees and approximately 140 locations globally.
 
With almost 40 years of experience, we believe we are the only nationally-scaled provider of concrete pumping services in the U.S. and the U.K., with the most comprehensive and reliable fleet and highly-skilled operators to provide quality service. We are especially equipped to support large and technically complex construction projects, which generally command higher price points than smaller projects. In addition, we have actively focused our business on commercial and infrastructure construction projects, while continuing to pursue profitable residential opportunities. Our fleet is capable of handling multiple large projects concurrently, and can be deployed on short-notice across the U.S. and the U.K., thereby allowing us to efficiently allocate resources depending on market conditions to more profitable markets. Our highly complementary Eco-Pan business provides customers with a one-stop solution for their concrete washout needs. We plan to continue establishing additional Eco-Pan locations across the U.S. and the U.K., and further penetrate our existing concrete pumping customer base by cross-selling our Eco-Pan services. 
 
As of October 31, 2021, we estimate our share of the concrete pumping market to be approximately 13% in the U.S. and approximately 34% in the U.K., based on fleet size. In the U.S. and U.K. markets, we serve a large and diverse customer base and as of October 31, 2021, our top ten customers represented less than 10% of our total revenue and had an average tenure of more than 20 years.

Segments
 
We operate through the following four reportable segments:
 
U.S. Concrete Pumping: Our U.S. concrete pumping services segment represented 73% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2021 and services from this segment are primarily provided under our Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands, which as of October 31, 2021 operated a total fleet of approximately 780 equipment units from a diversified footprint of approximately 90 locations across 19 states. We provide operated concrete pumping services, for which customers are billed on a negotiated time and volume basis based on the duration of the job and yards of concrete pumped. Additional charges (such as a fuel surcharge and travel costs) are frequently added based on specific project requirements. Typically, we send a single operator with each concrete pump. We do not take ownership of the concrete and thus have minimal inventory or product liability risk. We typically do not engage in fixed-bid work or have surety bonding requirements and operate a daily fee-based revenue model regardless of overall construction project completion.
U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services: Our U.S. concrete waste management services segment represented 12% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2021. Through our Eco-Pan business, we are a leading provider of concrete waste management services in the U.S. Eco-Pan provides a full-service, cost-effective, regulation-compliant solution to manage environmental issues caused by concrete washout. Eco-Pan is a route-based solution that operates approximately 90 trucks and over 6,900 custom metal pans or containers for construction sites from 17 locations in the U.S. as of October 31, 2021. We charge a round-trip delivery fee and a daily usage fee for the pans and containers, that is typically negotiated on a weekly or monthly rental rate. This provides a turnkey solution to the customer compared to the alternatives of bagging the waste concrete, pouring it into an on-site lined pit, or disposing of it into trash dumpsters and arranging for a pick-up. Eco-Pan delivers watertight pans to job sites to collect concrete washwater, and subsequently delivers it to recycling centers. Disposal fees charged by the recycling centers are passed on to the customer. To the extent that the pans are held at the job site for an extended number of days or irregular waste is found in the pan, we charge incremental fees. Our trucks are designed to allow for the pick-up and re-delivery of multiple pans, leading to significant incremental efficiencies as route densities increase.
 
U.K. Operations: Our U.K. operations represented 15% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2021 and consisted of concrete pumping and concrete waste management services. Our concrete pumping services are primarily provided through either our Camfaud brand (operated pumping services) or our Premier Concrete Pumping brand (rental of pumping equipment on a long-term basis without an operator). Mobile equipment is charged to customers under a minimum hire rate, which is typically five to eight hours. Our concrete pumping business in the U.K. is comprised of a fleet of approximately 380 equipment units that are serviced from 30 locations as of October 31, 2021. In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we started concrete waste management operations under our Eco-Pan brand name in the U.K. and the results of these operations are included in this segment. Our Eco-Pan business in the U.K. is operated from a shared Camfaud location as of October 31, 2021. We bill our customers for our Eco-Pan services in the same manner as our U.S. Eco-Pan services.
 
Corporate: Our Corporate segment is primarily related to the intercompany leasing of real estate to certain of our U.S Concrete Pumping branches.
 
Competitive Environment 
 
The concrete pumping industry is highly fragmented in both the U.S. and the U.K. In the U.S., we believe there are approximately 1,000 industry participants, the majority of which operate with an average of five to ten pumps each, a limited number having a multi-regional presence (average of 50-60 pumps) and no other company having a national presence. We believe many industry participants are undercapitalized, utilize aged equipment and operate only smaller and significantly fewer boom pumps. In a typical geographic market, we generally compete with only one or two other concrete pumping companies that can perform the larger and more complex projects that we typically target.
 
In the concrete waste management industry, we compete with local operators who may have a small number of washout pans but are not capable of offering services across the U.S. We believe we are the only operator of scale with a national footprint in this industry and estimate that there is only one competitor on a national level. While the technology underlying the washout pans is less sophisticated than that for a concrete pump, we believe having the route density that Eco-Pan has achieved is a differentiator in terms of profitability. Our U.K. operations is the pioneer of the concrete waste management service in the U.K. and as such, we are not aware of any equivalent competitor in the U.K.

Equipment
 
Our fleet is operated by approximately 830 experienced employees as of October 31, 2021, each of whom is required to complete rigorous training and safety programs. In addition, we have approximately 110 skilled mechanics who perform in-house equipment servicing. As of October 31, 2021, we owned 100% of our fleet consisting of approximately 820 boom pumps, ranging in size from 17 to 65 meters, 70 placing booms, 20 telebelts, 250 stationary pumps, and 90 waste management trucks. As of October 31, 2021, the average age of our fleet was approximately 9 years old and most of our equipment had useful lives of 20 to 25 years.
Customers
 
We serve a base of more than 14,000 customers (often with several projects per customer) across the U.S. and the U.K. and have an approximate 93% customer retention rate based on our top 500 customers and 100% customer retention rate of our top 100 customers as of October 31, 2021. In addition, as of October 31, 2021, our top ten customers represented less than 10% of our total revenue and had an average tenure of more than 20 years. Our customer composition is largely dependent on geographic location and general economic and construction market trends within individual operating markets. We actively monitor regional trends and target customers in fast-growing markets through our extensive geographic footprint and knowledge of the local construction markets in each region in which we operate.
 
Our customer base consists of general contractors or concrete contractors that span across the commercial, infrastructure and residential end markets. We also sell replacement parts to regional operators that lack the capital and scale to independently maintain a sufficiently stocked replacement parts inventory. Our contractual arrangements with customers are typically on a project-to-project purchase order basis.
 
Suppliers
 
We primarily purchase pumping equipment, replacement parts, and fuel for our day-to-day operations. Concrete pumping equipment is primarily sourced from three suppliers – Schwing, Putzmeister, and Alliance. There are a number of other suppliers as well and we are not solely dependent upon any single one. We believe we are the concrete pumping industry’s largest consumer of concrete pumping supplies and, as such, have significant leverage with respect to making purchases. We typically purchase fuel in bulk at favorable prices and utilize onsite fuel storage facilities.
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,300 employees across the U.S. and the U.K., of which approximately 940 are highly-skilled equipment operators and mechanics, approximately 100 are managers, approximately 50 are in sales, and approximately 60 are dispatchers. The remaining employees include administrative support, corporate functions, and laborers. Our employees have an average tenure of over five years for pump operators. Additionally, our regional managers have, on average, approximately 30 years of experience in the concrete pumping industry. We maintain a highly sophisticated, industry recognized training program, which ensures all operators can meet the requirements of any project. Operators are trained in concrete pumping as well as in basic mechanical repair, while shop managers are trained in inspection and maintenance of all critical truck systems.
 
Approximately 120 employees in CPH’s workforce are unionized across California, Oregon and Washington. These individuals are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers (“IUOE”) under three separate collective bargaining agreements. We have historically maintained favorable relations with the IUOE and have not experienced any significant disputes, disagreements, strikes or work stoppages.
 
Safety
 
To our knowledge, we are the only concrete pumping company in the U.S. and the U.K. with a comprehensive, active safety program, including an in-house corporate safety department and a designated safety trainer at each branch. As part of our safety management program, we actively track key safety performance indicators at each branch location to monitor safety performance and take corrective action when needed. Over the last two years, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) has remained better than industry averages.
