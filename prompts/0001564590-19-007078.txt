Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers using our proprietary small molecule nucleotide platform. We design our compounds to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states.  We are developing our lead product candidate, inarigivir soproxil, or inarigivir, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We have designed our antiviral product candidates, including inarigivir, to selectively activate within infected hepatic cells the cellular protein, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense.  We believe that inarigivir, as a RIG-I agonist, could play an important role in antiviral therapy as a result of its dual mechanism of action that is designed to selectively modulate the body’s immune response and inhibit viral replication.  We are also developing additional product candidates, including our lead STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) agonist product candidate, SB 11285, which is an immunotherapeutic agent for the potential treatment of selected cancers.
 The following table summarizes the status of our development pipeline. We retain exclusive global commercial rights to all of our compounds. 

Chronic HBV Program
 Chronic HBV infection, which is defined by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, for greater than six months, is a virus most commonly transmitted by contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person. Individuals with chronic HBV are at an increased risk of developing liver cancer, significant liver disease, or permanent scarring of the liver, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. There is no approved cure for chronic HBV. Currently approved, standard of care therapies for the treatment of chronic HBV lack a broadly sustained response following the discontinuation of treatment and have significant limitations. Although treatment with pegylated interferon-a, or PEG-IFN- α, products can ultimately reduce the amount of HBV DNA, or viral load, in the body, this treatment only has a limited effect on the rate of loss or clearance of HBsAg. PEG-IFN- α products also have significant side effects, including flu-like symptoms and fever and, with long term use, can lead to suppression of the production of red and white blood cells, mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects. Additionally, while nucleoside/tide analogue direct-acting oral antiviral agents such as entecavir (marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb as Baraclude®), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg (TDF) (marketed by Gilead as Viread®), and tenofovir alafenamide 25mg (TAF) (marketed by Gilead as Vemlidy®), which we collectively refer to as “NUCs,” have demonstrated that they potently suppress HBV DNA, which 
 2

generally we refer to as “viral suppression” or “virally-suppressed,” they generally only suppress the virus during treatment without providing significant levels of HBsAg loss or clearance.  Additionally, patients taking these NUCs likely require life-long treatment. 
 Experts and regulators have suggested that a “functional cure,” characterized as either the loss of HBsAg or complete suppression of HBV DNA production, both of which are sustained off therapy, should be the goal of any new curative HBV therapy. A functional cure for chronic HBV with a shorter, finite period of treatment could improve clinical prognosis with a reduction in the risks of cirrhosis and liver cancer.  
 Inarigivir Clinical Trial Strategy.  We are developing our lead product candidate, inarigivir, an orally-administered hepatic-selective immunomodulator, as a potential backbone in a combinatorial treatment for chronic HBV with the goal to accelerate and substantially increase chronic HBV functional cure rates in a simple, safe and selective manner.  
 ACHIEVE Trial.  We are currently evaluating inarigivir for the treatment of chronic HBV in a global Phase 2 multi-center clinical trial of inarigivir, which we refer to as the ACHIEVE trial.  The ACHIEVE trial is being conducted under our first clinical trial supply and collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead.  Approximately 80 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV have received doses of 25mg, 50mg, 100mg or 200mg of inarigivir or a placebo as a monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks, followed by all patients receiving a sequential dose of Viread for 12 weeks. The active-placebo randomization schedule was 4:1 in the inarigivir monotherapy dosing period. 
 In the first three cohorts (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) of the ACHIEVE trial, 13 of 47 patients (28%) had a 0.5 log10 or greater reduction in HBsAg.  Of these 13 responder patients, six were HBeAg-negative (-) patients and seven were HBeAg-positive (+) patients.  Additionally, we have observed a dose dependent response of inarigivir on HBV DNA and HBV RNA over the first three cohorts.  To date, inarigivir has been well tolerated in the ACHIEVE trial, with no inarigivir-related serious adverse events observed, and no flu-like symptoms or other interferon-like side effects.
 All patients in the final 200mg cohort of the ACHIEVE trial have completed dosing of Viread and top-line results from the final 200mg cohort will be presented at The International Liver Congress, the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in April 2019.
 Gilead Collaboration.  In July 2017, we entered into our second clinical trial collaboration agreement with Gilead under which Gilead is funding and conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial examining the co-administration of inarigivir and Vemlidy in patients infected with chronic HBV.  This clinical trial collaboration was expanded in August 2018 to include two additional cohorts. In the first cohort of this Phase 2 trial, treatment-naive patients received 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 50mg and Vemlidy, while in the second cohort treatment-naive patients are receiving 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 200mg and Vemlidy. In a third cohort, Gilead is evaluating the administration of inarigivir 100mg in virally-suppressed patients who are already are and continue to be treated with a NUC.  While we have approved the protocol for this trial under a joint steering committee, Gilead is conducting this trial at their own expense.
 CATALYST Trials.  We plan to initiate in the first half of 2019 two major Phase 2 global trials examining the administration of inarigivir 400mg in different patient populations and under different dosing regimens.  We anticipate that the first global trial will be conducted in Asia and the U.S. and will evaluate non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve HBeAg positive and negative patients infected with chronic HBV who receive inarigivir 400mg as both(i) monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks, and (ii) in combination with Vemlidy for 24 weeks.  We refer to this trial as the CATALYST 1 trial.  Pre-defined responder patients at week 24 will continue to receive inarigivir 400mg and Vemlidy for up to an additional 24 weeks to determine if they are able to achieve a functional cure.
 Concurrent with the CATALYST 1 trial, we plan to initiate a separate trial, which we refer to as the CATALYST 2 trial, in the United Kingdom and Canada examining the use of inarigivir 400mg in non-cirrhotic, virally-suppressed patients currently on a NUC (i) following the cessation of treatment with a NUC, which we refer to as “Stop and Shock” treatment, and (ii) with the continued dosing of a NUC, which we refer to as “Suppress and Shock” treatment.  Under the “Stop and Shock” treatment, patients will receive inarigivir 400mg for 24 weeks and then stop all treatment to evaluate for loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression over time, up to 18 months.  Under the “Suppress and Shock” treatment, patients will receive inarigivir 400mg, in addition to their current NUC treatment, for a period of 24-48 weeks, and again stop all treatment with a follow up to see if there is either loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression off treatment. Pending preliminary results from the CATALYST studies, we plan to conduct a separate “Suppress and Shock” trial in the United States and the European Union, potentially in the second half of 2019.  This trial could evaluate the efficacy of inarigivir 400mg over the course of 48 weeks in virally-suppressed patients when compared to the use of a NUC alone.
 The CATALYST trial designs allow for evaluation of the likelihood of functional cure and have the potential ability to define the design of Phase 3 trials to allow for a regulatory strategy for the co-administration of inarigivir with a NUC and inarigivir 
 3

monotherapy in selected chronic HBV patient populations. The ability to continue treatment for up to 48 weeks and the stopping of treatment with follow up to look for sustained response will define whether inarigivir, when combined with a NUC alone or as a finite monotherapy in “Stop and Shock,” is adequate in either treatment-naïve or virally-suppressed patient populations.
 We anticipate reporting interim top-line results from the CATALYST trials throughout 2020 and into 2021.
 Fixed-Dose Combination (SB 9225).  We are also pursuing the development of SB 9225, a co-formulation of inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, as a potential fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV.   We have conducted early development work that indicates compatibility of inarigivir with Viread in the same formulation.  We have conducted additional formulation development work for SB 9225 and successfully manufactured initial quantities of SB 9225.  The introduction of SB 9225, if approved, could potentially result in enhanced patient compliance and allow for a more favorable safety profile.  Subject to the results of our Phase 2 inarigivir trials, we could be in a position to initiate a Phase 3 program for SB 9225 in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2020.
 Inarigivir Strategic Collaborations.  The treatment of chronic HBV is complex and heterogenous, and we believe that any curative treatment will require a combinatorial approach.  Although our initial approach has been to evaluate inarigivir in combination with NUCs (see “Gilead Collaboration” above), we have explored pre-clinical studies of inarigivir with novel drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than a NUC. Accordingly, we intend to enter into additional collaborations to develop inarigivir with products or product candidates that have different pharmacological mechanisms of action than inarigivir or a NUC.  Specifically, we are considering novel combination opportunities for inarigivir, including combination with siRNA compounds, core protein allosteric modifiers (CpAMs) and toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors.  We anticipate that inarigivir, together with a NUC, will be included in at least one “triple combination” clinical trial with a siRNA compound or a different mechanism in 2019.
 Immuno-Oncology Program
 We have identified multiple STING agonist compounds as potential immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of selected cancers. Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote a strong anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses. We believe that the distinctive chemistry that we use to develop our STING agonists allows for conjugation with other therapeutic modalities, including but not limited to nanoparticle formulation and antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, for targeted delivery and potential for improved tolerability, safety and efficacy.
 We are developing our lead STING agonist product candidate, SB 11285, as a second-generation immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers. In our preclinical studies in multiple tumor-derived cell lines, SB 11285 has been observed to cause the induction of cytokines consistent with engagement of the STING target, as well as cell death and apoptosis.  Based on our preclinical studies performed to date, SB 11285 has reduced tumor volumes in multiple rodent tumor models when administered intravenously or intratumorally.  These findings lead us to believe that SB 11285 has the potential to be administered clinically by either route of administration, and that SB 11285 may be used to target a variety of tumors at various anatomic sites and, if approved, has the potential to be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities to enhance efficacy.  
 We are currently advancing the SB 11285 program with preclinical, toxicology, and process development efforts. Subject to the results of these preclinical studies, we anticipate that we will submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, for SB 11285 in the second quarter of 2019, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in cancer later in 2019. SB 11285 could be the first intravenously-administered STING agonist product candidate to enter clinical development.
 Intellectual Property Estate
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a global intellectual property portfolio consisting of 70 issued patents worldwide and hold multiple patent applications directed to our lead product candidate, together with trade secrets and know-how. As of December 31, 2018, we held one U.S. patent, one European patent and multiple other foreign patents with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir that begin to expire in December 2026 and a second U.S. patent with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir that expires in June 2030, in each case, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions. We hold U.S. and international patent applications with claims covering the composition of matter of SB 11285. If any of these SB 11285 patent applications are issued, the patents would begin to expire in 2037, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions.

Our Technology 
 Nucleotides and nucleic acids bind to the active sites of proteins as part of normal cellular processes in order to regulate biological functions. Proteins can bind either directly to nucleic acids or indirectly through an alternative nucleic acid-protein complex. Modulating these interactions through agonism (producing or encouraging binding) and antagonism (limiting or discouraging binding) affords potentially broad therapeutic potential and provides an opportunity to target proteins and their biological functions that are typically considered challenging with current modalities. 
 We design our compounds to modulate the interaction between nucleotides or nucleic acids and proteins. Because our compounds resemble naturally occurring nucleotides and nucleic acids in the body, we believe they can be more efficient in modulating the interactions with proteins through higher selectivity than traditional small molecule approaches. 
 We have focused our research on the optimization of our novel compounds with favorable drug attributes using various approaches including rational drug design, combinatorial chemistry, structural biology and phenotypic screening approaches. By making specific structural modifications to our compounds, we enable them to bind to targets in the diseased tissues with high affinity and selectivity. 
 Unlike other nucleic acid-based approaches that act by inhibiting specific protein expression through downregulation of messenger RNA, such as RNA interference, compounds act directly on proteins and therefore can be used to either upregulate or downregulate the activities of the proteins that play a role in disease processes. We have designed inarigivir to bind selectively to and activate RIG-I, a protein that is involved in the activation of the body’s immune response to foreign pathogens. 
 Some distinguishing features of compounds within our platform include: 
  
• | Novel mechanisms of action. Inarigivir and our other novel compounds are designed to inhibit viral replication through two mechanisms:(i) a direct acting anti-viral (DAA) mechanism where inarigivir acts a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to inhibit the interaction of pre-genomic RNA, or pgRNA, and HBV DNA polymerase within the replication complex; and (ii) binding to RIG-I with activation within the hepatocyte of the innate immune response through production of natural immunomodulatory cytokines, including type I and II interferons. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to block the protective effects of interferon production. Our compounds are designed to restore interferon production in infected cells. In the case of chronic HBV, we believe that induction of the innate immune response is required for loss or clearance of HBsAg and the achievement of a functional cure.

• | Multiple routes of delivery, including oral administration. Because our novel compounds have small molecule characteristics, they can be delivered orally. Additionally, our compounds potentially may be delivered intravenously and through intra-nasal and inhalation delivery, depending on the target disease. We believe that the versatility of our compounds may allow us to design compounds that use the optimal delivery approach for the target disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to treat a broad range of viral, inflammatory and oncological diseases. We design our compounds to selectively target certain proteins whose presence or activity contributes to disease severity or causes the underlying disease. We believe that this approach is potentially applicable to a broad range of viral, inflammatory and oncological diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selective immune response. Certain of our compounds are designed to trigger a specific immune response in virally infected cells. To date, we have not observed a nonspecific, extra-hepatic immune response in our completed preclinical and clinical trials of inarigivir. Our STING agonists are designed to activate immune cells for efficient immune-mediated anti-tumor response. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for use in combination with other antiviral agents. Because our compounds are designed to act by an immunomodulatory function, we believe they may be developed for use in combination with other antiviral agents that act against viral disease by different mechanisms of action.

Our HBV Program
 We have two compounds in development for the treatment of chronic HBV, including our lead product candidate inarigivir. We have designed our HBV product candidates to selectively activate within infected hepatic cells the cellular protein, RIG-I, to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense.

Interferon is an immunomodulatory cytokine with potent antiviral activity. Interferon activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in infected cells. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against virus infection before the adaptive immune response is induced. It is well established that the innate immune response is critical to restricting virus replication and infection. The adaptive immune system is part of the overall immune system and is required to eliminate or prevent pathogen growth. Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.
RIG-I is inactive in uninfected cells but is activated when a cell is virally infected. The activation of RIG-I results in the production of interferon within the cells through a well-regulated signaling pathway. Viruses invade cells and are able to replicate and spread because they have mechanisms to block the protective effects of antiviral signaling proteins, such as RIG-I. Viral genomes encode proteins that can block interferon synthesis and signaling, inhibit the function of interferon-induced antiviral proteins and produce interferon receptor decoy molecules to prevent induction of interferon signaling. Thus, by turning off interferon production and function, viruses abrogate the immune response, which enables them to multiply rapidly in cells. 
 
Inarigivir is designed to inhibit viral replication through two mechanisms:(i) a direct acting anti-viral (DAA) mechanism where inarigivir acts a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to inhibit the interaction of pgRNA and HBV DNA polymerase within the replication complex; and (ii) binding to RIG-I with activation within the hepatocyte of the innate immune response through production of natural immunomodulatory cytokines, including type 1 and II interferons.  Given these novel host-targeted mechanisms of action of inarigivir and its potential ability to cause the loss or clearance of HBsAg, we plan to develop inarigivir primarily in combination with currently marketed and investigational direct-acting oral antiviral agents or other treatments with differing mechanisms of action.
 We have not yet submitted an IND application to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and may not conduct any clinical trial for inarigivir in the United States until we submit an IND to the FDA. We intend to submit an IND to the FDA for inarigivir in 2019.
 Current Standard of Care for Chronic HBV Lacks a Sustained Response
 There is no approved cure for chronic HBV. The current standard of care treatments for chronic HBV include PEG-IFN-a products and direct-acting oral antiviral agents, which we refer to as NUCs. 
 A PEG-IFN-a product is an antiviral medication administered by injection in which the chemical substance known as polyethylene glycol, or PEG, is chemically attached to interferon-a to improve the duration of effect of interferon-a. Interferon-a is a protein that interferes with viral replication within host cells. In Europe, PEG-IFN-a products are indicated for first line treatment of chronic HBV virus according to guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver for chronic HBV treatment for certain patient populations. However, PEG-IFN-a products have significant limitations. Although treatment with PEG-IFN-a products can reduce the amount of HBV DNA in the body, the treatment only has a minor effect on the rate of HBsAg reduction or loss. PEG-IFN-a products also have significant side effects, including flu-like symptoms and fever and, with long term use, can lead to suppression of the production of red and white blood cells, mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects. 
 Direct-acting oral antiviral agents for chronic HBV, such as Baraclude, Viread and Vemlidy, have demonstrated they suppress viral replication. These direct-acting oral antiviral agents are potent suppressors of HBV DNA, but generally only suppress the virus during treatment without providing significant loss or clearance of HBsAg, and patients taking these antiviral agents require potentially life-long treatment. 
 Experts and regulators have suggested that a “functional cure,” characterized by sustained loss of HBsAg with or without hepatitis B surface antibody conversion, should be the goal of any new curative HBV therapy.  Studies have indicated that the current functional cure rate, when combining PEG-IFN-a and Viread over a 48-week treatment period, is less than 10%.  According to an article published in the Journal of Hepatology in August 2017, experts believe that for any future treatment to significantly increase the current functional cure rate, an immunomodulatory agent will likely be a necessary component of therapy.  
 There is a significant unmet need for a chronic HBV treatment that can be administered orally with a favorable safety profile. We believe that the immunomodulatory activity of inarigivir could become a key component of a future combinatorial treatment for patients infected with chronic HBV, potentially increasing the percentage of chronic HBV patients who achieve a functional cure.  Specifically, a functional cure with a shorter, finite period of treatment could improve clinical prognosis with a reduction in the risks of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Early Decline in HBsAg at Week 12 Represents a Key Predictor of Response and Eventual Loss of HBsAg for Interferon and Perhaps Other Immunomodulators in HBV. Reduction in HBsAg following 12 weeks of treatment, either with monotherapy PEG-IFN-a or the combination of PEG-IFN-a with a direct-acting oral antiviral agent, has been reported by researchers as a predictive biomarker of response and eventual loss of HBsAg in patients with chronic HBV. 
 In a report published in Hepatology in 2013, researchers presented the results of a pooled analysis of over 800 participants from three global HBV trials in which HBsAg decline following 12 weeks of treatment with either monotherapy PEG-IFN-a or the combination of PEG-IFN-a with the oral antiviral Epivir-HBV (lamivudine) was predictive of six-month post-treatment response rates in patients with chronic HBV (26% response rate with HBsAg decline at 12 weeks compared to 14% response rate with no HBsAg decline at 12 weeks). In this analysis, treatment response was defined as a composite endpoint of HBeAg loss with an HBV DNA level <2,000 IU/mL or HBsAg loss at 24 weeks after the end of treatment. 
 Separately, in November 2014, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)—The Liver Meeting, Gilead presented data from a randomized trial evaluating various treatment cohorts, including monotherapy with PEG-IFN-a, monotherapy with Viread, and the combination of PEG-IFN-a and Viread, in 740 patients with chronic HBV. Overall, HBsAg loss was only observed in patients receiving PEG-IFN-a either alone or in combination with Viread.  The combination arm of PEG-IFN-a and Viread demonstrated that only 7.3% of patients had HBsAg loss at Week 48 of treatment, which was predicted by a greater than 0.5log10 reduction in HBsAg at Week 12 of treatment.  A 1.0 log10 reduction means a 90% lower virus level in the treated patient from baseline.
 Based on the reported findings and inarigivir’s observed ability to induce intracellular interferon signaling pathways, we believe that our assessments of HBsAg decline at Week 12 in our ACHIEVE clinical trial and the clinical trial that Gilead is conducting may be indicative of inarigivir’s ability to cause the loss or clearance of HBsAg in treated patients following a longer duration of treatment.
 Novel biomarkers that measure the initial production of pgRNA from covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA, such as serum HBV RNA, are emerging as important early serum predictors of inhibition of viral replication and may help guide combination strategies for clinical trial development and regulatory pathways.  Multiple companies developing drug candidates, including siRNAs targeting HBV and HBV-specific capsid inhibitors, are exploring the utility of this novel biomarker.  HBV RNA is a secondary endpoint in our ACHIEVE trial to enable us to evaluate its utility as a predictor for HBsAg loss.  
 Clinical Development of Inarigivir
 Inarigivir is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic HBV in multiple worldwide clinical trials.  Based on the preclinical and clinical data we have generated to date, as well as the safety demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trial of inarigivir in patients with hepatitis C virus, or HCV, we believe inarigivir may induce an antiviral immune response during chronic HBV infection and cause loss or clearance of HBsAg without the side effects associated with PEG-IFN-a products. We believe that by reducing HBsAg, inarigivir has the potential to provide a functional cure for chronic HBV patients when used in combination with other antiviral agents, thus leading to a finite and shorter duration of treatment.
 ACHIEVE Trial.  In 2016, we initiated the ACHIEVE trial in patients with chronic HBV to explore the use of inarigivir as a monotherapy for 12 weeks, followed by treatment with Viread for 12 weeks, in a clinical trial collaboration with Gilead. We conducted the ACHIEVE multi-center clinical trial of inarigivir in Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan to enable us to select appropriate dose level(s) to move forward into additional clinical trials and to provide us with the necessary safety and efficacy data to study the combined use of inarigivir and Viread.  The ACHIEVE trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial in up to 100 non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV using doses of 25mg, 50mg, 100mg and 200mg of inarigivir as a monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks. Following this treatment, all patients will receive treatment with Viread as a monotherapy for 12 weeks. Patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between an inarigivir dose group or placebo on a 4:1 basis. Patients will be stratified based on HBeAg (+/-) status. HBeAg is a non-structural protein which is secreted by the virus and whose presence in blood, or HBeAg(+), is indicative of wild type or non-mutated virus with high levels of viral replication. The loss of HBeAg occurs secondary to mutations in the virus and results in a patient becoming HBeAg(-) with a resulting lower level of actively replicating virus. The primary endpoints of the ACHIEVE trial are safety and antiviral activity, as measured by the change in HBV DNA at week 12 from baseline. Multiple exploratory secondary endpoints include reduction or loss of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV RNA.
 In the first three cohorts (25mg, 50mg and 100mg) of the ACHIEVE trial, 13 of 47 patients (28%) had a 0.5 log10 or greater reduction in HBsAg.  Of these 13 responder patients, six were HBeAg-negative (-) patients and seven were HBeAg-positive (+) patients.  Additionally, we observed a dose dependent response of inarigivir on HBV DNA and HBV RNA, and of the 16 HBeAg-negative patients who had detectable HBV RNA at baseline, nine had undetectable HBV RNA at the end of the 12-week monotherapy dosing regimen.  Blood levels of HBsAg and HBV RNA are generally viewed as biomarkers for the presence of active cccDNA, 
 7

which is the major reservoir for chronic HBV and the template for viral replication.  Accordingly, reductions in HBsAg and HBV RNA have been associated with clearance of ccc DNA.  Inarigivir responses have been proportional to the baseline HBsAg level and we believe are reflective of the mechanism of action of inarigivir as an immunomodulator. Baseline HBsAg level < 10,000 IU (4log10) remains the strongest predictor of response to inarigivir across all cohorts for HBV DNA and HBV RNA reductions irrespective of HBeAg status.  This response is consistent with the known role of HBsAg as a down regulator of the host immune response to HBV. To date, inarigivir has been well tolerated in the ACHIEVE trial, with no inarigivir-related serious adverse events observed. Treatment-emergent adverse events have ranged from mild to moderate in severity, with no flu-like symptoms or other interferon-like side effects.  One clinical serious adverse event of knee pain likely unrelated to inarigivir and one biochemical event of a transient, non-sustained Grade 3 hypertryglyceridemia were observed.  
 All patients in the final 200mg cohort of the ACHIEVE trial have completed dosing of Viread and top-line results from the final 200mg cohort will be presented at The International Liver Congress, the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in April 2019.
 Gilead Clinical Trial Supply and Collaboration Agreement.  In July 2017, we entered into our second collaboration agreement with Gilead, which was amended in August 2018 to expand the collaboration.  Under this clinical trial supply and collaboration agreement, Gilead is funding and conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial examining (i) the co-administration of inarigivir and Vemlidy and (ii) the evaluation of inarigivir in chronic HBV patients whose viral load is suppressed.  In the first cohort, 30 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV received 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 50mg and Vemlidy. In the second cohort, up to 30 treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HBV are receiving 12 weeks of combination therapy with inarigivir 200mg and Vemlidy.  All patients in the first two cohorts will also receive Vemlidy as a monotherapy for 36 weeks. In a third cohort, Gilead is evaluating the administration of inarigivir 100mg in chronic HBV patients whose viral load is suppressed and who are already being treated with a NUC.
 CATALYST 1 and CATALYST 2 Trials.  We plan to initiate in the first half of 2019 two major Phase 2 global trials examining the administration of inarigivir 400mg in different patient populations and under different dosing regimens.  
 We anticipate that the first global trial, the CATALYST 1 trial, will be conducted in Asia and the U.S. and will evaluate in up to 60 treatment-naïve HBeAg positive and negative patients.  Under this response-guided trial, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following three arms: (i) 20 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg monotherapy daily for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks; (ii) 20 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg monotherapy three times per week for 12 weeks followed by the sequential treatment of Vemlidy for 12 weeks; and (iii) 30 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg in combination with Vemlidy for 24 weeks.  Pre-defined responder patients at week 24 will continue to receive inarigivir 400mg and Vemlidy for up to an additional 24 weeks to determine if they are able to achieve a functional cure.
 Concurrent with the CATALYST 1 trial, we plan to initiate the CATALYST 2 trial in the United Kingdom and Canada examining the use of inarigivir 400mg.  We anticipate that this trial will evaluate up to 60 virally-suppressed patients currently on a NUC (i) following the cessation of treatment with a NUC, which we refer to as “Stop and Shock” treatment, and (ii) with the continued dosing of a NUC, which we refer to as “Suppress and Shock” treatment.  Under the “Stop and Shock” treatment, 20 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg for 24 weeks and then stop all treatment to evaluate for loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression over time, up to 18 months.  Under the response-guided “Suppress and Shock” treatment, 40 patients will receive inarigivir 400mg, in addition to their current NUC treatment, for a period of 24-48 weeks, and again stop all treatment with a follow up to see if there is either loss of HBsAg or sustained viral suppression off treatment. The CATALYST 2 trial will include specialized fine needle aspirations of the liver to evaluate intra-hepatic immune responses.
 Pending preliminary results from the CATALYST studies, we plan to conduct a separate “Suppress and Shock” trial in the United States and the European Union, potentially in the second half of 2019.  This trial could evaluate the efficacy of inarigivir 400mg over the course of 48 weeks in virally-suppressed patients when compared to the use of a NUC alone.
 The CATALYST trial designs allow for evaluation of the likelihood of functional cure and have the potential ability to define the design of Phase 3 trials to allow for a regulatory strategy for the co-administration of inarigivir with a NUC and inarigivir monotherapy in selected chronic HBV patient populations. The ability to continue treatment for up to 48 weeks and the stopping of treatment with follow up to look for sustained response will define whether inarigivir, when combined with a NUC alone or as a finite monotherapy in “Stop and Shock,” is adequate in either treatment-naïve or virally-suppressed patient populations.
 We anticipate reporting interim top-line results from the CATALYST trials throughout 2020 and into 2021.
 Liver Biopsy Study.  We plan to conduct a single center study in Singapore to evaluate the intra-hepatic activation of the immune response by inarigivir and to correlate immunology findings with the effect on HBV intra-hepatic virology, in particular cccDNA. In this study, eight virally-suppressed patients with chronic HBV will receive inarigivir 400mg daily to three times a week 
 8

and have liver biopsies before treatment and at week six on treatment. Liver biopsies will undergo specialized immunology and virology studies to correlate and confirm the intra-hepatic mechanism of action on both immune function and HBV replication. We anticipate reporting initial results from this study in late 2019.
 Other Development Efforts for Chronic HBV
 SB 9225 Fixed-Dose Combination.  We are also pursuing the development of SB 9225, a co-formulation of inarigivir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, as a potential fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV. We have conducted early development work that indicates compatibility of inarigivir with Viread in the same formulation. We have conducted additional formulation development work for SB 9225 and successfully manufactured initial quantities of SB 9225.  The introduction of SB 9225, if approved, could potentially result in enhanced patient compliance and allow for a more favorable safety profile. Subject to the results of our Phase 2 inarigivir trials, we could be in a position to initiate a Phase 3 program for SB 9225 in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2020.
 HBx Antisense Program.  Recent scientific literature has established the important role of the HBx gene in the life cycle of the Hepatitis B virus and in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and identified HBx as a promising target for the treatment of HBV. We are developing novel antisense oligonucleotide compounds to block HBx expression in HBV patients.  We are evaluating these compounds to assess their potential as product candidates.
 Other Strategic Initiatives for Chronic HBV
The treatment of chronic HBV is complex and heterogenous, and we believe that any curative treatment will require a combinatorial approach. Although our initial approach has been to evaluate inarigivir in combination with NUCs (see “Gilead Clinical Trial and Supply Collaboration Agreement” above), we have explored pre-clinical studies of inarigivir with novel drugs with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than a NUC.   Accordingly, we intend to enter into additional clinical collaborations with others to develop inarigivir with products or product candidates that have different pharmacological mechanisms of action than inarigivir or NUCs.  Specifically, we are considering novel combination opportunities for inarigivir, including combination with siRNA compounds and CpAMs and TLR8 or PD-1 inhibitors.  We anticipate that inarigivir, together with a NUC, will be included in at least one “triple combination” clinical trial with a siRNA compound or a different mechanism in 2019.
 Immuno-Oncology Program
 
In addition to our HBV clinical program, we are also developing multiple compounds for the potential treatment of selected cancers.
 
STING Agonist Program
 We have developed multiple STING agonist compounds, which are differentiated cyclic dinucleotides, as potential immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of selected cancers. Immunotherapy has emerged in recent years as a transformative approach for the treatment of cancer because the induction of interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in tumor cells and within the tumor microenvironment is essential for modulating the host-immune response and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote a strong anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses. 
SB 11285.  We are developing our lead STING agonist product candidate, SB 11285, as a second-generation immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers. In our preclinical studies in multiple tumor-derived cell lines, SB 11285 has been observed to cause the induction of cytokines consistent with engagement of the STING target, as well as cell death and apoptosis.  Based on our preclinical studies performed to date, SB 11285 has demonstrated efficacy in multiple syngeneic rodent tumor models when administered intravenously or intratumorally.  These findings lead us to believe that SB 11285 has the potential to be administered clinically by either route of administration and enables SB 11285 to target a variety of tumors at various anatomic sites.
 
We a
re currently advancing the SB 11285 program with preclinical, toxicology, and process development efforts. We anticipate that we will submit an IND for SB 11285 in the second quarter of 2019, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in cancer later in 2019.  SB 11285 could be the first intravenously-administered STING agonist product candidate to enter clinical development.
 
Combination of STING Agonists with New Therapeutic Modalities.  We believe the chemistry used to develop our STING agonists also allows for site-specific conjugation to other therapeutic modalities including antibodies to form antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. The formulation of our STING agonists in combination with an antibody to form an ADC could provide 
 9

targeted delivery to the tumor via a bio-reversible linker that is designed to release the STING agonist  at the tumor site. We are also developing a nanoparticle formulation for systemic delivery of our STING agonists. In in vitro studies involving the use of a nanoparticle formulation of SB 11285, we have observed potent STING agonist activity. Both of these approaches may distinguish the profile and widen the therapeutic index of SB 11285 by enabling its delivery  to the target cells to effect tumor clearance.
 
RIG-I Agonist Program
 
Spring Bank is building upon its expertise and experience in discovering and developing inarigivir, a RIG-I agonist, to discover and develop new novel RIG-I agonists specifically for potential oncology indications. 
Other Early Research &Development Programs
 STING Antagonist Program 
 In addition to our pipeline of antiviral and immune-oncology product candidates, we plan to explore the use of novel STING antagonist compounds for the treatment of certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our STING antagonists are designed to block aberrant STING-dependent signaling that contribute to inflammatory diseases.  We are optimizing  different structural classes to develop lead compounds for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success will depend upon our ability, and upon the ability of any future collaborators of ours, to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection in the United States and other key pharmaceutical markets around the world for our product candidates and technologies, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We have sought, and plan to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and other key pharmaceutical markets, that is intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 We have devoted considerable effort and resources to build a substantial patent estate designed to provide multiple levels of protection for our product candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we licensed two and owned more than 20 patent families. These patent families include nearly 200 patents and patent applications worldwide, including 12 patents and 38 patent applications in the United States and 58 patents and 90 patent applications outside the United States. Of these patents, four U.S. patents and five patents outside of the United States are subject to our license with BioHEP Technologies Ltd., or BioHEP. The licensed families include the active ingredient in inarigivir, i.e., SB 9000, and methods of assembling libraries of our compounds. Our patents and patent applications include protection for: 
  
• | compositions of matter for our compounds;
--+------------------------------------------


• | processes for synthesizing and manufacturing our compounds;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | methods of using our compounds to treat or prevent disorders such as microbial infections, including dosage forms and formulations and methods relating to course of treatment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | methods of assembling libraries of our compounds.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 With respect to inarigivir, as of December 31, 2018, we held one U.S. patent with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir specifically, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treating HBV and methods of preparing inarigivir. This patent is expected to expire in December 2026, without considering any potential patent term extensions. As of December 31, 2018, we also held one U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of inarigivir generically, methods of treating HBV, including combination therapy with other agents and treatment of resistant strains of HBV. With patent term adjustment, this patent is expected to expire in June 2030, without considering any potential patent term extensions. This patent has been granted in the European Patent Office and has been nationalized in all the major countries in Europe. These nationalized patents, when issued, are expected to begin to expire in December 2026. We hold patents that have been granted in China, Japan and Korea with claims covering the active ingredient in inarigivir, and methods of using this compound. These patents are expected to begin to expire in 2022. We also hold patent applications that cover methods of using inarigivir, including in viral infections such as HBV and HCV. These patent applications, if issued, will begin to expire in 2031. In addition, we hold patent applications with claims covering the composition of matter of inarigivir generically and specifically in China, Europe, Hong Kong and India, which, if issued, are expected to begin to expire in December 2026. 
 10

We hold U.S. and foreign patent applications, which include methods of using inarigivir in various diseases, including certain resistant strains of infections such as HBV and HCV. If these patent applications are issued, the patents would be expected to begin to expire in 2037, without considering any potential patent term extensions. 
 We hold U.S. provisional patent applications, international (PCT) patent applications, and foreign patent applications which include claims to compositions of matter and various methods of using our STING agonists, including SB 11285, in oncology. If any of these patent applications are issued, the patents would be expected to begin to expire in 2037, without considering any potential patent term adjustments or extensions.
 In each case, we own or hold the exclusive license to the foregoing patents and patent applications. We are not aware of any contested proceeding or third-party claims that cover any of our patents or patent applications. 
 The actual protection afforded by a particular patent varies from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country in which it issued. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering inarigivir may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved product candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 BioHEP License 
 In January 2016, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement, or the amended license agreement, with BioHEP which amended and restated our prior license agreement with BioHEP which we entered into in December 2003. The amended license agreement became effective on February 1, 2016. Under the amended license agreement, BioHEP granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and know-how to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain product candidates comprising a novel phosphorothioate dinucleotide and certain related compounds, which include inarigivir, SB 9400, SB 9941 and SB 9946, for the diagnosis and/or treatment of all viral diseases and conditions. 
 We are solely responsible, at our expense, for conducting all research, development and commercialization activities with respect to licensed products. 
 Under the terms of the original license agreement, we issued to BioHEP 12,500 shares of our common stock and 1,000,000 shares of our series A preferred stock, which shares of Series A preferred stock were converted into 250,000 shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering in May 2016. In connection with entering into the amended license agreement, we issued to BioHEP an additional 125,000 shares of our common stock and issued to BioHEP a warrant to purchase an additional 125,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, which warrant expired unexercised on August 1, 2018. Under the license agreement, BioHEP is eligible to receive up to $3.5 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for disease(s) caused by each distinct virus for which we develop licensed product(s). BioHEP is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low-to-mid single-digits on net product sales of licensed products by us and our affiliates and sublicensees, and a specified share of non-royalty sublicensing revenues we and our affiliates receive from sublicensees, which share of sublicensing revenues is capped at a maximum aggregate of $2.0 million under all such sublicenses. 
 BioHEP’s royalty rights generally extend on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire of the BioHEP patent rights licensed to us or of patent rights claiming specified improvements that we own that cover the licensed product in the applicable country. 
 Our agreement with BioHEP will remain in effect until the expiration of all royalty obligations under the agreement with respect to all licensed products in all countries. We may terminate the agreement for our convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice to BioHEP. BioHEP may terminate this agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize products in accordance with the development plan for the 
 11

licensed product. The agreement may also be terminated in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified notice period or in the case of specified bankruptcy events involving the other party. 
 If the agreement is terminated with respect to any one or more country, all licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate only with respect to any such countries and specified rights in such countries will revert to BioHEP. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our compounds or their components. To date, we have only manufactured supplies of drug substance for use in our preclinical studies at our own facilities and have contracted with several third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and finished product to meet our needs for preclinical testing, including toxicology studies and clinical trials. We believe that each of these suppliers has sufficient capacity to meet our needs, and that adequate alternative sources exist. We typically order drug substance and clinical trial supplies on a work order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we explore additional sources of supply and believe that we will have additional manufacturer(s) in place in the future for the manufacture of clinical drug supply and the commercial manufacture of inarigivir. If the supply of drug substance is insufficient to complete our trials or we are unable to obtain alternative sources of supply on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all, our business may be adversely affected. We expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of drug substance and clinical trial supplies for our compounds for the foreseeable future. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements that govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. We are reliant on our contract manufacturers to comply with these requirements, including manufacturing our compounds for use in clinical trials under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals intended for use in humans. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any collaboration or co-promotion arrangements. We may build focused capabilities in the United States to commercialize development programs where we believe that the medical specialists for the indications are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to promote the product effectively with a targeted sales team. We could engage in strategic relationships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the development of our programs and/or realize greater value for our shareholders due to faster access to broader geographic markets or the pursuit of broader patient populations or indications. 
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. 
 FDA-approved treatments for patients with chronic HBV include PEG-IFN-a products, including Pegasys® (PEG-IFN a-2a), marketed by Genentech, Inc., and PEG-Intron® (PEG-IFN a-2b), marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., and oral antiviral agents such as the nucleoside analog Baraclude, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and the nucleotide analogs Viread and Vemlidy, marketed by Gilead. In addition, several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus, Arrowhead, Assembly Biosciences, Inc., Gilead and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., are developing therapies with varying mechanisms of action to address chronic HBV, including non-nucleotide antivirals and non-interferon immune enhancers. We believe that instead of competing with certain of these therapies, inarigivir has the potential to be used as a complementary therapy to certain of the treatments identified above. 
 There are also FDA-approved vaccinations available for children and high-risk adults that protect against HBV. These vaccines are manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., Dynavax and GlaxoSmithKline Plc and are widely available in the United States (and less available in certain parts of the world) and have limited side effects. Although the vaccines are effective against HBV in non-infected individuals, they do not reverse or cure the disease in people who have already contracted the virus. 
 Our STING agonist program will face significant competition from companies in the immuno-oncology subsector of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.  We are aware that multiple large and small pharmaceutical companies, including Merck 
 12

& Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Novartis AG, as well as other companies such as Aduro Biotech, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. 
 We compete with the biotechnology companies listed above and others in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales and marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of inarigivir, SB 9225, SB 11285 and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of lower cost products. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
• | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any point in development, and depending upon the scope of the hold, clinical trial(s) may not restart until resolution of the outstanding concerns to the FDA’s satisfaction. 
 In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate statistically the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
• | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA, the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Review of an NDA by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees typically increase annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “Priority Review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The FDA may extend the review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 15

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and using of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if the product is intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review Designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if the product is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the FDA may withdraw the Fast Track Designation if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “Breakthrough Therapies.” A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A Priority Review Designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 16

Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 Based on the FDA’s evaluation of an NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of an NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 17

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug…” 
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 18

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment of data. FDASIA sets forth the specific timing of the submission of the pediatric study plan. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until the FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent if valid and infringed by the proposed product. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than 
 19

what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in Europe and other Foreign Jurisdictions 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Commission and EU Member State Competent Authorities. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, an applicant must obtain the approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than 28 May 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. 
 20

There are two types of MAs: 
  
• | Community MAs, which are issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210-day review period is reduced to 150 days.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 Regulatory Data Exclusivity in the European Union 
 In the European Union, innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 21

Periods of Authorization and Renewals in the EU 
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years based on a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 
 Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 
 Similar to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. 
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on central marketing authorization holders for medicinal products the obligation to conduct a labor-intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies. 
 The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. 
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals. 
 22

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU 
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. In addition, the period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated based on available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if our product candidate is approved, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidate could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidate will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the United States federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since enactment of the PPACA. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went 
 25

into effect in April 2013 and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless Congress takes additional action. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Congress and the current presidential administration have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the PPACA. President Trump issued at least one Executive Order and both chambers of Congress passed bills all with the goal of fulfilling these intentions. If full or partial repeal is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the PPACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs. 
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
