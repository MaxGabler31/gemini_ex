ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General Information about Our Company
  
Concrete Leveling Services, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated on August 28, 2007 in the State of Nevada. The Company's principal offices are located at 5046 East Boulevard Northwest, Canton, Ohio 44718. In Ohio, the Company does business under the trade name of CLS Fabricating, Inc. On March 24, 2017, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement, whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Jericho Associates, Inc. (“Jericho”), a company operating in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries, in exchange for 7,151,416 shares of our common stock which were contingently issued to the shareholders of Jericho.  In July 2017, an additional 481,000 shares were issued to shareholders of Jericho under the same contingencies as the original shares.  The Equity Purchase Agreement provided that by September 24, 2017, if the management of Jericho does not identify, and close at least one entity or business opportunity for acquisition, in order to supplement the Company’s current business operations, the shares issued as part of the agreement shall be returned to the Company and the transaction will be nullified.  On September 22, 2017, the Company and Jericho mutually agreed to extend the performance requirement until December 24, 2017.

On February 25, 2018, Jericho identified the acquisition of 50% interests in two LLCs (the “LLCs”). The LLCs have a Term Sheet agreement to develop a casino and hotel resort, and provide certain gaming equipment on a shared profit basis.

On October 18,2018,Jericho advanced $232,500 of the $300,000 interim loan to VegasWinners, Inc.

Principal Services
 Once the transaction with Jericho finalizes, the Company will operate three business divisions, which will be operated simultaneously and consist of the following:
 

 The concrete leveling business will fabricate and market a concrete leveling service unit utilized in the concrete leveling industry. This unit secures to the back of a truck and consists of a mixing device to mix lime with water and a pumping device capable of pumping the mixture under pressure into pre-drilled holes in order to raise the level of any flat concrete surface.
 
The gaming and hospitality business will focus on casino gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure time industries, and will pursue opportunities in the tribal and commercial casino gaming industries, both in California and Nevada.  The Company will also operate in the casino gaming technology industry, and is seeking opportunities to partner, joint venture, or acquire companies developing casino games that combine traditional casino games with the challenge of video games and the playability of social games, meaning games that pit the player’s skill against the skill of another player as opposed to the casino itself.
 
The business of  providing sports gaming information, analysis, advice and predictions to the gaming industry and the general public, will be operated by VegasWinners, Inc..
