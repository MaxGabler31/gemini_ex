ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
We operate our business through two segments, JBT FoodTech and JBT AeroTech. We are a leading global technology solutions and service provider to high-value segments of the food, beverage, and aviation support industry. Through our FoodTech segment, our mission is to make better use of the world’s precious resources by providing solutions that substantially enhance our customers’ success, and in doing so design, produce and service sophisticated and critical products and systems for food and beverage companies that improve yields and boost efficiency. JBT also sells critical equipment and services to domestic and international air transportation customers through our AeroTech segment. Both segments operate globally and serve multi-national and regional markets. 
We were originally incorporated as Frigoscandia, Inc. in Delaware in May 1994. Our principal executive offices are located at 70 West Madison, Suite 4400, Chicago, Illinois 60602.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

•Automated Guided Vehicle Systems. Our Automated Guided Vehicle Systems offerings include stand-alone, fully-integrated, and dual-mode robotic systems for material movement requirements with a wide variety of applications including manufacturing, warehouse, and medical facilities.
JBT AeroTech markets its solutions and services to domestic and international airport authorities, passenger airlines, airfreight and ground handling companies, defense forces and defense contractors. The product offerings of our AeroTech businesses include:
•Mobile Equipment. Our mobile air transportation equipment includes commercial and defense cargo loading, aircraft deicing, aircraft towing, and aircraft ground power and cooling systems.
•Fixed Equipment. We provide gate equipment for passenger boarding.
•Airport Services. We also maintain and enhance airport equipment, systems, and facilities.
We provide aftermarket products, parts, and services for our installed base of JBT FoodTech and JBT AeroTech equipment, including retrofits and refurbishments to accommodate the changing operational requirements of our customers. We also provide continuous, proactive service to our customers including the fulfillment of preventative maintenance agreements, such as ProCare, and consulting services. As part of our aftermarket program, we offer technology for enterprise asset management and real-time operations monitoring with iOPS™.
Sales and Marketing
We sell and market our products and services predominantly through a direct sales force, supplemented with independent distributors, sales representatives, and technical service team. Our experienced global sales force is comprised of individuals with strong technical expertise in our products and services and the industries in which they are sold.
We support our sales force with marketing and training programs that are designed to increase awareness of our product offerings and highlight our differentiation while providing a set of sales tools to aid in the sales of our technology solutions. We actively employ a broad range of marketing programs to inform and educate customers, the media, industry analysts, and academia through targeted newsletters, our web-site, seminars, trade shows, user groups, and conferences. We regularly introduce new internal digital resources designed to accelerate the quote-to-order process, identify cross-selling opportunities between our separate businesses. In addition, we utilize marketing automation processes and technology to drive lead generation.
Competition
We conduct business worldwide and compete with large multinational companies as well as a variety of local and regional companies, which typically are focused on a specific application, technology or geographical area.
We compete by leveraging our industry expertise to provide differentiated and proprietary technology, integrated systems, high product quality and reliability, and comprehensive aftermarket service. We strive to provide our customers with equipment that delivers a lower total cost of ownership, distinguishing ourselves by providing reliable uptime, labor reduction through automation, increased yields, and improved product quality, while helping customers achieve ambitious environmental goals of lowering energy and water usage, reducing food waste, and enhancing food safety. Our ability to provide comprehensive sales and service in all major regions of the world, by maintaining local personnel in region, differentiates us from regional competition.
Our historically strong position in the markets we serve has provided us with a large installed base of systems and equipment. The installed base of our equipment is a source of recurring revenue from aftermarket products, parts, services, and lease arrangements. Recurring revenue accounted for 47% of our FoodTech total revenue and 38% of our AeroTech total revenue in 2021. The installed base also provides us with strong, long-term customer relationships from which we derive information for new product development to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
Geographic Information 
We have operations strategically positioned around the world to serve the existing JBT FoodTech and JBT AeroTech equipment base located in more than 100 countries. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our global operations.
Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.
Government Contracts
AeroTech supplies equipment to the U.S. Department of Defense and international forces. The amount of equipment and parts supplied to these programs is dependent upon annual government appropriations and levels of defense spending. In addition, United States defense contracts are unilaterally terminable at the option of the United States government with compensation for work completed and costs incurred. Contracts with the United States government and defense contractors are subject to special laws and regulations, the noncompliance with which may result in various sanctions that could materially affect our ongoing government business.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a number of United States and foreign patents, trademarks, and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business. We own approximately 694 United States and foreign issued patents and have approximately 338 patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Further, we license certain intellectual property rights to or from third parties. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names and have approximately 960 registrations and pending applications in the United States and abroad. A substantial majority of these patents, trademarks and tradenames are associated with the FoodTech segment. Developing and maintaining a strong intellectual property portfolio is an important component of our strategy to extend our technology leadership. However, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents, trademarks, or licenses would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
All of our business segments purchase carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and/or steel castings and forgings both domestically and internationally. We do not use single source suppliers for the majority of our raw material purchases and believe the available supplies of raw materials are adequate to meet our needs. However, the disruptions to the global economy from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have impeded global supply chains resulting in longer lead times and increased raw material costs. We expect supply chain disruptions to continue into 2022, the effect of which will depend in part on our ability to successfully mitigate and offset the impact of these events.
Working Capital Practices
In order to provide, and install, custom designed equipment, companies in the food machinery industry generally generate customer deposits, or advance payments, before construction begins. For this reason, FoodTech can be less working capital intensive than many other industrial capital goods industries. AeroTech solutions, which are more standardized, do not generate a significant amount of advance payment from the air transportation industry, and therefore work in this segment is generally more capital intensive.
Human Capital Management
We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2021, we have approximately 6,600 employees worldwide, with approximately 3,600 located in the United States. Approximately 8% of our employees in the United States are represented by three collective bargaining agreements, and less than 2% of employees in the United States are represented by agreements that will expire within a year. Outside the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. Approximately 49% of our international employees are covered by global employee representation bodies. We have historically maintained good employee relations and have successfully concluded all of our recent negotiations without a work stoppage. However, we cannot predict the outcome of future contract negotiations.
Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to our uncompromising values of integrity, accountability, continuous improvement, teamwork, and customer focus, provide the foundation of our company’s success. Employee safety, and managing the risks associated with our workplace, is of paramount importance to JBT. We give employees the training and tools to manage risk. We also empower employees to stop work if they encounter an unsafe situation. JBT's Health and Safety program operates under management's belief that all injuries can be prevented, with a company objective of "Zero Incidents, Worldwide, Every Day.” Specifically, we have deployed a global Near Miss reporting program, under which potential unsafe conditions or behaviors are proactively reported and corrected before they cause an injury. JBT's foundational commitment to safety is demonstrated by our world-class recordable and loss-time rates below. This safety information is provided in the CEO report to the Board of Directors at every Board meeting. 
JBT embraces diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI"), and we believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment filled with unique perspectives. We are committed to creating an inclusive culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work and we strive to use our resources to support causes that help to create a respectful and accepting global community. As part of JBT’s commitment to DEI, we established a global DEI Council in 2021 that partners with our executive management team to develop and deploy programs, processes and communications to further our DEI objectives. Specifically, we have partnered with Dr. Arin Reeves with Nextions LLC, an industry leader in DEI, to continue with our deployment of the JBT Inclusive Leadership Series (ILS). The ILS is a 6-session program that focuses on providing a series of structured and interactive leadership training session to leaders across the organization, with the primary objective to help JBT leaders incorporate inclusive practices into the way leaders manage their teams. We are also focused on recruitment of diverse candidates as well as on internal talent development of our diverse leaders so that they can advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company. In addition, we announced the JBT Tom Giacomini Engineering Scholarship Program in 2021 to provide twelve annual individual scholarships to minority students pursuing an engineering degree that are currently members of one of three national 
organizations: the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).
We invest in programs and processes that develop our employees' capabilities to ensure that we have the talent we need to execute our strategic business plans. Our executive Performance Management Program ensures that all leaders have clear priorities, and that their performance relative to these priorities are linked to their total rewards package. Our annual Leadership Development Process include talent discussions in each of our businesses and corporate functions and culminates in a talent review with the executive leadership team and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The result is a specific and actionable talent plan in every business that ensures the execution of the important priorities set for each business. In addition this review process includes discussions on management succession planning, retention risk and potential organization design based on employee performance. Our Leader Excellence Program provides an overview of the 13 competencies that have been identified in successful JBT leaders and deploys a formal framework through which these traits can be assessed and developed more broadly in our workforce. This ensures a fair, accurate and consistent approach in the development and assessment of leaders and potential leaders. 
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy. Our CEO and segment leaders have significant industry experience and are supported by experienced and talented management teams who are dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in our markets. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see “Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of environmental quality. If we fail to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, administrative, civil, and criminal penalties may be imposed, and we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders. We may also be subject to civil claims arising out of an accident or other event causing environmental pollution. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our own acts even though these actions were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. 
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA, and related state laws and regulations, joint and several liability can be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a contaminated site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, including hazardous substances generated by any closed operations or facilities. In addition, neighboring landowners or other third parties may file claims for personal injury, property damage, and recovery of response cost. We may also be subject to the corrective action provisions of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste to clean up releases of hazardous waste constituents into the environment associated with their operations.
Many of our facilities and operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to worker health and workplace safety, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA. We believe that appropriate precautions are taken to protect our employees and others from harmful exposure to potentially hazardous work environments, and that we operate in substantial compliance with all OSHA or similar regulations.
We are also subject to laws and regulations related to conflict minerals, forced labor, export compliance, anti-corruption, and immigration and we have adopted policies, procedures and employee training programs that are designed to facilitate compliance with those laws and regulations.
