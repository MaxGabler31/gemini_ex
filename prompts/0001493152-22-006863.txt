Summary of Risk Factors
 
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below concerning our planned cannabis operations, in addition to the risks described under “Item 1A – “Risk Factors,” before deciding to invest in our securities.
 
Set forth below is a summary of some of the principal risks we face with respect to our business:
 

● | Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt unless we obtain adequate new debt or equity financing and achieve sufficient sales levels; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We are a new participant in the cannabis industry and the sporting goods industry, and we may be unsuccessful in completing the necessary transactions or obtaining the requisite acquisitions or licenses and permits needed to operate as planned. 
● | Because of our lack of operating history and the relative infancy of the cannabis industry, investors may be unable to evaluate our prospects or an investment in us. 
● | We intend to focus our operations on a small number of industries, with a present intent to focus on cannabis operations, and the lack of diversification exposes us to risk, particularly given the regulatory uncertainty in that industry. 
● | Our management lacks experience operating a cannabis business, and we will need to attract, hire and compensate qualified personnel to meet our business objectives. 
● | We face intense competition in a relatively new and rapidly evolving industry from larger competitors with longer operating histories, greater access to capital and human resources and vertically integrated cannabis operations, as well as smaller unregulated market participants. 
● | Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law which preempts more permissive state and local laws to the extent federal laws are enforced, and legislation, regulation and enforcement policies of cannabis could change in manners adverse to us and the industry. 
● | We may be subject to action by the U.S. federal government through a number of agencies for participation in the cannabis industry, including the FDA, DEA, ATF and IRS. 
● | U.S. state and local regulation of cannabis is robust, uncertain and constantly evolving, and uniform compliance across jurisdictions may be difficult or impossible to achieve. 
● | State regulatory agencies may require us to post bonds or significant fees to operate. 
● | We will be subject to limitations, challenges and associated costs imposed by state and local governments on the ownership, operation and maintenance of cannabis licenses. 
● | Because cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law, we may be unable to access to certain benefits available to non-cannabis companies, such as access to financial institutions and federal tax exemptions. 
● | Because our contracts will involve cannabis and related activities, which are not legal under U.S. federal law, we may face difficulties in enforcing our contracts. 
● | We may be subject to varying restrictions on marketing the cannabis products we attempt to sell in varying state and local jurisdictions. 
● | The results of future clinical research and scientific articles may be unfavorable to cannabis products, which may have a material, adverse effect on the demand for our products. 
● | Inconsistent public opinion and perception of cannabis could hinder market growth and state adoption of permissive laws regulating its use.

● | If our operations are found to be in violation of applicable anti-money laundering laws and our revenues or proceeds are viewed as proceeds of crime, we may be unable to effect distributions or reinvest amounts we receive into our business. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We anticipate requiring additional financing to operate and expand our cannabis business, and we may face difficulties acquiring additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, and any financing we undertake could substantially dilute our existing investors or otherwise have an adverse impact on their holdings. 
● | Disparate state-by-state regulatory landscapes may require us to implement operational, transactional or corporate structures that expose us to revenue-related and other risks. 
● | The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully acquire complementary cannabis businesses and assets, integrate acquired businesses and navigate other risks inherent in acquisitions in the cannabis industry and in general. 
● | We will face security risks related to our planned cannabis dispensaries and operations, including with respect to both physical locations and information technology with respect to data privacy and security and related laws and regulations. 
● | We face exposure to fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors, consultants, and agents, which may subject us to investigations and actions. 
● | We face risks related to the novelty of the cannabis industry, and the resulting lack of information regarding comparable businesses, unanticipated expenses, difficulties and delays, and the offering of new products in a relatively untested market. 
● | We will be dependent on obtaining, developing and sustaining an attractive product line and brand portfolio, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so on economically feasible terms or at all. 
● | We face risks related to our need for adequate insurance coverage and the possibility for uninsured or underinsured losses. 
● | Our ability to operate as intended will be dependent upon third party suppliers, and may be negatively impacted by or our suppliers’ inability to produce and ship products at the necessary quality levels or within prescribed timeframes. 
● | We are subject to risks and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to reduced demand, economic hardship and our expected focus on retail cannabis sales. 
● | We may be subject to product liability or intellectual property which may be costly and/or divert management’s time and attention from important operational matters. 
● | Our intellectual property rights may be difficult to protect. 
● | Our products may be subject to product recalls, which may result in expenses, legal proceedings, regulatory action, loss of sales, reputational harm, and diversion of management’s attention. 
● | Synthetic products from the pharmaceutical industry may compete with cannabis use and products. 
● | Due to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile. 
● | Trading in our common stock is limited, and sales of our common stock may dilute our current investors’ holdings and/or depress our stock price. 
● | Future issuances of our common stock, which we may effect to raise capital or for other reasons, could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders. 

 
These and other material risks we face are described more fully in Item 1A. – Risk Factors, which investors should carefully review prior to making an investment decision with respect to the Company or its securities.

Description of Business
 
The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “registrant,” “Fortium Holdings”, and the “Company” refer to Fortium Holdings Corp. (formerly Banner Energy Services, Corp. “Banner Energy”)), a Nevada corporation. Set forth below is an overview of the Company’s corporate history and business development. Because of our focus on our new cannabis business, much of the following discussion, including regarding the competitive and regulatory environment we face, is focused on that business and the cannabis industry.
 
On November 18, 2019, the Company merged with Banner Midstream Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Banner Midstream”). Banner Midstream then had two operating subsidiaries: Pinnacle Frac Transport LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Pinnacle Frac”) and Capstone Equipment Leasing LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Capstone”) as of November 18, 2019.
 
Additionally, immediately following the closing of the merger, the Company and its secured debt holders finalized an agreement whereby the debt holders took possession of the Company’s biotechnology assets and assumed certain other Company obligations in lieu of payment by the Company of the amounts due in the secured debt instruments.
 
On March 27, 2020, Banner Midstream was acquired by Ecoark Holdings, Inc., (“Ecoark”) pursuant a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 27, 2020 (the “Banner Purchase Agreement”), between Ecoark and Banner Energy. Pursuant to the Banner Purchase Agreement, Ecoark acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Banner Midstream in consideration for 1,789,041 shares of common stock of Ecoark valued at $2.72 per share and assumed approximately $11,774,000 in short-term and long-term debt of Banner Midstream and its subsidiaries.


As a result of the Banner Purchase Agreement, the Company did not have any operating subsidiaries from March 28, 2020 until March 18, 2021, when the Company formed Norr LLC (“Norr”), a Nevada limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and commenced operations as a sports equipment and apparel manufacturer and retailer. Prior to organization of Norr, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer had explored this business opportunity and commenced preparation of a business plan for the business. On March 23, 2021, the Company engaged the services of two consultants and entered into consulting agreements through Norr pursuant to which each consultant provides services to Norr which were subsequently replaced in December 2021 when we also added a third independent contractor to assist in our Norr business. The terms of these services and compensation are more fully described below.
 
On September 9, 2021, the Company formed Elysian Premium Corp., a Colorado corporation (“Elysian”). On September 14, 2021, Elysian entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Treehouse Company, Inc. (“Treehouse”), and its sole shareholder Alex Gosselin (the “Seller”) pursuant to which Elysian agreed to purchase 80% of the capital stock of Treehouse from the Seller for $200,000. Treehouse’s key assets consist of two licenses for commercial cannabis distribution in the State of California, license numbers C11-0000999 and C9-0000379. The acquisition of Treehouse will close upon delivery of the $200,000 purchase price to the escrow agent to be held until release upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approval for the transaction. As of March 9, 2022, the acquisition has not closed.
 
Simultaneously with the SPA, Elysian and the Seller entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Treehouse pursuant to which the parties agreed that Elysian will purchase the remaining 20% of the capital stock of Treehouse for an additional $200,000 and enter into a second Stock Purchase Agreement on substantially similar terms to the SPA in connection therewith, subject to state and local regulatory clearance of the transfer of ownership of the two cannabis licenses owned by Treehouse. The SPA provides that if required state and local regulatory clearance is not obtained, the SPA will terminate, Elysian will return the Treehouse capital stock to the Seller and the Seller will return the $200,000 purchase price to Elysian.
 
On December 2, 2021, Elysian, the Company, 7Seeds Inc. (“7Seeds”), and Firebreak Associates, Inc. (“Firebreak”) (collectively, the “Parties”) entered into a joint venture agreement (the “JVA”). Pursuant to the JVA, 7Seeds, Firebreak and Elysian agreed to cooperate in the opening and operation of cannabis distribution facilities as follows: (i) 7Seeds agreed to provide consulting services to Elysian for an initial term of 36 months, including identifying locations to open new commercial cannabis businesses, including without limitation dispensaries, delivery stores, and other businesses engaging in cannabis related activities (the “Elysian Stores”), securing proper state and local licensure, planning commercial cannabis business operations at those locations in exchange for the compensation described below, and (ii) Firebreak, as the owner of certain trademarks and service marks (the “CannaBlue Marks”), licensed the CannaBlue Marks to Elysian for an initial term of five years, pursuant to which Elysian obtained the option to open the Elysian Stores under the name “CannaBlue” and making use of the CannaBlue Marks. The Elysian Stores will be owned and operated entirely by Elysian or its affiliates. The license for the CannaBlue Marks under the JVA is for use in connection with retail Elysian Stores and related activities in the United States, subject to the following exceptions: (i) a 99-mile radius from each of Oakland, CA and South Lake Tahoe, CA are excluded from the permitted territory in which Elysian may use the license; (ii) the license excludes the use of CannaBlue Marks for online stores and related activities from the permitted uses, and (iii) the license to use the Cannablue marks is non-exclusive with respect to (A) the online promotion, advertising, and sales of products bearing the Cannablue Marks; and (B) the sale and distribution of Firebreak’s private label products by licensed cannabis distributors.

In exchange for the license, Elysian has agreed to pay Firebreak a $5,000 annual license fee, and a quarterly royalty fee equal to the greater of 6% of gross sales or $5,000 for each Cannablue-branded Elysian Store that did not directly result from the consulting services of 7Seeds. In exchange for the consulting services, Elysian has agreed to pay 7Seeds a monthly fee beginning at $5,000 to be incrementally increased up to $15,000 during the initial term of the services. Further, for each Elysian Store for which 7Seeds directly assists in obtaining a cannabis license (exclusive of California license numbers C11-0000999 and C9-0000379), Elysian has agreed to pay 7Seeds a one-time issuance of $50,000 in shares of Fortium’s common stock and a quarterly royalty fee of 6% of gross sales.
 
In December 2021, Norr entered into a term sheet for an Advisory Agreement with three individual contractors. The Advisory Agreements, were effective upon the signing of the definitive documents on January 24, 2022 and are for a period of five years. If any advisor voluntarily or involuntarily terminates his services, his agreement will automatically terminate. All advisors will be paid $1,000 per month for the first eighteen months immediately following execution of the Advisory Agreement. In addition to the cash compensation, the Company shall compensate the advisors who have not terminated their relationship with Norr based on the following events (amounts have been aggregated among the advisors):
 

(a) | Upon the first $1 of revenue generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in 5% ownership of Norr; 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Upon the first $100,000 of revenue generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in an additional 5% ownership of Norr; 
(c) | Upon the first $250,000 of revenue generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in an additional 5% ownership of Norr; 
(d) | Upon the first $500,000 of revenue generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in an additional 5% ownership of Norr; 
(e) | Upon the first $1,000,000 of revenue generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in an additional 5% ownership of Norr; 
(f) | Upon the first $1,000,000 of net operating free cash flow generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in $200,000 of common stock in the Company; and 
(g) | Upon the first $2,500,000 of net operating free cash flow generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in an additional $300,000 of common stock in the Company; and 
(h) | Upon the first $5,000,000 of net operating free cash flow generated within Norr, the advisors will vest in an additional $400,000 of common stock in the Company. 

 
The maximum ownership the advisors may collectively in Norr shall be 25%.
 
In addition, the advisors may receive shares of Fortium common stock based on meeting enumerated net operating free cash flow thresholds ranging from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, for a total potential Fortium equity compensation to these advisors of up to $900,000 of shares of Fortium common stock.

On March 8, 2022, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby the Company paid a non-refundable $50,000 purchase price to Firebreak Associates, Inc. in exchange for a total of 5% equity in any of the corporations that Firebreak Associates, Inc. controls if they are selected through the State of California’s retail cannabis license lottery process in Encinitas, California.


The Company is subject to a number of risks, including the need to develop the Elysian and Norr businesses and/or acquire and successfully operate a new business, the risk of our need for additional capital and potentially attempting to raise such capital through equity and/or debt financings. See Part II, Item 1A, herein and Item 1A “Risk Factors” included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed February 4, 2021.
 
On July 31, 2020, Mr. Jay Puchir notified the Board of Directors (the “Board”) that he was resigning as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On July 31, 2020, the Board appointed Mr. Richard Horgan as the Chief Executive Officer, and as our sole director and Chairman of the Board, effective August 1, 2020.
 
On January 7, 2021, shareholders of the Company representing approximately 57% of the outstanding common shares, acted by written consent in lieu of a meeting to approve an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Fortium Holdings Corp. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved the name change on May 18, 2021.
 
Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to grow our operations, particularly as we shift our focus towards the retail sale of cannabis products. The cannabis retail industry is fiercely competitive, as a growing number of companies, including many larger, well-capitalized cannabis retail companies, have entered the market in an attempt to capitalize on more lenient government restrictions in the United States compared to prior periods. We also face competition from companies which offer a broader range of products than we intend to market in our cannabis operations, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetic products and wellness products. Among the barriers to entry is the requirement to be licensed in state and local jurisdictions. To this end, we are in the process of acquiring two commercial cannabis licenses in California.
 
Numerous other factors are expected to be critical to our ability to be competitive in this endeavor, including product quality and prices, brand strength, production and distribution capabilities and geographic scope of operations and market presence. Additionally, market conditions can shift demand for cannabis products, such as competitive pricing, the effects of inflation, regulatory changes and economic or geopolitical turmoil. In the short-term we intend to focus our commercial cannabis efforts in a single state, California, which may render us at a relative competitive disadvantage when compared to other cannabis retail companies whose operations expand into a larger geographic territory for a number of reasons including longer operating histories, greater access to capital, industry relationships, brand recognition and others. In addition, many competitors are able to commercialize their cannabis products through online sales, which we will not be able to do using the Cannablue Marks due to restrictions in the JVA that provides for the license. Additionally, many of our competitors are more vertically integrated, including some with “seed-to-sale” operations in which they cultivate, produce, sell or distribute their cannabis or cannabis-related products entirely or mostly in-house or by using a well-structured network of interrelated parties, which allows them to enjoy reduced operational costs and a higher volume of sales than is anticipated for our planned cannabis operations. Alternatively, we expect to depend on third parties to obtain products to sell at our stores, and on the development and maintenance of key business and industry relationships in order to execute our business plan, including opening new stores and potentially expanding to new regions in the future.
 
With respect to our Norr operations, we face competition from larger competitors with longer operating histories, greater access to capital and human resources and vertically integrated sporting goods operations, including many larger retail and online companies which offer a broader range of sporting and athletic gear and apparel than our Norr product offerings. We also face competition from smaller online and retail businesses which offer similar products to ours. Because of these competitive conditions and our limited capital, we currently focus on online sales for our Norr products.

Government Regulation
 
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions where the Company is currently operating through its subsidiaries.
 
U.S. Federal Regulation of Cannabis 
 
The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I controlled substances are federally illegal and the manufacturing, sale and use of cannabis is a violation of federal law.
 
Due to the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, cannabis businesses are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. The Obama Administration attempted to address these inconsistencies in the Cole Memorandum that Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. Attorneys in August 2013, which outlined certain priorities for the Department of Justice relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum noted that, in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with such laws and regulations was not a prosecution or enforcement priority for the Department of Justice. However, the Department of Justice did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum. However, on January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a new memorandum which rescinded the Cole Memorandum, largely restoring the uncertainty as to potential federal regulatory enforcement on the cannabis industry.
 
While there have been efforts to reform federal cannabis law, including bills proposed in Congress which would address multiple issues regarding the cannabis industry, from banking and tax reform to full legalization, as of the date of this Report, none have been passed into law. Therefore, as of the date of this Report, cannabis remains illegal under federal law, although federal enforcement policies have largely deferred to state regulations which are discussed below.
 
State Cannabis Law 
 
State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for medicinal and adult use are in direct conflict with federal law. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and/or adult use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia are criminal acts under the Controlled Substances Act. Although the Company plans to only engage in cannabis-related activities that are compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may not absolve us of liability or enforcement actions under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any proceeding that may be brought against the Company.
California
 
Our initial cannabis operations are planned to commence in California, subject to satisfaction of closing and post-closing conditions including the receipt of the required regulatory approval of our acquisition of Treehouse and its two licenses. In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. In 2016, voters in California passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”) in June 2017, essentially combining the AUMA with the MCRSA to provide a single set of regulations to govern a medical and adult use licensing. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018.


In order to legally operate a medicinal or adult use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing programs. Municipalities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators or can choose to ban cannabis businesses outright.
 
There are three principal license categories in California: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) retailer. Each of the two Treehouse licenses are retailer licenses, which permit the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to both medical patients and adult use customers. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any adult 21 years of age or older.
 
We intend to follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by California.


Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we have one employee, our Chief Executive Officer.
