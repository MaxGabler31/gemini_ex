ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Mission



Our mission is to re-humanize healthcare by enabling doctors to practice medicine that is centered on patients. Our solution helps relieve the burden of medical note documentation so that doctors can focus on what they do best — patient care.
Overview



The medical note documentation burden in the United States is significant and is a major contributor to physician burnout. According to a 2019 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, physician burnout costs the U.S. healthcare industry $4.6 billion per year due to lost productivity and higher turnover, with the cost of replacing a single physician estimated to be between $100,000 and $1 million. It also is adversely impacting industry productivity because the considerable amount of time spent on documentation could be better utilized by seeing more patients.



Physicians and health systems in the United States often turn to 3rd party service providers and “Health IT” solutions to alleviate these swelling documentation burdens. Available solutions range in scope from in-person human scribing services, physically present at the point of care, to Health IT solutions such as single-party dictation and ambient documentation solutions. We are a provider of ambient documentation solutions that are uniquely able to convert the natural conversation between physicians and patients into timely and comprehensive medical notes.



Augmedix, Inc. was incorporated in 2013 and launched its commercial synchronous, remote documentation services in 2014. Clinicians access our applications through mobile devices such as smartphones or Google Glass. Once accessed, the client application provides clinicians with a secure communication channel and the visit is live-streamed to the Ambient Automation Platform (“AAP”). The AAP houses our note creation software and is overseen by our Medical Documentation Specialists (“MDSs”). Proprietary Natural Language Processing (“NLP”) technology, with assistance from the MDS, identifies, classifies and extracts the relevant medical elements from the natural clinician patient interaction. These elements are used by our proprietary note creation tool “Notebuilder” to automatically generate the medical note, which, when completed, is uploaded into the patient’s chart contained within the electronic health record (“EHR") system. The EHR system (e.g. Epic) is third-party software licensed by the healthcare clinic or system to manage patient charts.



Patient care in the United States is principally provided in ambulatory or clinical environments and hospitals. We focus most of our efforts in the ambulatory/clinical segment of the patient care market. Roughly 75% of the physicians who subscribe to our service are employed directly by, or are affiliated with, a healthcare enterprise. The remaining 25% consists of small practices and individual practitioners.



We have generated in excess of five million medical notes since we began offering our service and are currently delivering over 40,000 notes to our customers each week. We estimate that our solution saves doctors two to three hours each day, which is time that they can redeploy to see more patients or improve their work-life balance. We believe the principal benefits to healthcare enterprises from our services are increased productivity and higher clinician and patient satisfaction.



The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting safety protocols have prompted an accelerated shift towards delivering health services remotely via telemedicine. Our technology platform was designed to enable synchronous, two-way communication between remotely located participants. We believe telemedicine will remain an important part of health services delivery even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also served as a catalyst for the industry’s adoption of virtual solutions such as ours.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required modifications to how we deliver our service. While our general business model is to house MDSs within centralized operating centers, local shelter-in-place orders and safety restrictions have required us to shift to work-from-home for most employees and contracted employees. We will continue our work from home model until and to the extent that local conditions allow for more employees to safely work from our operations centers. Further, we instituted additional system controls to ensure compliance with our privacy practices.



Our technology vision is to automate as much of the medical note creation process as possible by combining artificial intelligence technologies, such as automated speech recognition and natural language processing, with structured data models. While the unstructured nature of a conversation between physician and patient creates challenges to fully automating the process, we believe that increasing levels of automation generate significant benefits including improved operating efficiencies, higher-quality medical notes, and a more uniform level of note quality.



Our automation approach is based upon our belief that some level of human interaction is currently a necessary part of a high quality note creation process. We train our MDSs to be experts at using our technology tools to consistently and efficiently deliver high quality comprehensive medical notes. 



Our Industry



Accurate medical records are indispensable to quality patient care. The cornerstone of any medical record system is proper recording of a patient’s examination as it occurs. Pen and paper, either in the hands of a physician or an in-person documentation specialist, was the traditional method of producing medical notes, but in the hands of a caregiver, this method can be both time consuming and subject to subsequent misinterpretation due to illegibility or other factors. Misinterpretation of the information can lead to confusion regarding the patient’s condition and/or clinician services provided. Further, there has been a significant increase in the volume of medical information required as well as an increase in the number of recipients.



The advent of computerized record systems that are now an integral part of the healthcare landscape as a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) has ushered in a new era of record keeping in which medical records are stored as electronic text and data that enhances legibility and has the potential to be more thorough. Furthermore, computerized record systems can be instantly accessed by numerous practitioners at the same time, which has enabled medical practitioners to instantly share medical records with each other for mutually served patients.



The enormous resources expended on medical documentation has burdened the healthcare industry and caused many organizations, as well as individual practitioners, to look towards 3rd party service providers and Health IT solutions. Existing EHR medical record systems are generally cumbersome for practitioners to use due to their highly structured nature and regimented user interfaces, which can restrict data entry and be quite time consuming. Today, we estimate that up to one-third of a doctor’s day is consumed by the required and complex interactions with the EHR. This can lead to many physicians authoring their notes hours or days after the actual patient visit. Physicians also need to invest significant time to familiarize themselves with the EHR whenever a new EHR is adopted or whenever an update to an existing EHR is introduced. These issues are compounded by the fragmented nature of the EHR space, with over 700 different EHRs available in the United States, the largest of which are Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH, and Allscripts.



The principal legacy tools and solutions to address the EHR burden are not ideally suited to the changing U.S. healthcare landscape. Automated single-party dictation tools (e.g. Dragon) have evolved such that they convert speech to text, using pure software, with minimal errors, however, they demand a great deal of the clinician’s time to pedantically speak word-for-word and convert the relevant aspects of their interactions with patients into a cogent, accurate, and comprehensive medical note. In-person human scribes, present at the point of care, have emerged as a prevalent out-sourced solution, but the practice of using in-person scribes, has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the ability for such personnel to be physically present. Furthermore, the use of in-person scribes has proven increasingly costly, cumbersome, and difficult to scale.



Our Opportunity



We primarily serve the ambulatory/clinical segment of the U.S. patient care services market with solutions that address medical note documentation needs. Our solutions cater to large and small healthcare organizations but can also be adopted by individual practitioners. There are approximately 1.1 million physicians in the United States and approximately 88% of these, or 980,000, work within the specialties that we currently serve. Of these, approximately 30%, or 295,000 (who manage approximately 1.2 billion patient visits annually), fall within the productivity parameters we establish as the best prospects for realizing the highest productivity gains from utilizing our service. At the $1,800 average monthly subscription price per clinician of our two products, we believe that our total addressable market in the United States is approximately $6.0 billion annually.



Our existing enterprise customers employ directly, or are affiliated with, approximately 200,000 physicians. We estimate there are about 50,000 addressable physicians within this group, which translates roughly to a $1.0 billion opportunity annually. As such, our existing enterprise healthcare customers represent about 17% of the total U.S. addressable market.



In addition to physicians who work in the ambulatory or clinical setting of healthcare centers, there are approximately 57,000 emergency department physicians in the United States today. We successfully tested our emergency department offering during the second half of 2020. We currently serve an emergency department veterinary client and recently initiated an emergency department pilot at one of the twenty largest health systems in the U.S. Penetration of this segment would increase the size of our total addressable market.

The Benefits of our Services



The core value of our service is relieving the medical note documentation burden placed on clinicians. According to Physician Compensation Report and National Physician Report, it is estimated that clinicians spent one-third of their day on non-revenue generating documentation activity in 2019. Our solutions enable clinicians to reclaim this time while improving medical documentation and quality measures for reimbursement. We believe our solutions lead to higher patient satisfaction, as clinicians can focus their entire attention on their patients instead of having to disrupt the natural flow of discourse in order to write, type or dictate the medical note themselves during the visit.



For our Live (as defined below) customers, we also provide care gap reminders, orders and referrals, which enhance our value proposition and help distinguish us from competing offerings. Care gap reminders are text notifications we provide physicians during their interactions with patients that point out areas that should be addressed by the physician with the patient. Our MDSs source the information for such reminders from the patient’s EHR, which physicians sometimes do not have time to review thoroughly prior to the patient visit. Examples of reminders include notifications of medication contraindications, vaccinations or preventive screening tests that are due.



Our value proposition is anchored on the time savings we generate for our users. We can save certain clinicians up to two to three hours per day in paperwork administration, depending on their patient volume. Our documentation solution increases productivity by up to 20% as well as increases certain clinicians’ satisfaction with work-life balance by 49%, according to internal management studies and customer satisfaction surveys. We have created a data driven sales approach with health systems to evaluate productivity and charting efficiency of all eligible providers. Understanding each individual clinician’s efficiency enables us to clearly identify their potential productivity boost and provide the health system with a credible estimate of the expected ROI at the enterprise level by adopting our solutions.



Our service has demonstrated its effect on improving the top-line of our enterprise customers. Based upon actual results of a study we conducted of a representative cohort of 100 physicians from one of our enterprise customers, our service can be expected to generate an estimated $4.12 million of net revenue over a 12-month period for every cohort of 100 doctors, made up of 63 primary care physicians and 37 specialty doctors. For these purposes, we define net revenue as the gross improvement in revenue less the fees paid to Augmedix. The same study showed an average increase in hourly productivity of 14.8% and 16.1% for primary care physicians and specialists, respectively. We believe the economic benefit from productivity gains, coupled with increased clinician satisfaction and the inherent tight integration into their workflows, are the primary drivers behind our high net revenue retention rate, which stood at 135% as of the quarter ended December 31, 2021.



What Sets Us Apart



Since we developed our concept of virtual, synchronous medical note documentation from natural physician-patient conversations, several companies have since entered the field. To varying degrees, each offers a solution that addresses the documentation burden faced by physicians. We believe that our service is distinct from these other competitive solutions because our solution addresses every aspect of the documentation burden placed upon clinicians.



Importantly, we create our notes from the ambient conversation between physician and patient as the input source for the medical notes we produce through our platform. This results in the greatest time savings for physicians, as they do not have to expend time on extraneous functions to transmit the information to us (i.e., they don’t have to perform time-consuming verbatim dictations post visit or at the end of the day). Allowing for a natural physician-patient discussion, also results in higher patient satisfaction since physicians are not required to alter their natural interaction with patients.



In addition to relying upon the ambient conversation between physician and patient, we offer both real-time synchronous and asynchronous solutions. Few competitors do both as synchronous solutions are highly challenging to develop from a logistical and technical perspective.



Our breadth of services, which is enabled by our ability to offer real-time, synchronous solutions, with 2-way interactivity capabilities, exceeds that of those players who do not have that capability. Our platform enables us to offer care gap reminders, orders and referrals, among other services; these offerings, are viewed as vitally important by many physicians. Most competitive solutions emerging on the market offer the basic note, and little more. 





3







Finally, our operational and technical flexibility enable us to serve over 35 specialties across more than 50 EHRs in a wide variety of care settings, including acute settings. This provides us a significant competitive advantage as this flexibility allows us to accommodate a very wide range of clinician workflows. Most competitive offerings support a much narrower band of specialties and often underperform in complex multi-problem visits. Further, few competitive solutions offer support for acute/hospital settings; Augmedix performs very well in the hospital. 



All of these benefits are made available to clinicians without the need for them to learn any complicated new technology. Access and use of our services is as simple as logging into an application on your mobile device.



Our Services and Business Model



We provide two primary subscription services, each of which feature best practices medical note documentation. The AAP uses our proprietary Notebuilder technology to automate the note creation process, aided by our trained MDSs. The AAP allows for the delivery of timely and clinically comprehensive medical notes.

● | Augmedix Live. Our synchronous service branded “Live”, provides ambient medical note documentation and live clinical support by trained MDSs. Clinicians access the service through special-purpose mobile devices, which we furnish to them, to connect to the Augmedix platform and stream the audio and video of patient visits. Clinicians may choose to use a smartphone or Google Glass as their preferred mobile device. Medical notes are delivered into the patient’s EHR chart for final review by the clinician. MDSs operate as a member of the care team and engage in two-way communication with the clinician throughout the clinician’s shift. MDSs provide pending orders, referral letters, and care gap reminders regarding clinical matters. This service is offered as a monthly subscription with various tiers based upon committed monthly clinical hourly support. Tiers may be adjusted periodically to align with any changes to the clinician’s work schedule. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Augmedix Notes. We launched our asynchronous offering, branded “Notes,” in mid-2020. Our Notes service provides medical documentation based upon recorded visits. Clinicians access this service through the same dedicated mobile devices we furnish for our Live service but in this case, the interactions with patients are recorded rather than live-streamed. We deliver medical notes into the patient’s EHR chart for final review by the clinician no later than the next business day and generally prior to the beginning of the clinician’s next shift. This service is offered on a monthly subscription basis with pricing based upon the monthly number of clinic hours in the clinician’s schedule. Our Notes service is lower priced than our Live service. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competition



We compete on the basis of price, quality of service offered, breadth of services and flexibility in accommodating varying clinician workflows. We believe our competitors fall into three broad categories.

● | Dictation software providers. Dictation software provides a Do-It-Yourself tool for those clinicians who prefer to create their own medical notes, would rather speak them word-for-word vs. typing. Dictation is the lowest cost solution on the market but also provides the least utility and requires significant time and effort on the part of the clinician. Several of our enterprise customers also provide their clinicians with dictation tools. Examples include Dragon, an offering of Microsoft Corporation via their acquisition of Nuance, and Fluency from M-Modal, a subsidiary of 3M Corporation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ambient, non-real time asynchronous medical note generators. Ambient, non-real time solutions are substantially more costly than dictation software but provide more value to clinicians because they more accurately capture and reflect the ambient conversation between clinician and patient which they use as their primary input source. Through our Notes service, we are a participant in the ambient, non-real time segment of the market. Our Notes service differentiates itself from other market participants primarily on the basis of price, note quality and its flexibility as it relates to the clinician’s workflow. Other market participants include IKS Healthcare, AQuity, Robin Healthcare, Nuance DAX and DeepScribe. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Ambient, real time synchronous medical note documentation services. These solutions deliver the most value to physicians given their timeliness, synchronous nature and capability to offer additional interactive two-way services. Clinicians can expect to see considerable time savings by minimizing any downstream editing as any ambiguities that occur during the patient encounter are dealt with at the time they arise. The largest participant in this sector, Scribe America, provides this service in-person. In-person solutions have drawbacks, however, including personnel restrictions within many healthcare facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic safety protocols or other factors. Another major challenge is the available supply of qualified candidates to fill the role of documentation specialist, which is limited to the geographic location of the clinician, which can also contribute to the relatively high cost of such a delivery model. Additionally, some patients are uncomfortable in the presence of an unfamiliar non-clinician in the exam room. Our real time solution — Live — differentiates itself from other providers by leveraging proprietary automation technology that enables a more uniform level of note quality and delivery of ancillary services on an automated basis, and relying upon remotely located documentation specialists. Offering additional interactive services on an automated basis provides us with pricing flexibility as the marginal costs associated with such services is nominal. AQuity is another participant in this segment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy



There are over 1.1 million physicians in the United States, of which 69% work for, or are affiliated with, a health system. Our current enterprise customer accounts, together, employ directly, or have affiliations with, a total of approximately 200,000 physicians, of which we currently serve a very small fraction. Our growth strategy is focused on five areas:

● | Expand our relationship with current large physician group and health system customers. Historically, our growth has been fueled by reducing physician burnout for high producing physicians. This approach has led to steady growth since our inception. Our data-driven approach to expand existing accounts identifies physicians whose productivity is below targeted levels as a result of their documentation burden. We believe proactively identifying these physicians and demonstrating the value of our service will help accelerate growth within our existing client base. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sell new products in our existing and new health systems. The 2020 launch of Notes will help us expand our relationship with existing customers as Notes unlocks new segments of clinicians at a lower price point than our Live service. We also recently launched our Emergency Department offering that expands our total addressable market and provides a new entry point into health systems. We will continue to expand our offerings where we have data and assets that provide us a competitive advantage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sell our products to new health systems and large physician groups. Our sales team consistently seeks to identify health systems and large physician groups that we believe will benefit from our service. We believe that the attributes of potential customers most suited to our solution include physicians that struggle with documentation efficiency, customers that seek to transition to value-based care, and customers that are in geographic locations where the workforce is not suited to assist physicians with documentation due to cost, lack of skills, or scarcity of qualified staff. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Target sales to small practices and independent physicians. A portion of our potential customers include small group practices and individual physicians that are not affiliated with health systems or large physician groups. We aim to contract with these parties directly for our services using a transactional sales model. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage channel partnerships to drive sales. We believe our position in the exam room may be attractive to potential partners with adjacent offerings. Examples could include data analytics companies working to provide physicians with clinical insights, EHR companies that are trying to reduce the documentation burden their software creates, pharmaceutical companies that seek physician participation in clinical trials, practice management companies and large technology companies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology Platform



Our Technology Strategy 



Our technology strategy is focused on ultimately creating a fully-automated medical note based on the unstructured ambient conversation between the physician and patient. Our service is delivered through the Augmedix Ambient Automation Platform (AAP). The technology that we provide to clinicians is familiar and simple to operate. Clinicians are provided a single-purpose mobile device with a simple-to-use application to access our service. Each component of our technology platform, from the mobile device to the streaming data channel, the audio/video from the visit and the Notebuilder application used by the MDSs, is compliant with HIPAA standards pertaining to data security standards.



Our platform is remote and mobile thus, well-suited to support both in person and telemedicine visits. The devices that we provide to clinicians can be used to capture telemedicine visits regardless of the telehealth platform used by the clinician. We render a seamless service experience as the clinician moves from telephone calls, to video calls, to in person visits. Our devices follow the clinician ensuring that the connection between clinician and our service platform remains intact during the clinician’s entire shift.



Ambient Automation Platform 



Our technology platform consists of three primary components.




● | Clinician Device. The clinician’s interface device, either a Smartphone (“Phone”) or Google Glass (“Glass”) is used during patient encounters to enable remote audio/video feed of the visit. Our proprietary single purpose app (“Doc App”) that runs on the Phone and/or Glass unit facilitates secure communication between the clinician and the service platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Notebuilder. The audio and video stream captured through the clinician’s device is transmitted and displayed within the Notebuilder web application, our proprietary note creation software. The audio stream is passed through automated speech recognition (“ASR”) software which outputs a diarized transcript of what is said in the visit. Proprietary natural language processing (“NLP”) is applied to identify and classify the pertinent medical events. The Notebuilder application is used to create the note by combining structured data models with the medical events, as identified by the MDS and/or NLP that are applied to the transcript of the patient encounter. The MDS uses Notebuilder to make additional edits and complete quality checks on the note. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Streaming Service. The clinician device and the Notebuilder application are linked by a common layer of servers that establish HIPAA compliant secure connections and signal handling for streaming audio/visual feeds and other data interactions between the Doc App and Notebuilder web application. The visit is live streamed for the Live service and recorded for playback in the Notes service. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinician Devices and Doc App 



We provide multiple third-party device options for clinicians, each of which is configured with a proprietary Doc App. We offer a standalone Smartphone Doc App that runs on a Smartphone with an Android operating system. The Doc App provides real time streaming and instant messaging so that the MDS can communicate in real time with the clinician. We also offer a standalone Android Doc App that runs on Google Glass which also provides real time streaming and instant messaging functionality. Our system also features a third Doc App for Notes service. All versions of our Doc App contain features for connecting, communicating, and streaming audio and video to the server. All Android devices in production are locked-down to ensure the security and integrity of the device.





6







We are planning to offer our customers iOS devices with iOS compatible Doc Apps for both services with all the same features.



Notebuilder



The Notebuilder is a web application that is used by the MDSs to create medical notes. Our Notebuilder is patent pending proprietary software that uses Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technologies such as Automated Speech Recognition (“ASR”) and NLP in combination with structured medical data models to facilitate the notetaking process.



The audio and video stream captured through the clinician’s device is transmitted and displayed within the Notebuilder application. The MDS can direct-message, via a secure audio channel, clarifying questions to the clinician during the shift. All stored data is encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption at rest and TLS in transit. Storage is necessary for note preparation, note completion and quality assurance.



We use ASR to create a multi-party diarized transcript of the ambient conversation and clinician dictation recordings (clinicians sometimes choose to dictate directly to Augmedix, typically post visit). Augmedix has partnered with Google Cloud to customize a medically tuned set of ASR models to integrate into the Augmedix technology stack. Additionally, Augmedix has made further enhancements to Google’s ASR third party tools to improve transcription accuracy and relevance. The transcript between the clinician and patient is displayed within the Notebuilder application and simplifies the processing of a complex clinician-patient visit.



Notebuilder currently includes hundreds of constantly adapting note blocks that are used to document acute and chronic medical conditions; these blocks are customized to each specialty that Augmedix serves. Medical event options for each complaint or visit type template are displayed and curated based upon patient demographics and medical specialty. Notebuilder medical event selections such as complaints, symptoms, medications and treatments generate automated sentences which are then organized and presented in the appropriate note section: History of Present Illness, Physical Exam and Assessment and Plan. Selection options are dynamically filtered and adjusted based upon specialty and clinician preferences. Augmedix’s AI models adapt and improve from the selection options and dynamic filtration via production feedback loops. The Notebuilder allows for customizations of note conventions based upon specialty, clinic or clinician preferences. Completed notes are then transferred to the patient chart within the client’s EHR either automatically or manually for clinician review and sign-off.



Notebuilder datasets provide a wealth of medical data such as symptoms, medications with dosages, frequency and related side effects, as well as relevant diagnoses and treatment options. Notebuilder allows for extraction of meta data for specific cohorts that can be used for coding and/or other data services.



According to our internal studies, the Notebuilder tool allows completion of the medical note up to 50% faster than manual documentation using free text. We continue to improve the Notebuilder and other documentation tools with the intent of maximizing the level of automation employed to deliver medical notes.



Platform Architecture



We use state-of-the-art, HIPAA-secure cloud infrastructure to host all of our production applications, web services, data-channels, audio-video streaming platforms, databases, and data processing servers for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (“AI/ML”). We use a WebRTC platform that employs Android and JavaScript WebRTC SDKs to enable highly secure audio and video for our service.
Audio Video Streaming Service



Our platform is hosted inside a HIPAA-secure third-party cloud infrastructure. Communication to and from our platform is encrypted end-to-end and aligned with HIPAA regulations. Each streaming server is load balanced and has redundant capacity to ensure 100% fault tolerance. We provide periodic updates to the platform. If applicable, clinician-patient conversation audio files are stored in HIPAA-secure disk/block storage based on appropriate data retention policies.
Security



DTLS-SRTP is used to ensure end-to-end security. Audio-video data is encrypted with AES 128-bit encryption. AES 128 key exchange happens over ECDHE_ECDSA with P-256 curve during DTLS handshake. Signaling happens over HTTPS/TLS 1.2 channel using RSA 2048-bit encryption.





7







Data Channel



A dedicated data channel is required to cover critical communication between the MDSs and clinicians. The channel is such that the conversation between the clinician and the MDS happens in a “room.” Each of the rooms work like a typical chat room with each shift comprising a session. The conversations usually include typical routine IMs, signals, switches to activate, deactivate or change state of certain components running in our Doc App and MDS Portal. The MDS Portal and Doc App both interact with the data channel over a secure network. The data channel consists of multiple nodes behind a Network Load Balancer (“NLB”) to ensure horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. Each of the nodes provides a full-duplex secure WebSocket connection to maintain a persistent connection with clients and uses Redis pub/sub mechanism to load balance users among different nodes.
Data



All web applications and our Doc App web services store data inside HIPAA-secure databases. The databases store administrative information relating to clinicians and MDSs. We temporarily store audio and text data on the HIPAA-secure servers to accommodate operational processes including training, quality assurance and production work. We store certain data for longer terms and maintain a database of de-identified data to train our AI models. We also maintain a database of meta-data based on Notebuilder selections. Such data is used to improve our products and provide enhanced services to our customers.
Scalability and Uptime



Our streaming servers with redundant capacity are placed in different availability zones to ensure fault tolerance. All the servers are located in the United States. All requests to streaming endpoints are load balanced and served in a round-robin approach. Using the proprietary Augmedix OTA portal, we can selectively push Android OS updates to specific devices. We use enterprise level device management software to maintain and manage our Phone devices. New features, improvements, bug fixes made to our MDS applications, can be released separately/independently to production servers through a planned and well-documented process.
Our Operations




Our Remotely Located Medical Documentation Specialists



Our services are supported by highly trained MDSs, who use Notebuilder and other technology tools to deliver clinically comprehensive medical notes into the customer’s EHR system. Our MDSs use dedicated secure terminals to access the Notebuilder application which serves as their workspace. They use Notebuilder to observe clinician-patient visit audio/video feeds, view the automatically generated NLP-annotated transcripts, and complete the medical note documentation. Completed medical notes are uploaded manually or automatically into the patient's chart in the EHR for clinician review and approval.



Our MDSs are well educated, most at the university level and many are recruited straight out of university. Many have Biology majors, but we also recruit from various other disciplines. We also recruit from a large, established pool of medical transcriptionists in India. The MDS position can be a very attractive alternative to medical transcription as that industry is contracting due to advancements in speech-to-text technology.



All of our MDSs must pass our mandatory intensive training program prior to working with our clinicians. Our proprietary training modules are trainer-led and include medical visit basics, visit videos, medical documentation standards and requirements, and practice sessions using Notebuilder and other tools. The training program for new MDSs takes approximately three months for international trainees to complete and includes strict testing and grade achievement standards. We also provide specialty training for several specialties. We support many specialties in clinic and hospital settings and are continuing to build our specialty training library.

Our Live service is provided during the clinician’s shift. Our MDSs serve as an extension of the care team and are assigned to clinicians based on specialty. Typically, one MDS will accompany a clinician for the duration of that clinician’s shift. As our Notebuilder technology advances, the time required to complete a medical note will decrease.



Our Notes service takes place after the patient visit. Clinician-patient interactions are recorded, and transcripts are processed after the visit. NLP is applied to the transcript and MDSs make edits within Notebuilder to compile the note. Completed notes are delivered before the clinician resumes his/her next shift. The task of creating a medical note from a recording is less challenging than doing so in real time. Moreover, and in particular with the benefit of Notebuilder, an MDS is able to handle the notes for more than one clinician during his/her shift.



Our Operation Centers



We provide service from nine MDS Operations Centers across four countries — the US, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. There are six centers in India and one center in Sri Lanka that are owned and operated by five independent third parties (the “MDS Vendors”), while the centers in the US and Bangladesh are wholly owned and operated by us. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of our worldwide MDSs are currently working from home in compliance with local regulations and safety protocols.



Our strategy is to diversify geographical risk by operating out of several operating centers located in various cities throughout Asia, with a smaller operation within the US. The US operation accounts for a small fraction of our global MDS workforce, and we expect that it won’t exceed 10% of the global total for the foreseeable future. Some of our US MDSs are hourly, while others are full-time.



Our Bangladesh operation is our largest and fastest growing center. It served about 37% of our customers as of December 31, 2021. We expect to have over 40% of our customers serviced out of Bangladesh by the end of 2022. This is to enable greater control over a larger percentage of our operations, to mitigate concentration risk among existing MDS Vendors and to leverage its lower cost structure.



All MDS Vendors are currently paid based upon an hourly rate and the number of assigned contracted clinician hours. This payment arrangement represents a substantial change from the previous model that operated through the first half of 2020 wherein MDS Vendors included additional upfront flat fees for each MDS passing our training and certification requirements. Under the current arrangement, effective for all MDS Vendors as of July 2020, the hourly rate paid to each Vendor reflects the amortized cost of training and certifications.



Our Bangladeshi MDSs, all of whom are employees, are paid a fixed monthly salary. In addition to MDSs, our Bangladesh offices include engineering, customer support, human resources, global information technology, compliance, finance and accounting and general management, among other personnel. All our Bangladesh-based employees receive complimentary benefits such as healthcare, and when working from our offices, meals and private transportation to their homes after certain hours, among others. We believe the compensation we provide our Bangladeshi employees is competitive in the local market for US-based employers.



Our Customers



Our customers are diverse in size, geography, and specialty. Our clients include some of the largest health systems and specialty groups in the United States, including Sutter Health, Dignity Health, US Oncology, TriHealth, Northern Light, Summit Pacific and UCSF, among others. Approximately 75% of the physicians we serve are members of large health systems, while the remaining 25% are from small independent practices or physician groups. We have a relatively high concentration of physicians served among our enterprise customers, with one client accounting for 18% of clinicians in service, another client accounting for 16%, and another client accounting for 12% while the remaining physicians served are spread across 13 other health systems. We generated revenue from customers in 41 different states in 2021, the largest concentration being in California. Within our customer base, we currently serve 35 specialties, the largest of which is primary care at 48% of total physicians served. Our systems are compatible with 50+ different EHRs. The top four account for 78% of all our physicians served, with Epic at 39%, Cerner at 29%, iKnowMed at 7%, and NextGen at 3%.

Areas of expansion within our existing enterprise customers include deeper penetration of the locations where we already serve physicians, coverage of new specialties, and entering new care locations. We define success with our clients according to two key criteria, increased productivity and physician satisfaction. With clients that follow our best practices framework and share data with us, we focus on time savings and productivity increases.



The primary drivers of a physician’s productivity are patient volume, the appropriate and completeness of the documentation describing the services rendered during the patient visit and the efficiency with which such services were performed. We believe that the aggregate increase in productivity across its physician base drives the health system’s overall financial performance and the ROI potential of our services.



Some examples of the value our users see is captured in the following case studies:



Case Study #1: Dr. Hengbing Wang



“Augmedix allows me to have more time communicating with patients, clinical staff and other physicians. The quality of care goes up with more communications.”



HIGHLIGHTS




● | Dr. Wang now sees at least 15% more patients 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Dr. Wang now has capacity to see urgent oncology referrals

ABOUT



Dr. Hengbing Wang is a clinician specializing in hematology and medical oncology at Cancer Treatment & Infusion Center, a part of Adventist Health in Ukiah, California. The center offers a wide range of cancer treatments, including the most advanced IV infusion therapies.
CHALLENGE



Dr. Wang, like many clinicians, spent so much time balancing direct patient care with administrative tasks that he was left with little time for charting. That meant working in the EMR was usually done during his personal time. Dr. Wang said, “It was kind of miserable. I often had to stay beyond 7:00pm and still had to do some charting at night and over the weekend.” He wanted to find a solution that would allow him to keep charting updated during office hours so he wouldn’t have to spend so much personal time catching up.
SOLUTION



Dr. Wang chose to partner with Augmedix for its virtual scribe service. Augmedix virtual scribes act as an always-present assistant to the clinician, converting real-time clinician-patient conversations into precise medical documentation. Augmedix virtual scribes are specially trained to work in both acute and non-acute environments and are experienced in most EMRs. Virtual scribes can also place orders for testing, medications, and labs so clinicians can spend more time on direct patient care. Clinicians can livestream with their virtual scribes via Google Glass technology or an encrypted smartphone provided by Augmedix.
RESULTS



Dr. Wang says Augmedix has made a “drastic Improvement” in work-life balance. “I hardly do any charting after I get home or on the weekend now.” He says that most of the time, he’s able to finish everything by 6:00pm. “I am able to enjoy more of my family life!” With Augmedix, Dr. Wang is able to see at least 15% more patients and now has capacity to see urgent oncology referrals.



Dr. Wang says the consultation note part saves him most of the time. “Literally, when I review the records before I see the patient, I can read to my scribe and they’re often able to compile a basic history of present illness (“HPI”) even before I step in the patient room.” Dr. Wang also says that he and his Augmedix scribe have developed great working chemistry.

Case Study #2: Dr. Jacqueline Rohrer



“Prior to Augmedix, my whole family would ask ‘how many charts do you have left,’ and the whole weekend was plagued by the number of charts left. With Augmedix, I feel like I found the way to be happy with my job and I want to share this experience with other clinicians.”
HIGHLIGHTS: 




● | Has more time to spend with patients;
--+--------------------------------------


● | Can see more walk-ins; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Went from seeing 18 patients a day to 20; 
● | Charting is more accurate; 
● | Has more time for family life; 
● | Improved productivity; and 
● | Scribes now help with telephone referrals and reminders.

ABOUT



Jacqueline Rohrer, MD, is a family practice physician who specializes in obstetrics at Foothill Family Clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah. She’s been with the practice since 2013. The practice has 35 providers, clinicians, and mid-level practitioners.
CHALLENGE



Rohrer loves her patients and is dedicated to spending quality time with each one. Her days are spent juggling her family practice patients with her obstetrics patients. She had begun to experience extreme burnout and even wondered if she would need to stop practicing obstetrics. She realized a lot of the issue came from the two to three hours she had to spend at the end of each day on charting. On busy weeks, the charts would really pile up. She often would get to the end of each week with a backlog of three days’ worth of charts to do. Someone had suggested to Rohrer that she get a scribe to help out, but she resisted doing so because she didn’t want a “shadow” following her around all day and didn’t like the loss of patient privacy. Plus, the exam rooms were small and didn’t have desks or a place for anything more than a laptop, which she carried with her. Fortunately, she realized there was a better solution.
SOLUTION



Rohrer heard about Augmedix virtual scribes on a Facebook group for moms who are doctors. Augmedix virtual scribes are specially trained to work in both acute and non-acute environments, acting as an always-present assistant to the provider, converting real-time provider-patient conversations into precise medical documentation. Augmedix virtual scribes are experienced in most medical health records, which improves accuracy, increases quality of documentation, and ensures timely charge capture for faster reimbursement. Virtual scribes can also place orders for testing, medications, and labs so providers can spend more time on direct patient care. Providers can connect with their virtual scribes via Google Glass technology, an earpiece, or through a smartphone app. Rohrer chose to use Google Glasses with her virtual scribes because of the ability to move about the clinic handsfree without having to carry a smartphone.

RESULTS



Rohrer likes the seamless communication with her virtual scribes through Google Glass technology. Because she’s a self-described “people person,” she wanted to get to know her Augmedix scribes on a personal level, so she connected with them over social media. They now regularly check in and chat with each other. Rohrer has experienced many improvements since getting her Augmedix virtual scribes, including:

● | Has more time to spend with patients;
--+--------------------------------------


● | Can see more walk-ins; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Went from seeing 18 patients a day to 20; 
● | Charting is more accurate; 
● | Has more time for family life; 
● | Improved productivity; and 
● | Scribes now help with telephone referrals and reminders.




The time saved using Augmedix has allowed Rohrer to complete two triathlons and even adopt a baby. She says she no longer feels burnt out and now looks forward to each day. With Augmedix, Rohrer went from spending 2 – 3 hours charting at the end of each day to just 30 to 45 minutes.



Governmental Regulation



The healthcare industry in which we operate is highly regulated, and the services we provide are subject to a complex set of healthcare laws and regulations. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements, including among others, HIPAA, HITECH, regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a number of fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, and comparable state laws. We have structured our operations to comply with these laws and other regulatory and contractual requirements.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws



We may also be subject to various federal laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.



For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly or willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been broadly interpreted by federal courts and agencies, and potentially subject many healthcare business arrangements to government investigation, enforcement, and prosecution, which can be costly and time consuming. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.



In addition, the False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, we could be held liable under the False Claims Act if we are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, including inaccurate information in draft medical notes for physicians, or if our documentation services are found to have caused clinicians to have inaccurately attested to “Meaningful Use” criteria. Claims for services that were induced by kickbacks and in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also form the basis for FCA liability. In recent years, many cases have been brought against healthcare companies by the government and by “whistleblowers,” which have resulted in judgments and settlements involving substantial payments to the government by the companies involved. Often, to avoid the threat of treble damages and penalties under the False Claims Act, which in 2021 were $11,803 to $23,607 per false claim, companies will resolve allegations in a settlement without admitting liability to avoid the potential treble damages. Any such settlement or the cost to defend against allegations could be substantial and impact our reputation.





12







HIPAA also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.



Additionally, many of the states in which we operate also have similar fraud and abuse focused laws that apply to our business. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.



Violations of these laws are punishable by substantial penalties and other remedies, including monetary fines, civil penalties, administrative penalties, criminal sanctions (in the case of Anti-Kickback Statute), exclusion from participation in FHCPs, forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws and additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations. Similarly state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only government programs.



Data Privacy and Security



Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information, privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners.



For example, HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of protected health information (“PHI”). Under HIPAA, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, together referred to as “covered entities” for purposes of HIPAA, and their “business associates” must protect individually identifiable health information in accordance with certain standards. HITECH enhances and strengthens the HIPAA privacy and security standards and makes certain provisions of HIPAA directly applicable to business associates of covered entities.



In connection with our business operations, we access, use and disclose PHI on behalf of our covered entity and business associate clients, and therefore, are considered to be, a business associate of our customers and subject to HIPAA, and its implementing regulations. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, such as us, to have agreements with their business associates, pursuant to which business associates must agree to appropriately safeguard the PHI created or received on their behalf and to abide by statutory and other regulatory obligations under HIPAA. These obligations include, but are not limited to, the responsibility to (i) maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI, (ii) report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of PHI, including to individuals and governmental authorities, (iii) assist covered entities or business associates from which we obtain health information with certain duties under HIPAA; and (iv) enter into business associate agreements with our downstream contractors that access, use, and disclose the PHI we receive, create, and maintain, on behalf of our covered entity or business associate customers.





13







HIPAA and HITECH impose numerous requirements on our business operations, and subject us to material liability and other adverse impacts to our business in the event we fail to comply with their requirements. These include, without limitation, civil fines, possible criminal sanctions in certain circumstances, contractual liability to our customers, and damage to our brand and reputation. We have implemented appropriate safeguards to address the privacy and security of PHI consistent with our regulatory and contractual requirements. We also train our personnel regarding HIPAA and other related requirements. We have made and continue to make investments in systems to support customer operations that are regulated by HIPAA and other regulations. Because these standards are subject to interpretation and change, we cannot predict the future impact of HIPAA or other regulations on our business and operations. To comply with our regulatory and contractual obligations, we may have to adjust our policies and practices and invest in new technologies.



In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information. In many cases, state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and may impose more stringent standards, thus complicating compliance efforts.



Other Laws and Regulations



We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
Sales and Marketing



Currently, we predominantly rely upon a dedicated direct sales force and account management team to sell our solutions. The direct sales force is currently structured geographically and focuses on acquiring new health systems, large physician specialty practices and generating transactional sales with smaller practices and independent physicians. Our sales force mobilizes data to demonstrate a clear ROI for investing in our solution to potential customers. There is typically a 30-45 day implementation window from contract execution to first day of service to allow for provision of hardware, clinician workflow orientation, MDS assignment and receipt of EHR credentials.



Additional sales activity is driven by our account management team. The account management team is responsible for expansion within our existing client base. The team is currently structured by account segment: strategic enterprises, developing enterprises, and physician practices.



Our marketing efforts focus on lead generation, building market awareness and content support. Marketing drives market/brand awareness and inbound leads from both enterprises and physician practices. Our team tracks the effectiveness of specific marketing campaigns to ensure their efficacy against our established cost-per-lead and customer acquisition cost targets. A variety of marketing approaches are leveraged including search engine optimization, paid search advertising, social media campaigns, social media advertising, email marketing, and attending conferences. We also focus on end-to-end marketing campaigns to drive leads and awareness, such as our 2020 launch of Notes.



In 2021 we signed a few channel partnership deals with various groups, some of which have members who are clinicians. In general, these partnerships provide us with warm leads for a fee if we convert them into signed contracts.

Research & Development



Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (“AI/ML”) 



We have integrated AI/ML into Notebuilder to increase efficiency by automatically providing note suggestions from the transcripts of recordings. This requires training AI/ML models to provide note suggestions based on key words from audio transcripts and audio-to-note patterns. We store audio and note records used in this process only if agreed to by the customer. We use speech-to-text tools, enhanced by our own adaptations, to produce multi-party transcripts for the persisted audios of selected doctor/patient visits. This is followed by an annotation process to assign labels to transcripts and the corresponding notes. The labels that come from the annotation step are used to develop classification models. The final stage is to apply one of several NLP methods to generate note suggestions which are then integrated into Notebuilder to further reduce the amount of human intervention needed to create a medical note. These models are being continuously improved.
Streaming Technologies



We are continuously improving our streaming platform, primarily to alleviate network hiccups, optimize audio quality for transcription and improve the clinician user experience. The goal is to improve the reliability and scalability of the Platform while reducing costs.
Devices for Providers



We continue to explore alternate hardware devices that can be used by clinicians. In addition to ease of use, improved audio quality, better connectivity and faster battery charge rate are some of the criteria used in our evaluation process.
Electronic Health Records (“EHRs”)



An EHR is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care. EHRs are a vital part of health IT and can:

● | Contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Allow access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make decisions about a patient’s care
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automate and streamline provider workflow
--+------------------------------------------




Health information can be created and managed by authorized providers in a digital format capable of being shared with other providers across more than one healthcare organization. EHRs are built to share information with other healthcare providers and organizations — such as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinics. EHR systems are selected by our customers either as independent physicians, clinics or health systems.



Currently, we do most of our note transfers manually. In 2021, we developed direct integration with the athena health EHR system and connected several of our customers. We are developing technology to direct-integrate our software tools into the other EHR systems used by our large enterprise customers. For our smaller customers we expect to continue to transfer notes to the EHR manually. As we scale within an enterprise health system, EHR integration improves note quality and enhances our operating efficiency. EHR integration will also help inform our machine learning models, thus increasing automation levels associated with note documentation.



Transferring notes to an EHR requires secure access to the customer’s EHR which they must authorize to receive the service. We support various types of virtual private network (“VPN”) access to an EHR, such as site-to-site VPN tunnels, VPN client software, and browser-based VPN plugins like Citrix.

Intellectual Property



Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, as well as other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.



We have been building and continue to build our patent portfolio relating to our technology platform. As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio consists of three pending patent applications in the United States. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.



In addition to patents, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and processes, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships.



We have filed for and obtained trademark protection in the United States for the AUGMEDIX word mark and AUGMEDIX CROSS logo for goods and services. We have also filed for trademark protection in India of the AUGMEDIX word mark for goods and services. We also have registered the domain name for our website, www.augmedix.com.



We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.



Corporate Information



We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as Malo Holdings Corporation on December 27, 2018. On October 5, 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary August Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Acquisition Sub”), merged with and into Augmedix, a Delaware corporation (“Private Augmedix”) formed on April 30, 2013 (the “Merger”). Following the Merger, Private Augmedix was the surviving entity and became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and all of the outstanding shares of common and preferred stock of Augmedix were converted into shares of our common stock. The business of Private Augmedix became our business as a result of the Merger. On October 5, 2020, our board of directors and all of our pre-Merger stockholders approved a restated certificate of incorporation, which was effective upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 5, 2020 and through which we changed our name to “Augmedix, Inc.”



Our common stock is currently listed and traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). We announced our listing on Nasdaq on October 26, 2021.



Our principal executive offices are located at 111 Sutter Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco, CA 94104. Our telephone number is (888) 669-4885. Our website address is www.augmedix.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of this Report.



Employees and Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 183 full-time and part-time employees in the United States, 2 full-time employees in India, and 521 full-time employees in Bangladesh. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.

Facilities



Our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, where we lease approximately 12,936 square feet of office space under a lease agreement that expires in February 2025. We also lease 23,578 square feet of corporate office space in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and an additional 3,800 square feet of commercial space used for MDS training in an adjacent facility under a lease agreement which automatically renews quarterly unless notice is provided to terminate.



We believe our facilities meet our needs currently. We intend, however, to expand our facilities or add additional facilities in Dhaka, because we will reach the capacity of our existing facilities as our full workforce returns to the office, which we expect to happen at some point in 2022. We have identified suitable alternatives and/or additional space in Dhaka that will accommodate our needs but have not yet leased additional space. We believe these facilities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future.



Legal Proceedings



We are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
