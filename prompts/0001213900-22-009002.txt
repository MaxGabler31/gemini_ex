ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 10, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business transaction with one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”).



While we may pursue a Business Combination in any region or sector, we intend to focus our efforts on businesses in North America within the hospitality, leisure, travel and dining sectors with an emphasis on consumer branded businesses that have attractive growth characteristics. In addition, we intend to pursue technology companies operating in these sectors, such as business and consumer services and infrastructure. However, we do not intend to invest in businesses with large exposure to investments in physical real estate. We intend to focus on established and high-growth businesses that have an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $2.0 billion and would benefit from access to public markets and the operational and strategic expertise of our management team and board of directors. We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience of our management team in consummating a Business Combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive returns for our stockholders.



The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a Business Combination:




● | may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if we issue preferred shares with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock; 
● | will likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely will also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and 
● | may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities. 




Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in:




● | default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a Business Combination are insufficient to pay our debt obligations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and we breach any such covenant without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
● | our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and 
● | our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding. 




We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.



Proposed Business Combination



On November 10, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger by and among the Company, Ventoux Merger Sub I Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Ventoux Merger Sub”), Ventoux Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Ventoux Merger Sub II”), and E La Carte, Inc., d/b/a Presto, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Presto”) (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement has been approved by the Company’s and Presto’s board of directors. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by Presto and the Company’s stockholders, (a) Ventoux Merger Sub will merge with and into Presto (the “First Merger”), with Presto being the surviving entity in the First Merger and continuing (immediately following the First Merger) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Surviving Corporation”), and (b) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Ventoux Merger Sub II (the “Second Merger”), with Ventoux Merger Sub II being the surviving entity in the Second Merger and continuing (immediately following the Second Merger) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Mergers” and the other agreements and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Proposed Business Combination”). In addition, in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination, the Company will be renamed Presto Technologies, Inc. and is referred to herein as “New Presto” as of the time of such change of name.





1







Merger Consideration



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the Proposed Business Combination (the “Closing”), the Company will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Presto, and stockholders of Presto will receive $800,000,000 in aggregate consideration (the “Aggregate Base Consideration”) in the form of newly issued common stock in New Presto, calculated based on a price of $10.00 per share.



In addition to the Aggregate Base Consideration, Presto stockholders may be entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company, Ventoux Merger Sub, Ventoux Merger Sub II or the Company’s stockholders, 15,000,000 additional shares of common stock of New Presto (the “Presto Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows: (A) 7,500,000 Presto Earnout Shares, if, during the period from and after the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing, the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP” as defined in the Merger Agreement) of New Presto common stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, and (B) an additional 7,500,000 Presto Earnout Shares, if, during the period from and after the Closing until the fifth anniversary of the Closing, the VWAP of New Presto common stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days.



Equity Awards, Presto Convertible Notes and Warrants



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the time the First Merger becomes effective (the “Effective Time”), each option exercisable for Presto equity that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and converted into a newly issued option exercisable for common stock of New Presto. At the Effective Time, each warrant of Presto that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in accordance with its terms, either be (i) cancelled and converted into the right to receive common stock of New Presto, or (ii) assumed and converted into a newly issued warrant exercisable for common stock of New Presto. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each convertible promissory note convertible for Presto equity that is issued and outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive common stock of New Presto in accordance with the terms therein.  
Subscription Agreements



The Company entered into equity subscription agreements (the “Equity Subscription Agreements”) each dated as of November 10, 2021, with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with the Closing, an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of common stock for $10.00 per share. The Equity Subscription Agreements provide that the Company must file a registration statement to register the resale of the subscribed common stock no later than 30 days after the closing date of the Proposed Business Combination (the “Closing Date”).



The Company also entered into a convertible note subscription agreement (the “Convertible Note Subscription Agreement” and, together with the Equity Subscription Agreements, the “Subscription Agreements”), each dated as of November 10, 2021, with an institutional accredited investor (collectively, the “Note Investor”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement to close immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of $55,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the “Notes”) and an aggregate of 1,000,000 warrants (the “Note Financing Warrants”).



At any time prior to the close of business on the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes, the Notes will be convertible, at each holder’s option, into shares of common stock of New Presto at an initial conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) $13.00 and (ii) a 30% premium to the lowest per share price at which any equity of the Company is issued within 15 days prior to the Closing Date (the “Conversion Rate”). In the event of a conversion in connection with a Fundamental Change (as defined below), the Conversion Rate will be increased by a number of additional shares set forth in a usual and customary “make-whole table” to be included in the indenture governing the Notes (the “Indenture”).



At any time on or after the first anniversary of the issuance of the Notes until the second business day prior to maturity, the Notes will be convertible, in whole but not in part, at the Company’s option (a “Mandatory Conversion”) if the closing price of common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the Notes for 20 trading days during any 30-consecutive-trading-day period ending on day before the notice of the Mandatory Conversion is given. The Conversion Rate in connection with a Mandatory Conversion will be increased by a number of additional shares pursuant to the make-whole table described above.

In addition, the Company may redeem the Notes at any time prior to the 21st trading day before maturity by paying, in cash, the principal, accrued interest, and a premium equal to, (1) through third anniversary, the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments, computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (to be defined in the Indenture) plus 0.50%, and warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to 50% of the number of shares into which the Notes redeemed were convertible, or (2) between third anniversary and maturity, of all remaining scheduled interest payments, computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate.



Each holder of a Note will have the right to cause the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of the Notes held by such holder at any time upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the repurchase date.



The Company will pay interest on the principal amount of the Notes in cash or in kind, at the Company’s election. If the Company elects to pay interest in cash (“Cash Interest”), the interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 9.0% per annum and be payable in cash. If the Company elects to pay interest in kind (“PIK Interest”), the interest on the Notes will be increased to a rate of 11.0% per annum. PIK Interest will be payable either (x) by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes by an amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest $1.00) or (y) if the Notes are no longer held as global notes, by issuing additional Notes in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the period (rounded up to the nearest $1.00). Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Notes as a result of a PIK Interest payment, the Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount.



The Note Financing Warrants have the same terms and conditions as the Company’s outstanding publicly held warrants, except that each Note Financing Warrant is exercisable into one whole share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Note Financing Warrants, like the publicly held warrants, may be redeemed if, among other conditions, the reported last sale price of the Company common stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share, for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on the third business day prior to the date of the notice of redemption to warrantholders.



A “Fundamental Change” will be deemed to have occurred under the terms of our Notes at the time after the Notes are originally issued if any of the following occurs:



(a) a “person” or “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than us, our wholly owned subsidiaries and our and their employee benefit plans, has become the direct or indirect “beneficial owner,” as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of our common equity representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common equity and has filed a Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report) or any schedule, form or report under the Exchange Act that discloses such fact, unless such beneficial ownership arises solely as a result of a revocable proxy delivered in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act and is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G (or any successor schedule) under the Exchange Act; provided that no person or group shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf of such person or group until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase or exchange under such offer;



(b) the consummation of (A) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of our Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a subdivision or combination) as a result of which our Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or assets; (B) any share exchange, consolidation or merger of us pursuant to which our common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets; or (C) any sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person other than one of our wholly owned subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither (i) a transaction described in clause (A) or clause (B) in which the holders of all classes of our Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of all classes of Common Stock of the continuing or surviving corporation or transferee or the direct or indirect parent thereof immediately after such transaction in substantially the same proportions (relative to each other) as such ownership immediately prior to such transaction nor (ii) any merger of the Company solely for the purpose of change its jurisdiction of incorporation that results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of common stock of the surviving entity shall, in each case, be a Fundamental Change pursuant to this clause (b);



(c) our stockholders approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of us; or



(d) our Common Stock ceases to be listed or quoted on any of The New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market, and is not listed or quote on either such exchange one trading day following such event.



A transaction or transactions described in clause (a) or clause (b) above will not constitute a fundamental change, however, if at least 90% of the consideration received or to be received by our common stockholders, excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters' appraisal rights, in connection with such transaction or transactions consists of shares of common stock that are listed or quoted on any of The New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market or will be so listed or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction or transactions and as a result of such transaction or transactions the Notes become convertible into such consideration, excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters' appraisal rights.

Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement



At the Closing, New Presto, the Sponsors and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, will enter into an amended and restated warrant agreement (the “Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement”) to reflect the issuance of the Note Financing Warrants. In addition, the Amended and Restated Warrant Agreement also provides that 600,000 of the Sponsors’ 6,675,000 private placement warrants will be cancelled. Each Note Financing Warrant and each private placement warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement



At the Closing, New Presto, the Sponsors, the Note Investor, certain investors and other holders of Presto capital stock (the “Presto Holders” and together with the Sponsors and the investors, the “Holders”) will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the “Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, New Presto will be obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of certain securities of New Presto held by the Holders. The Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement also provides the Holders with certain “demand” and “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions.
Sponsor Support Agreement



In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsors, Presto’s directors and officers and certain affiliates of the Sponsors (together, the “Sponsor Parties”) entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Agreement”) with the Company and Presto, pursuant to which the Sponsor Parties agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of the Company common stock beneficially owned by them in favor of each of the proposals at the Company Special Meeting and against any proposal that would impede the Proposed Business Combination. The Sponsor Agreement also provides that the Sponsor Parties will not redeem any shares of the Company common stock.



The Sponsor Parties agreed to subject the founder shares they acquired prior to the Company’s initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) to lock-up restrictions. During the period beginning on the Closing Date until the period beginning on the Closing Date to six months after the Closing Date, the Sponsor Parties may not transfer any of its, his or her founder shares, and during the period beginning on the date that is six months after the Closing Date to 12 twelve months after the Closing Date, the Sponsor Parties may only transfer up to 50% of its, his or her founder shares, in each case except for certain limited permitted transfers. In addition, the Sponsor Parties agreed that they will not transfer any privately placed warrants, acquired prior to the Initial Public Offering, during the period from the Closing Date to 12 months after the Closing Date.



The Sponsors also agreed to subject their founder shares to vesting and forfeiture provisions as set forth in the Sponsor Agreement based on the number of public shares redeemed at the closing of the Proposed Business Combination (such shares, the “Sponsors’ Earnout Shares”). Pursuant to the Sponsor Agreement, at the Closing, (i) in the case of redemptions of public shares of 90% or more, 15% of the Sponsors’ founder shares that are owned immediately after the Closing will be subject to vesting, (ii) in the case of redemptions of public shares of between 80% and 90%, 10% of the Sponsors’ founder shares that are owned immediately after the Closing will be subject to vesting, (iii) in the case of redemptions of public shares of between 70% and 80%, 5% of the Sponsors’ founder shares that are owned immediately after the Closing will be subject to vesting and (iv) in the case of redemptions of public shares of less than 70%, none of the Sponsors’ founder shares will be subject to vesting. The Sponsors’ Earnout Shares will vest if, during the period from and after the Closing until the fifth anniversary of the Closing, the VWAP of New Presto common stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 40 trading days within a period of 60 consecutive trading days.



Presto Stockholder Support Agreement



 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of Presto (collectively, the “Presto Supporting Stockholders”) entered into support agreements (collectively, the “Stockholder Support Agreements”), pursuant to which each Presto Supporting Stockholder agreed to, among other things, vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Proposed Business Combination), not to transfer his, her or its Presto shares prior to the Closing Date, and to execute the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) at the Closing Date.



The Presto Stockholder Support Agreements provide that during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is six months after the Closing Date, the Presto Supporting Stockholders may not transfer any of their shares of New Presto common stock, and during the period beginning on the date that is six months after the Closing Date and ending on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date, the Presto Supporting Stockholders may only transfer up to 50% of their New Presto common stock, in each case, except for certain limited permitted transfers.

Governance Agreement



At the Closing, New Presto, Rajat Suri, REMUS Capital, an affiliate of Presto, and certain other parties set forth therein, will enter into a Governance Agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) to provide for certain governance rights and address certain governance matters relating to New Presto. The Governance Agreement will provide REMUS Capital the right to designate a replacement New Presto director if a director appointed within class I of the board is removed within one year of Closing and also will provide each of Mr. Suri and REMUS Capital with the right to nominate one individual to the New Presto board of directors, subject to certain qualifications, requirements and exceptions as set forth therein.



The Proposed Business Combination is expected to be consummated after receipt of the required approvals by the stockholders of the Company and Presto and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary conditions. For full details and the filed agreements, refer to our Current Report on 8-K announcing the Merger Agreement filed on November 10, 2021.



No Offer or Solicitation



This Annual Report on Form 10-K is not intended to and shall not constitute a proxy statement or the solicitation of a proxy, consent or authorization with respect to any securities in respect of the Proposed Business Combination and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe for any securities or a solicitation of any vote of approval, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination.
Facilities



Our office space is located at 1 East Putnam Avenue, Floor 4, Greenwich, CT 06830. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.



Employees



We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information



We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.





5







Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the , (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
