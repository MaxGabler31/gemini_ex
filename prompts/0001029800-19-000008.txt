 Item 1. Business.
 
Organization
 
We are a real estate investment trust, organized as a Maryland corporation, engaged in the acquisition, ownership and management of commercial real estate. We were organized as an unincorporated business trust (the “Trust”) under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on July 7, 1969. In 1997, the shareholders of the Trust approved a plan of reorganization of the Trust from a Massachusetts business trust to a Maryland corporation.  As a result of the plan of reorganization, the Trust was merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of the Trust ceased, the Company was the surviving entity in the merger and each issued and outstanding common share of beneficial interest of the Trust was converted into one share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company.
Tax Status – Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust
 
We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), beginning with our taxable year ended October 31, 1970.  Pursuant to such provisions of the Code, a REIT that distributes at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and meets certain other conditions regarding the nature of its income and assets will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders.  Although we believe that we qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, no assurance can be given that we will continue to qualify as a REIT.
Description of Business
 
Our business is the ownership of real estate investments, which consist principally of investments in income-producing properties, with primary emphasis on neighborhood and community shopping centers in the metropolitan New York tri-state area outside of the City of New York.  We believe that our geographic focus allows us to take advantage of the strong demographic profiles of the areas that surround the City of New York and the natural barriers to entry that such density and limitations on developable land provide.  We also believe that our ability to directly operate and manage all of our properties within the tri-state area reduces overhead costs and affords us efficiencies that a more dispersed portfolio would make difficult.
 
At October 31, 2018, the Company owned or had equity interests in 84 properties comprised of neighborhood and community shopping centers, office buildings, single tenant retail or restaurant properties and office/retail mixed use properties located in four states, containing a total of 5.1 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”).  We seek to identify desirable properties, typically neighborhood and community shopping centers, for acquisition, which we acquire in the normal course of business.  In addition, we regularly review our portfolio and, from time to time, may sell certain of our properties.  For a description of the Company's properties and information about the carrying amount of the properties at October 31, 2018 and encumbrances, see Item 2. Properties and Schedule III located in Item 15.
 
We do not consider our real estate business to be seasonal in nature.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our long-term growth strategy is to increase cash flow, and consequently the value of our properties, through strategic re-leasing, renovations and expansions of our existing properties and selective acquisitions of income-producing properties, primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers, in our targeted geographic region.  We may also invest in other types of real estate in our targeted geographic region. Key elements of our growth strategy and operating objectives are to:

• | acquire quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the United States with a concentration on properties in the metropolitan New York tri-state area outside of the City of New York, and unlock further value in these properties with selective enhancements to both the property and tenant mix, as well as improvements to management and leasing fundamentals; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selectively dispose of underperforming properties and re-deploy the proceeds into potentially higher performing properties that meet our acquisition criteria; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | invest in our properties for the long-term through regular maintenance, periodic renovations and capital improvements, enhancing their attractiveness to tenants and customers, as well as increasing their value; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leverage opportunities to increase GLA at existing properties, through development of pad sites and reconfiguring of existing square footage, to meet the needs of existing or new tenants; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proactively manage our leasing strategy by aggressively marketing available GLA, renewing existing leases with strong tenants, and replacing weak ones when necessary, with an eye towards securing leases that include regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents, replacing below-market-rent leases with increased market rents when possible and further improving the quality of our tenant mix at our shopping centers; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain strong working relationships with our tenants, particularly our anchor tenants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain a conservative capital structure with low leverage levels, ample liquidity and diverse sources of capital; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | control property operating and administrative costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------



Our hope is to grow our assets through acquisitions by 5% to 10% per year on a dollar value basis, subject to the availability of acquisitions that meet our investment parameters, although we cannot guarantee that investment properties meeting our investment specifications will be available to us.
 
Renovations, Expansions and Improvements
 
We invest in properties where cost effective renovation and expansion programs, combined with effective leasing and operating strategies, can improve the properties’ values and economic returns.  Retail properties are typically adaptable for varied tenant layouts and can be reconfigured to accommodate new tenants or the changing space needs of existing tenants.  We also seek to leverage existing shopping center assets through pad site development.  In determining whether to proceed with a renovation, expansion or pad, we consider both the cost of such expansion or renovation and the increase in rent attributable to such expansion or renovation.  We believe that certain of our properties provide opportunities for future renovation and expansion.  We generally do not engage in ground-up development projects.
 
We also seek to improve our properties in ways that provide additional ancillary revenue or value, while benefiting the environment and communities in which we have a presence.  For example, we have a robust alternative energy program, pursuant to which we have placed a number of solar panel installations on the roofs of our shopping centers.  We are also in the process of installing electric vehicle charging stations at a number of our properties, which we believe will not only benefit the environment but enhance customer experience at our shopping centers.  Other initiatives include converting incandescent and florescent lighting to LED at various properties and upgrading parking lot lighting systems to operate more efficiently.  While we are committed to environmental responsibility, we also believe that these initiatives need to be financially feasible and beneficial to the Company, which may require that these projects be completed over a period of time.  The Company will continue to seek financially responsible opportunities to reduce our carbon footprint and lower our energy usage, while improving the value of our properties.
 
Acquisitions and Dispositions
 
When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider such factors as (i) economic, demographic, and regulatory conditions in the property’s local and regional market; (ii) the location, construction quality, and design of the property; (iii) the current and projected cash flow of the property and the potential to increase cash flow; (iv) the potential for capital appreciation of the property; (v) the terms of tenant leases, including the relationship between the property’s current rents and market rents and the ability to increase rents upon lease rollover; (vi) the occupancy and demand by tenants for properties of a similar type in the market area; (vii) the potential to complete a strategic renovation, expansion or re-tenanting of the property; (viii) the property’s current expense structure and the potential to increase operating margins; (ix) competition from comparable properties in the market area; and (x) vulnerability of the property's tenants to competition from e-commerce.
 
We may, from time to time, enter into arrangements for the acquisition of properties with property owners through the issuance of non-managing member units or partnership units in these joint venture entities that we control, which we refer to as our DownREIT entities. The limited partners and non-managing members of each of these joint ventures are entitled to receive annual or quarterly cash distributions payable from available cash of the joint venture.  The limited partners and non-managing members of these joint ventures have the right to require the Company to repurchase or redeem all or a portion of their limited partner or non-managing member interests for cash or Class A Common Stock of the Company, at our election, at prices and on terms set forth in the partnership or operating agreements.  We also have the right to redeem all or a portion of the limited partner and non-managing member interests for cash or Class A Common Stock of the Company, at our election, under certain circumstances, at prices and on terms set forth in the partnership or operating agreements.   We believe that this acquisition method may permit us to acquire properties from property owners wishing to enter into tax-deferred transactions.
 
From time to time, we selectively dispose of underperforming properties and re-deploy the proceeds into potentially higher performing properties that meet our acquisition critria.

Leasing Results
 
At October 31, 2018, our properties collectively had 987 leases with tenants providing a wide range of products and services.  Tenants include regional supermarkets, national and regional discount department stores, other local retailers and office tenants.  In addition, at our Yorktown, NY property, we have developed a portion of below grade space to a storage facility which currently has 510 storage tenants.  At October 31, 2018 the 77 consolidated properties were 93.2% leased and 91.7% occupied (see Results of Operations discussion in Item 7).  At October 31, 2018, we had equity investments in seven properties which we do not consolidate; those properties were 96.3% leased.  We believe the properties are adequately covered by property and liability insurance.
 
A substantial portion of our operating lease income is derived from tenants under leases with terms greater than one year.  Most of the leases provide for the payment of monthly fixed base rentals and for the payment by the tenant of a pro-rata share of the real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the properties.
 
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, no single tenant comprised more than 7.9% of the total annual base rents of our properties. The following table sets forth a schedule of our ten largest tenants by percent of total annual base rent of our properties to total annual base rent for the year ended October 31, 2018.
 

Tenant | Number of Stores | | % of Total Annual Base Rent of Properties
-------------------+------------------+----+------------------------------------------
Stop & Shop | | 8 | | 7.9 | %

    See Item 2. Properties for a complete list of the Company’s properties.
 
The Company’s single largest real estate investment is its 100% ownership of the general and limited partnership interests in the Ridgeway Shopping Center (“Ridgeway”).
 
Ridgeway is located in Stamford, Connecticut and was developed in the 1950s and redeveloped in the mid-1990s. The property contains approximately 374,000 square feet of GLA.  It is the dominant grocery-anchored center and the largest non-mall shopping center located in the City of Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut. For the year ended October 31, 2018, Ridgeway revenues represented approximately 10.4% of the Company’s total revenues and its assets represented approximately 7.0% of the Company’s total assets at October 31, 2018. As of October 31, 2018, Ridgeway was 96% leased. The property’s largest tenants (by base rent) are:  The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company (20%), Bed, Bath & Beyond (14%) and Marshall’s Inc., a division of the TJX Companies (10%).  No other tenant accounts for more than 10% of Ridgeway’s annual base rents.
 
The following table sets forth a schedule of the annual lease expirations for retail leases at Ridgeway as of October 31, 2018 for each of the next ten years and thereafter (assuming that no tenants exercise renewal or cancellation options and that there are no tenant bankruptcies or other tenant defaults):

Financing Strategy
 
We intend to continue to finance acquisitions and property improvements and/or expansions with the most advantageous sources of capital which we believe are available to us at the time, and which may include the sale of common or preferred equity through public offerings or private placements, the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings, investments in real estate joint ventures and the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets.  Our financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by (i) maintaining a prudent level of leverage, and (ii) minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk represented by floating rate debt.
Compliance with Governmental Regulations
 
We, like others in the commercial real estate industry, are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  We may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under our properties, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property).  These laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of those substances.  This liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of, or tenant at, the property.  The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets.  In addition, the presence of those substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral, which, in turn, would reduce our revenues and ability to make distributions.
 
Our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  The requirements of this Act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. Future compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar regulations may require expensive changes to the properties.
 
Competition
 
The real estate investment business is highly competitive.  We compete for real estate investments with investors of all types, including domestic and foreign corporations, financial institutions, other real estate investment trusts, real estate funds, individuals and privately owned companies.  In addition, our properties are subject to local competition from the surrounding areas.  Our shopping centers compete for tenants with other regional, community or neighborhood shopping centers in the respective areas where our retail properties are located.  In addition, the retail industry is seeing greater competition from internet retailers who may not need to establish “brick and mortar” retail locations for their businesses. This reduces the demand for traditional retail space in shopping centers like ours and other grocery-anchored shopping center properties.  Our office buildings compete for tenants principally with office buildings throughout the respective areas in which they are located.  Leasing decisions are generally determined by prospective tenants on the basis of, among other things, rental rates, location, and the physical quality of the property and availability of space.
Property Management
 
We actively manage and supervise the operations and leasing of all of our properties.
 
Employees
 
Our executive offices are located at 321 Railroad Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut.  Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. has 53 employees, all located at the Company’s executive offices.  Subsidiaries of the Company also employ an additional 16 full-time and part-time employees at other locations and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Company Website
 
All of the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge at the Company’s website at www.ubproperties.com as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.
