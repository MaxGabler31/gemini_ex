Company History
 
Helix TCS, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on March 13, 2014. Pursuant to the acquisition of the assets of Helix TCS, LLC, as discussed below, we changed our name from Jubilee4 Gold, Inc. to Helix TCS, Inc. effective October 25, 2015.
 
Effective October 25, 2015, we entered into an acquisition and exchange agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Helix TCS LLC (the “LLC”). We closed the transaction contemplated under the Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition”) on December 23, 2015 and Helix TCS, LLC was merged into and with Helix.
 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Agreement, the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding units of the LLC immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, exchanged their units for an aggregate of 22,225,000 shares of our common stock (post-reverse split) and all of our issued Class A Preferred Stock.
 
Effective April 11, 2016, we acquired the assets of Revolutionary Software, LLC (“Revolutionary”). The acquisition occurred through two transactions, the first occurred on March 14, 2016 and the second occurred on April 11, 2016. The total consideration for the acquisition included payment in the form of $650,000 in cash and 2,395,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company. A portion of the cash consideration was paid at each transaction closing and a portion was paid over time.
 
On June 2, 2017, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) in which the Company purchased all issued and outstanding Units of Security Grade Protective Services, Ltd. (“Security Grade”), which was comprised of 800,000 Class A Units and 200,000 Class B Units. At closing, the Company delivered $800,000 in cash and 207,427 non-qualified stock options (the “Initial Stock Options”). Furthermore, provided that, within the first 60 days following the closing, no material customer identified in the Agreement terminates its contractual relationship with the Company and that all contracts with such material customers are in full force and effect without default or cancellation as of the 60th day following the closing, on the 61st day following the closing, the Company shall issue 207,427 additional stock options (the “Additional Stock Options”). The Company subsequently issued the 207,427 additional stock options on August 1, 2017 as well as a second cash payment of $800,000 pursuant to the original terms of the Agreement.
 
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company notified the selling members of Security Grade its intent on exercising its right of setoff noted in the Agreement after discovering misrepresentations made by the selling members of Security Grade. The Company settled with all of the six selling members during 2018. See Note 6 for further details surrounding the settlements.
 
On March 3, 2018, Helix TCS, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Helix Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Bio-Tech Medical Software, Inc. (“BioTrackTHC”) and Terence J. Ferraro, as the representative of the BioTrackTHC stockholders, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into BioTrackTHC (the “Merger”).
 
On June 1, 2018 (the “BioTrackTHC Closing Date”), in connection with closing the Merger, the Company issued 38,184,985 unregistered shares of its common stock to BioTrackTHC stockholders, of which 1,852,677 shares were held back to satisfy indemnification obligations in the Merger Agreement, if necessary. The Company also assumed the Bio-Tech Medical Software, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (“BioTrackTHC Stock Plan”), pursuant to which options exercisable in the amount of 8,132,410 shares of common stock are outstanding. As a result, BioTrackTHC stockholders owned approximately 48% of the Company on a fully diluted basis as of the BioTrackTHC Closing Date.
 
On August 3, 2018 (the “Engeni Closing Date”), the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Engeni Merger Sub, LLC (“Engeni Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Engeni Merger Agreement”) with Engeni LLC (“Engeni US”), Engeni S.A (“Engeni SA”), Scott Zienkewicz, Nicolas Heller and Alberto Pardo Saleme (the “Engeni US members”), and Scott Zienkewicz, as the representative of the Engeni US members. Pursuant to the Engeni Merger Agreement, Engeni Merger Sub merged with and into Engeni US, with Engeni US surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Engeni Merger”).
 
On the Engeni Closing Date, in connection with closing the Engeni Merger Agreement, the Company issued 366,700 shares of Company common stock to Engeni US members. Furthermore, the Company will also issue Engeni US members 366,700 and 366,600 shares of Company common stock upon achievement of specific objectives. If applicable, the Company will pay Engeni US members the aggregate amount of $100,000, on a pro rata basis, if Engeni SA reaches financial breakeven on or before December 31, 2018, as determined by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Scott Zienkewicz. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not paid this amount to the Engeni US members.

Cannabase
 
Cannabase is an online community for registered legal cannabis license holders to be able to buy and sell wholesale cannabis legally and transparently. As of December 31, 2018, a majority of the users are in the state of Colorado. We continue to develop the wholesale market by integrating it with other operations in order to provide a single, compliant, and transparent wholesale market that can operate as a real-time commodity exchange. We expect 2019 to be a year of significant activity for this business line.
 
BioTrackTHC
 
BioTrackTHC has been rated as the largest retail seed-to-sale compliance software provider by market share, and continued to grow in 2018. The business has tracked over $18bn of legal cannabis transactions, and has expanded into Europe and Latin America, in addition to its 2,000+ client locations, and 9 government contracts. BioTrackTHC’s transactional and technological capabilities form the backbone of an integrated services platform that we have built over the last 36 months, and will continue to build and deploy in 2019. In any version of full legalization in the United States, seed-to-sale tracking in commercial locations will be the key compliance tool used by governments to regulate the massive legal cannabis market.
 
Security Services
 
Security is a primary concern for licensed cannabis businesses and the state regulators who oversee such programs. Facilities with cannabis permits must adopt strong security systems to protect their businesses and comply with regulations. These businesses maintain valuable inventories onsite and typically also have significant cash holdings since transactions are often conducted in cash. Such facilities are exposed to theft both from outsiders and employees. In addition, business operators in most legal cannabis states must show regulatory agencies that security systems carefully protect and track inventories and transactions. Failure to do so could not only result in large losses, but would also threaten businesses’ operating permits and force closure. In Colorado, for example, adult cannabis use laws stress the need for on premise security to control and enforce the age restrictions and act as a general deterrent to unlawful activity.
 
We provide effective security solutions to cannabis businesses, including assessments and planning, security system design and implementation, asset protection, transport, and assurance of security for the state licensing process. All systems and services are guaranteed to meet individual state regulatory requirements and to achieve compliance.

Industry and Regulatory Background
 
In the 1930’s, Congress made marijuana illegal on the federal level, and it was scheduled as a narcotic. In the 1960s and 1970s, as the popularity of marijuana use grew, states began to realize that they needed drug policies consistent with the community and consumer use of marijuana. Under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is currently classified as a “Schedule I” controlled substance. The level of enforcement in states varies widely regarding marijuana.
 
In 1996, Oregon and California passed legislation that legalized the possession and consumption of marijuana use for medical purposes. As of December 31, 2018, thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana in one form or another. The Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska state policies to legalize recreational marijuana were not challenged by federal authorities, which was largely due to the guidance put forth in the August 29, 2013 memorandum from James Cole, the U.S. Deputy Attorney General, titled “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement” (the “Cole Memo”). This memorandum states that federal enforcement agencies are unlikely to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in states where marijuana has been legalized, and where the regulation and control is functional. As of December 31, 2018, ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis use.
 
On the federal level, marijuana has been considered an illegal substance since 1930. This has caused various impediments to the marijuana industry, the most prominent of which is in banking. Although the U.S. Treasury has provided guidance intended to give banks the confidence that they can work with marijuana businesses in legal cannabis states, many banks are still reluctant to do so.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is categorized as a “Schedule I” controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice. It is currently illegal to grow, possess, sell, purchase, and/or consume cannabis under Federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medicinal use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice also characterizes Schedule I controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological and/or physical dependence.

Despite this, thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have passed state laws that permit doctors to prescribe cannabis for medicinal use. Additionally, ten states, and the District of Columbia, have enacted laws that allow recreational adult use of cannabis. As a result of the foregoing, an unpredictable business environment has been created for cannabis companies that can legally operate under state laws but are nonetheless openly in violation of Federal laws. On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under state law, so long as:
 

● | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In January 2018, the Trump administration rescinded the Obama-era directive of easing federal enforcement on legalized marijuana usage. The subsequent departure of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General has signaled to the industry a potential softening of the federal government’s stance, and the recent introduction of a banking bill that would allow the cannabis industry to obtain banking services if enacted into law would also be a positive step.
 
The Market
 
The market has two categories of participants: consumers (i.e. users, retail buyers, individuals) and businesses (i.e. operators, cultivators, retailers, processors, etc.). Consumers are those that are permitted to use marijuana for medicinal purposes and have received medical advice from physicians for conditions that qualify for treatment with cannabis under state-specific guidelines. In ten states and the District of Columbia, anyone who is 21 years or older can consume cannabis products for medical purposes as described above, or for recreational purposes. 
 
Businesses include companies that handle marijuana directly, including cultivators, processors, dispensaries and retail distributors. Also, included in businesses are companies that do not directly handle the marijuana plant or products, but benefit from the industry as participating ancillary businesses (i.e. equipment manufacturers, insurance companies, lenders, etc.).
 
Legal cannabis businesses that produce and distribute cannabis products serve patient and adult consumer populations in states that have passed and enforce cannabis laws. As more states adopt marijuana regulations to legalize cannabis, the number of businesses in the industry may accelerate rapidly.
 
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
In 2019, we will continue to focus on key U.S. states such as California and Nevada, and will accelerate our international expansion.
 
Growth within these geographies, in addition to new states coming online and the expansion of cannabis programs in mature state markets, will increase the addressable market. These expanded state regulatory approvals that permit larger patient bases for medicinal and recreational cannabis use further imply and emphasize the potential for substantial expansion beyond the near-term opportunities.
 
Many states are emulating Colorado’s regulatory model, which requires tight business security, compliance, and adherence to regulations enforced by state and industry oversight agencies. Helix’s experience with compliance in multiple states and municipalities provides a significant competitive advantage for serving businesses in new markets, especially those that are adopting rules similar to the Colorado cannabis laws.

   The cannabis industry is expanding, not only in terms of the number of states with cannabis laws, but also in the scope of business transactions allowed under state regulations. Ten states and the District of Columbia, for example, have approved the legal sale of marijuana for both recreational and medicinal use. This has increased cannabis sales, revenue, and taxes in those states, when compared to the market size of medicinal cannabis alone. The successful results of these state cannabis programs provide viable incentives for other states to legalize cannabis for recreational use, a few of which legalized recreational cannabis use in the November 2016 election.
 
Helix expanded operations through its acquisition of BioTrackTHC in June 2018. BioTrack is the leader in the seed-to-sale tracking software provided to both governments and commercial enterprises. BioTrack has customers in every state where cannabis is legal and 6 countries, with over 2,000 customer locations. The subsequent acquisition of Engeni provided Helix a software development platform where the next generation of the BioTrack software is being developed. The enhanced capabilities of this second generation of the software will enable us to continue to experience strong customer acquisition. In addition, Helix will continue to achieve market penetration in key geographies by working with state regulatory agencies around compliance, adding key personnel, word of mouth, client expansion into new markets and targeted marketing campaigns in markets where management feel opportunities are greatest.
 
Business Acquisitions
 
During the second quarter of 2017, we greatly enhanced our core operations with the acquisition of Security Grade. Security Grade is a market leader in the security profession and provides a broad range of services, from security consulting to installation of surveillance technology. Consistent with our team of professionals, Security Grade employs specialists with extensive experience and exposure to all areas of security related services. This strategic acquisition will help field the growing demand in the Legal Cannabis Industry.
 
On March 3, 2018, Helix TCS, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Merger Sub, entered into the Merger Agreement with BioTrackTHC and Terence J. Ferraro, as the representative of the BioTrackTHC stockholders, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into BioTrackTHC.
 
On August 3, 2018, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Engeni Merger Sub, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Engeni US, Engeni SA, the Engeni US members, and Scott Zienkewicz, as the representative of the Engeni US members. Pursuant to the Engeni Merger Agreement, Engeni Merger Sub merged with and into Engeni US, with Engeni US surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Asset Acquisition
 
During March and April 2016, we acquired the assets of Revolutionary. Revolutionary was the founder and operator of Cannabase which aspired to be a wholesale marketplace for the legal cannabis industry. The assets acquired were development stage software, web addresses, and certain trademarks. We have transformed certain intangible assets into business lines that were not explored by Revolutionary prior to the transaction. Revolutionary’s revenue was generated primarily from wholesale brokerage commissions from transactions that were facilitated by the Cannabase platform.
 
Cannabase was a tradename used for an attempt to build an online community. There was virtually no revenue created prior to our acquisition of Revolutionary assets. The Company has and will continue to spend significant capital to attempt to develop this online community. The Company intends to do this by writing new software code, hiring salespeople, and opening into other states. Revolutionary was not scalable on a multi-regional basis due to it being limited to the legal cannabis industry which is operational in certain states. The revenues generated since the asset acquisition have been generated from an advertising business model that was not in effect at Revolutionary. Since only nominal revenues had been generated previous to the acquisition, and the Company has had to, and will continue to, invest substantial capital to transform the software assets acquired for use in a new business model.
 
We are currently in the process of developing advertising, consumer-focused, and data-related business lines using the intellectual property acquired. To achieve the new business plan, we expect it will continue to take significant management time, as well as substantial financial resources in software development, marketing, sales personnel, and technology expenditures.

Competition
 
We have positioned ourselves as an innovative security firm with a recognizable brand that offers effective and consistent services. Our competition in the security services sector of the cannabis industry includes: Blue Line Protection Group, Safe Systems, Inc., Iron Protection Group, and a variety of smaller, local security companies. Certain of these security providers, like Canna Security America, have gone out of business since our last 10-k. We believe that Helix TCS has the largest cannabis-focused security business in the state of Colorado. We believe that we can continue to compete successfully with these companies based on our favorable reputation for outstanding reliability, customer service, and value added. There is no assurance, however, that our ability to deliver services successfully will not be impacted by competition that currently exists or may arise in the future.
 
BioTrackTHC also has multiple competitors. Some are focused solely on government traceability systems. Some are focused solely on point-of-sale software. Some provide all aspects of commercial software. And one company competes with BioTrack in all verticals. As the industry continues to grow, and as more geographies legalize cannabis, we expect more competitors will emerge, while some of the smaller ones will likely cease doing business or be acquired.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 154 full time employees and 24 part time employees. We believe that the employer-employee relationships in our Company are positive. We have no labor union contracts.
