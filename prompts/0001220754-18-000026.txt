Item 1. | Business.

Background

The Providence Service Corporation owns subsidiaries and investments primarily engaged in the provision of healthcare services in the United States and workforce development services internationally. The subsidiaries and other investments in which we hold interests comprise the following segments:

• | Non-Emergency Transportation Services (“NET Services”) – Nationwide manager of non-emergency medical transportation (“NET”) programs for state governments and managed care organizations.


• | Workforce Development Services (“WD Services”) – Global provider of employment preparation and placement services, legal offender rehabilitation services, youth community service programs and certain health related services to eligible participants of government sponsored programs.


• | Matrix Investment – Minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Matrix”), a nationwide provider of in-home care optimization and management solutions, including comprehensive health assessments (“CHAs”), to members of managed care organizations, accounted for as an equity method investment. On February 16, 2018, Matrix acquired HealthFair, expanding its service offerings to include mobile health assessments, advanced diagnostic testing, and additional care optimization services.


 In addition to its segments’ operations, the Corporate and Other segment includes the Company’s activities at its corporate office that include executive, accounting, finance, internal audit, tax, legal, public reporting, certain strategic and corporate development functions and the results of the Company’s captive insurance company. We are actively monitoring these activities as they relate to our capital allocation and acquisition strategy to ensure alignment with Providence’s overall strategic objectives and its goal of enhancing shareholder value.

The Company is a Delaware corporation formed in 1996 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.

Business Strategies 
Our businesses are operated on a decentralized basis and do not share any integrated functions such as sales, marketing, purchasing, human resources, accounting, finance or legal. They pursue strategies reflective of their respective industries and operating models. Our segments’ core competencies include developing and managing large provider networks, tailoring healthcare and workforce development service offerings to the unique needs of diverse communities and populations, and implementing technology-enabled delivery models to achieve superior outcomes in low cost settings. We pursue both organic and inorganic growth through entry into adjacent markets and complementary service lines, particularly with offerings that may leverage the advantages inherent in our large-scale, technology-enabled, networks. In particular, as it relates to inorganic growth, we are actively evaluating the optimal industry sectors, such as the non-emergency medical transportation industry and others in which businesses complementary to our NET Services business operate, around which to focus our merger and acquisition activity. This ongoing evaluation takes into consideration and balances a number of factors, including the strategic goals, competitive landscape, and growth opportunities of our current segments, in an attempt to direct our capital towards those areas of our business most likely to drive long-term value creation and generate the highest levels of return for our shareholders. We also may enter into strategic partnerships or dispose of businesses, as demonstrated by the Matrix Transaction (defined below) and the Human Services Sale (defined below), based on a variety of factors, including availability of alternative opportunities to deploy capital or otherwise maximize shareholder value as well as other strategic considerations. The outcome of our active evaluation of the optimal industry sectors around which to focus our merger and acquisition activity as well as the potential future entry into strategic partnerships or potential disposition of businesses may impact the extent and manner in which we deploy resources across Providence, including strategic and administrative resources between Corporate and Other and our operating segments.
Discontinued Operations
On October 19, 2016, affiliates of Frazier Healthcare Partners purchased a controlling equity interest in Matrix, with Providence retaining a noncontrolling equity interest (the “Matrix Transaction”). Matrix’s financial results prior to October 19, 2016 are presented as a discontinued operation. In addition, on November 1, 2015, the Company completed its sale of the Human Services Segment (the “Human Services Sale”), which is accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
Description of Our Segments
The Company operates in two principal business segments, NET Services and WD Services. In addition, Providence holds a noncontrolling interest in Matrix, which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes (the “Matrix Investment”). Financial information about segments and geographic areas, including revenues, operating income (loss), and long-lived assets of each segment, is included in Note 21, Segments, to our consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our operations and investments.

NET Services

Services offered. NET Services provides non-emergency transportation solutions to clients in 38 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 23.6 million individuals were eligible to receive our transportation services, and during 2017, NET Services managed 66.8 million trips. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, NET Services accounted for 81.2%, 78.2% and 73.3%, respectively, of Providence’s consolidated service revenue, net.

NET Services primarily contracts with state Medicaid programs and managed care organizations (“MCOs” and collectively “NET customers”) for the coordination of their members’ (“NET end-users”) non-emergency transportation needs. NET end-users are typically Medicaid or Medicare eligible members, whose limited mobility or financial resources hinders their ability to access necessary healthcare and social services. We believe our transportation services enable access to care that not only improves the quality of life and health of the populations we serve, but also enables many of the individuals we serve to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings.

NET Services program delivery is dependent upon a highly-integrated technology platform and business process as well as the management of a multifaceted network of subcontracted transportation providers. Our technology platform is purpose-built for the unique needs of our industry and is highly scalable, capable of supporting substantial growth in our clients’ current and future membership base. In addition, our technology platform efficiently provides a broad interconnectivity among NET end-users, NET customers, and our network of transportation providers. We believe this technological capability and our industry experience uniquely position us as a future focal point in the evolving healthcare industry to introduce valuable population insights. In 2016 and 2017, we introduced service offerings and new technological features for NET end-users to improve service levels, lower costs and build the foundation for additional data analytics capabilities.

4

To fulfill the transportation needs of NET end-users, we apply our proprietary technology platform to an extensive network of approximately 5,100 transportation resources. This includes our in-network roster of fully contracted transportation providers who operate sedans, wheelchair equipped vehicles, multi-passenger vans and ambulances. Our system also utilizes partnerships with on-demand transportation network companies, mass transit entities, mileage reimbursement programs, taxis and county-based emergency medical service providers. To promote safety, quality, and compliance, our in-network transportation providers undergo an in-depth credentialing and education process. Our proprietary technology platform is designed to connect with our external partners’ application program interfaces to improve on-time and on-demand performance, provide real time information and analytics (including live vehicle location data), minimize cancellations and better allow for the scale required to provide an effective, nationwide service.
Our transportation management services also include fraud, waste, and abuse and utilization review programs designed to monitor that our transportation services are provided in compliance with Medicaid program rules and remediate issues that are identified. Compliance controls include ongoing monitoring, auditing and remediation efforts, such as validating NET end-user eligibility for the requested date of service and employing a series of gatekeeping questions to check that the treatment type is covered and the appropriate mode of transportation is assigned. We also conduct post-trip confirmations of attendance directly with the healthcare providers for certain repetitive trips and we employ field monitors to inspect transportation provider vehicles and observe some transports in real time. Our claims validation process generally limits payment to trips that are properly documented, have been authorized in advance, and are billed at the pre-trip estimated amount.
In 2016, NET Services launched a strategic initiative to enhance client and member satisfaction and drive greater operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on developing and deploying new processes and technologies needed to: progress towards an industry-leading call center and reservation scheduling platform; improve member communication, accessibility, and satisfaction; optimize the utilization of our extensive network of transportation providers; and build the foundation for additional analytical capabilities. Implementations under this strategic initiative that were completed in 2017 include new workforce management tools aimed at streamlining our call center operations and decreasing payroll costs, tools and models to better monitor transportation provider performance and capacity availability, and rate setting protocols aimed at lowering transportation costs and improving service quality. The full implementation of the initiative is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018. 

Revenue and customers. In 2017, contracts with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs represented 55.9% and 44.1%, respectively, of NET Services’ revenue. NET Services derived 13.8%, 13.1% and 15.0% of its revenue from a single state Medicaid agency for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The next four largest NET Services customers in the aggregate comprised 22.3%, 22.6% and 24.2% of NET Services’ revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Contracts with state Medicaid agencies are typically for three to five years with multiple renewal options. Contracts with MCOs continue until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice (as determined in accordance with the contract), and allow for regular price adjustments based upon utilization and transportation cost. As of December 31, 2017, 30.8% of NET Services revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that are subject to renewal within the next 12 months. In 2017, NET Services renewed contracts representing 29.5% of its revenue in such year, including its contract with the New Jersey Department of Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, to provide non-emergency medical transportation management services to Medicaid-eligible New Jersey residents.

77.9% of NET Services’ revenue in 2017 was generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements of a specific population based on per-member per-month fees for the number of members in the customer’s program. Revenue is recognized based on the population served during the period. Under certain capitated contracts, partial payment is received as a prepayment during the month service is provided. These partial payments may be due back to the customer, or additional payments may be due to the Company, after each reconciliation period, based on a reconciliation of actual utilization and cost compared to the prepayment made. 22.1% of NET Services’ revenue was generated under other types of fee arrangements, including administrative services only, fee for service (“FFS”), cost plus and flat fee contracts, under which fees are generated based upon billing rates for specific services or defined membership populations. 

Seasonality. While revenue is generally fixed, primarily as a result of the capitated nature of the majority of our contracts, service expense varies based on the utilization of our services. The quarterly operating income and cash flows of NET Services normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.

Competition. We compete with a variety of national organizations that provide similar healthcare and social services related transportation, such as Medical Transportation Management, Southeastrans, Veyo, and American Medical Response, as 
5

well as local and regional providers. Most local competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties or small geographic territories whereas we and other larger competitors seek to win contracts for an entire state or large regional area. We compete based upon a number of factors, including our nationwide network, technical expertise, experience, service capability, service quality, and price.
Business development. Our sales and marketing strategy relies on a concentrated business development effort, with centralized marketing programs. Due to the critical nature of our services, our customers rely upon our past delivery performance record, network development and management expertise, technical expertise and capability, and specialized knowledge. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from long-term, repeat customers. Our long-term strategy is to improve our position as the preferred provider of transportation, complementary network-based services and data analytics offerings to a broad array of healthcare payers. Key elements of our long-term strategy include continued investment in our technologies, enabling us to both lower costs and improve service delivery. We also consider acquisitions of businesses that serve our market or leverage our nationwide infrastructure.

WD Services

Services offered. WD Services is a global provider of employment preparation and placement services, legal offender rehabilitation services, youth community service programs and certain health related services to eligible participants of government sponsored programs. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, WD Services accounted for 18.8%, 21.8% and 26.7%, respectively, of Providence’s consolidated revenue.

WD Services’ end user client base (“WD end-users”) is broad and includes the disabled, recently and long-term unemployed and individuals seeking new skills, as well as individuals that are coping with medical illnesses, are newly graduated from educational institutions, or are being released from incarceration.
As of December 31, 2017, WD Services operated in 10 countries outside of the U.S. These countries included the United Kingdom (“UK”), France, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Canada, Germany, Australia, Switzerland and Singapore. WD Services also holds a noncontrolling interest in a joint venture in Spain.
In order to build upon its leadership position in the UK employment services industry, enhance client satisfaction and drive greater operational efficiencies, WD Services implemented the Ingeus Futures program, which was substantially completed in 2017. This program included organizational restructuring, the development and deployment of new processes and technologies, and increased business development resources. Each aspect of the program was aimed at improving operational efficiencies and client services as well as developing the internal capabilities necessary to ensure long-term profitable growth in the employment, training and healthcare industries.

Revenue, customers and clients. The majority of WD Services’ revenue is generated through the provision of employability, legal offender rehabilitation and training programs to national government entities seeking to reduce unemployment or recidivism rates. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 61.4%, 68.3% and 75.5%, respectively, of WD Services’ revenue was derived from operations in the UK, with 38.6%, 31.7% and 24.5%, respectively, derived from operations outside the UK. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, 19.6%, 28.9% and 40.0% of WD Services’ revenue was derived from a contract with the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions for employability services and 27.1%, 25.9% and 28.2% of WD Services’ revenue was derived from a contract with the UK government’s Ministry of Justice (the “MOJ”), for legal offender rehabilitation services. Revenue under the UK employability services contract is decreasing as expected, as referrals ended under this program in March 31, 2017. In late 2017, WD Services was awarded three new employability contracts and one sub-contract under the new Work and Health Programme in the UK, allowing Ingeus to continue to maintain its position as a leader in the UK workforce development market, although overall this program has a smaller scale than the legacy employability services contract. During 2017, there was negligible revenue under the new Work and Health Programme.

The revenue earned by WD Services under its contracts is often derived through a combination of different revenue channels including, but not limited to, fees contingent upon: (1) the volume of WD end-users referred to and/or admitted into a specific program, (2) the achievement of defined outcomes for specific individuals, such as a job placement or continued employment and (3) the achievement of defined outcomes for a population of individuals over a specific time period, such as aggregate employment or recidivism rates. The relative contributions of different revenue channels under a specific contract can fluctuate meaningfully over the life of a contract and thus contribute to significant earnings volatility. Revenue recognition related to our National Citizen Services (“NCS”) youth programs can be particularly volatile due to the timing of services provided, which typically occur in the second and third quarters of each year. WD Services also earns revenue under fixed FFS arrangements, based 
6

upon contractual rates established at the outset of the contract or the applicable contract year, although the rate may be prospectively adjusted during the contract year based upon actual volumes. Volume levels are typically not guaranteed under contracts.  

The nature of the services offered by WD Services often relies on our ability to improve a certain set of outcomes at a reduced cost versus previously utilized in-sourced delivery models. As a result, as we commence new contracts using transformational delivery models, we are often required to invest significant upfront capital for information technology, human resources, facilities and other onboarding costs, such as consultants and redundancy payments. The level of upfront funding required is dependent upon the size and nature of the contract. Although significant upfront funding may be required, revenues are often payable only as services are delivered and, in some cases, only after incentive measures have been achieved over a multi-year period. As a result of these two factors, there can be significant variability in our earnings from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. In addition, under the majority of WD Services’ contracts, the Company relies on its customers, which include government agencies, to provide referrals, for which the Company can provide services and earn revenue. The timing and magnitude of referrals can fluctuate significantly, leading to volatility in revenue. The Company also relies on certain customers to periodically provide information regarding the achievement of service delivery targets, which information could result in reductions in future payments if targets are not met. As a result, we often measure a contracts success over the entire term of the contract and believe the financial results of WD Services are best viewed from a multi-year perspective.
The MOJ is currently reviewing its program for outsourcing probationary services, which includes its contracts with our subsidiary Reducing Reoffending Partnership (“RRP”), which is in our WD Services segment. The review includes an investigation regarding sustainability of the economic terms of such contracts, as well as data relating to reoffending statistics and other factors that could impact contractual performance measures. The potential impact of this review on RRP’s agreement with the MOJ, including with respect to any potential payments to the MOJ that may be required, cannot be determined at this time because the review is ongoing. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, we could be liable for damages and financial penalties, which may place existing pledged performance and payment bonds at risk as well as harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts and future bonds.”
Seasonality. While there has been period-to-period variability in WD Services’ earnings due to the factors discussed above and also set forth in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Revenues and Expenses – WD Services”, there has not been a material seasonal effect on WD Services’ results of operations.

Competition. In the UK, U.S., Saudi Arabia and Singapore the workforce development market is served by large, often multi-national, corporations, along with national and regional for-profit and non-profit entities. In Canada, France, Germany, South Korea, Spain and Switzerland, our competition is primarily companies specific to the geography, nationally or regionally, and both privately owned for-profit and non-profit entities. In the UK, the offender rehabilitation market is served by large corporations, often working with charitable sector providers. In general our larger competitors internationally include Maximus, Interserve, Sodexo, The Reed Group and Working Links.

The market for services to governments is competitive and subject to change and pricing pressure, particularly during the bidding for new contracts and contract renewals. However, due to the critical nature of our offerings and the WD end-users we serve, market entry can be difficult for new entrants or those without prior established track-records. Other barriers to entry include operational service complexity and significant upfront investments. This can include establishment of complex IT systems which often must interface with government systems, significant monitoring and reporting obligations, delivery from sites across wide geographies, and management and development of supply chains.

Business development. Our business development activities are performed both locally and centrally from WD Services’ London headquarters. Through local and global networks and relationships, we become aware of new opportunities for which we develop bids through competitive processes. The nature of the competitive processes varies from highly competitive to being one of a few providers, or the sole provider, to bid on a contract. We pursue only those contracts that meet certain investment criteria, including risk-weighted return on capital thresholds, and involve the provision of services where we believe our experience will allow us to deliver differentiated and improved outcomes for our clients. 

Matrix Investment

Providence’s Matrix Investment is comprised of our interest in Matrix. Since the completion of the Matrix Transaction, the Company has had a noncontrolling equity interest in Matrix. The Company and an affiliate of Frazier Health Partners (the “Frazier Subscriber”), which holds the controlling equity interest in Matrix, are party to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”) of Mercury Parent, LLC, the company through which the parties hold their equity interests in Matrix. The Operating Agreement sets forth certain terms and conditions regarding the ownership by the Company and Frazier Subscriber of interests in Mercury Parent and their indirect ownership of common stock of Matrix, and 
7

provides for, among other things, certain liquidity and governance rights and other obligations and rights, in each case, on the terms and conditions contained therein. 
At December 31, 2017, the Company owned a 46.6% noncontrolling interest in Matrix. Prior to the closing of the Matrix Transaction, the financial results of Matrix were included in our Health Assessment Services (“HA Services”) segment. The Company’s proportionate share of Matrix’s net assets and financial results for the period following the closing of the Matrix Transaction are presented under the equity method. The assets, liabilities and financial results of Matrix for the period prior to the closing of the Matrix Transaction are presented within discontinued operations. For additional information regarding the Matrix Transaction, see Note 20, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements.

Services offered. Matrix provides in-home care optimization and care management solutions, which include CHAs. As of December 31, 2017, Matrix utilized a national network of over 5,800 clinical providers, including 1,700 nurse practitioners (“NPs”), located across 50 states, to provide its services primarily to members of Medicare Advantage (“MA”) health plans. 
Matrix recently expanded its provider network and service offerings through a series of acquisitions. In December 2017, Matrix grew its clinical provider network through its acquisition of LP Health Services, a provider of quality and wellness visits on behalf of Medicaid/Duals managed care plans across the U.S., for a purchase price of $3.8 million. LP Health Services’ revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $6 million. 
In February 2018, Matrix completed its acquisition of HealthFair, a leading operator of mobile clinics which offer preventative health assessment and advanced diagnostic testing services, including laboratory, ultrasound, EKG and mammography testing, for a purchase price of $160 million plus an earnout payment contingent on HealthFair’s 2018 performance. With the addition of HealthFair, Matrix’s network increased to more than 6,000 community-based providers across all 50 states, including over 1,700 NPs. We believe the combination of the two organizations will provide health plan members with more convenient access to important care management and preventative health services. As a result of the rollover of certain equity interests of HealthFair, Providence’s equity ownership in Matrix was 43.6% as of February 16, 2018. HealthFair’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $45 million. 
Matrix primarily generates revenue from CHAs, which obtain a health plan members’ information related to health status, social, environmental and medical risks and help the MA plans improve the accuracy of such information. Matrix’s services typically commence with a member analysis that utilizes client data, such as medical claims data, to maximize its ability to improve client and member outcomes as a result of the assessment process. Through Matrix’s contact centers, which include approximately 160 colleagues, Matrix pursues additional data collection and schedules assessments. Matrix’s NPs then conduct a CHA, which is comprised of a physical examination and other diagnostic services, in the member’s home. Matrix also operates a care management offering which provides additional data analytics and chronic care management services.

Matrix’s services are dependent upon its technology platform which integrates the clinical provider network, operations infrastructure, call centers and clients. Matrix’s platform is designed for the unique needs of its industry, is highly scalable and can support substantial growth. We believe Matrix’s network and platform positions Matrix as a future focal point in the evolving healthcare industry in the introduction of both additional population insights and care management services. With data provided by its health plan clients, Matrix utilizes analytics to determine which members it can most effectively lower costs and improve outcomes through face-to-face engagements with clinicians. Each program is customized and is served by a comprehensive team of case managers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and trained call center colleagues.

Revenue, customers and clients. As of December 31, 2017, Matrix’s customers included 48 health plans, including for-profit multi-state health plans and non-profit health plans that operate in only one state or several counties within one state. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Matrix’s top five customers accounted for 72.2% of its revenue, as its largest customer accounted for 30.9% of its revenue and its second largest customer account for 26.8% of its revenue. Matrix enters into annual or multi-annual contracts with its customers under which it is paid on a per assessment basis.

Seasonality. The Company attempts to perform CHAs evenly throughout the year to efficiently utilize NP capacity, although the timing of performance is driven by client demand. 

Competition. We believe that Matrix and CenseoHealth, which announced in December 2017 a combination with Advance Health, a smaller competitor, are the largest independent providers of CHAs to the health plan market. There are many smaller competitors, such as EMSI Healthcare Services, MedXM, which was acquired by Quest Diagnostics on February 1, 2018, and Inovalon. In addition, some health plans in-source CHA services. Matrix’s chronic care management competitors include Landmark Healthcare, PopHealthcare and Optum.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 7,100 employees across Providence and our subsidiaries. Of such employees, approximately 3,800 work in NET Services and approximately 3,300 work in WD Services. In addition, 30 employees primarily conduct corporate activities.  

None of our U.S. employees are members of a union. We have nearly 1,950 and 330 full-time employees in the UK and France, respectively. Certain of our UK employees are members of the NAPO and Unison unions and certain of our employees in France are members of the Confederation Generale du Travail and have collective bargaining rights. In other countries employees may be members of a trade union but these trade unions are not formally recognized by us. Participation in unions is confidential under European employment laws. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, both unionized and non-unionized, in the U.S. and internationally.

Regulatory Environment

NET Services and Matrix Investment

Overview

Our NET Services and Matrix Investment segments (the “U.S. Healthcare Segments”) are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and agency guidance (collectively, “Laws”). These Laws significantly affect the way in which these segments operate various aspects of their businesses. Our U.S. Healthcare Segments must also comply with state and local licensing requirements, state and federal requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, requirements for contracting with MA plans, and contractual requirements imposed upon them by the federal, state and local agencies and third-party commercial customers to which they provide services. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ ability to be paid for the services they provide and be authorized to provide services on an ongoing basis.

The Medicare and Medicaid programs are governed by significant and complex Laws.  Both Medicare and Medicaid are financed, at least in part, with federal funds. Therefore, any direct or indirect recipients of those funds are subject to federal fraud, waste and abuse Laws.  In addition, there are federal privacy and security Laws that govern the healthcare industry. State Laws primarily pertain to the licensure of certain categories of healthcare professionals and providers and the state’s interest in regulating the quality of healthcare in the state, regardless of the source of payment, but may also include state Laws pertaining to fraud, waste and abuse, privacy and security Laws, and the state’s regulation of its Medicaid program. Federal and state regulatory laws that may affect our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ businesses, include, but are not limited to the following:

• | false and other improper claims or false statements Laws pertaining to reimbursement;


• | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement and code set regulations and guidance, along with evolving state Laws protecting patient privacy and requiring notifications of unauthorized access to, or use of, patient medical information;


• | civil monetary penalties Law;


• | anti-kickback Laws;


• | the Stark Law and other self-referral, financial inducement, fee splitting, and patient brokering Laws;


• | CMS regulations pertaining to Medicare as well as CMS releases applicable to the operation of MA plans, such as reimbursement rates, risk adjustment and data collection methodologies, adjustments to quality management measurements and other relevant factors; and


• | state licensure laws.


A violation of certain of these Laws could result in civil and criminal damages and penalties, the refund of monies paid by government or private payers, our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ exclusion from participation in federal healthcare payer programs, or the loss of our segments’ license to conduct business within a particular state’s boundaries. 

Federal Law

Federal healthcare Laws apply in any case in which our U.S. Healthcare Segments are providing an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to such segments’ customers that results in reimbursement by a federal healthcare payer program to such segments or to them. The principal federal Laws that affect our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ businesses include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with federal healthcare payer programs and those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federal healthcare payer programs.

False and Other Improper Claims

Under the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733) and similar state Laws, the government may impose civil liability on our U.S. Healthcare Segments if they knowingly submit a false claim to the government or cause another to submit a false claim to the government, or knowingly make a false record or statement intended to get a false claim paid by the government. The False Claims Act defines a claim as a demand for money or property made directly to the government or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the money is to be spent on the government’s behalf or if the government will reimburse the contractor or grantee. Liability can be incurred for submitting (or causing another to submit) false claims with actual knowledge or for submitting false claims with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance. Liability can also be incurred for knowingly making or using a false record or statement to receive payment from the federal government or for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. Consequently, a provider need not take an affirmative action to conceal or avoid an obligation to the government, but the mere retention of an overpayment from the government could lead to potential liability under the False Claims Act.

Many states also have similar false claims statutes. In addition, healthcare fraud is a priority of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), its program integrity contractors and its Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state Attorneys General. These agencies have devoted a significant amount of resources to investigating healthcare fraud.

If our U.S. Healthcare Segments are ever found to have violated the False Claims Act, they could be required to make significant payments to the government (including damages and penalties in addition to the return of reimbursements previously collected) and could be excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs or providing services to entities which contract with those programs. Although our U.S. Healthcare Segments monitor their billing practices for compliance with applicable laws, such laws are very complex, and they might not be able to detect all errors or interpret such laws in a manner consistent with a court or an agency’s interpretation. While the criminal statutes generally are reserved for instances evidencing fraudulent intent, the civil and administrative penalty statutes are being applied by the federal government in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. Examples of the types of activities giving rise to liability for filing false claims include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting services rendered (i.e., miscoding), applications for duplicate reimbursement and providing false information that results in reimbursement or impacts reimbursement amounts. Additionally, the federal government takes the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary. The federal government also takes the position that claiming reimbursement for services that are substandard is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard. Criminal penalties also are available even in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate any of the federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes.

State Medicaid agencies and state Attorneys General also have authority to seek criminal or civil sanctions for fraud and abuse violations. In addition, private insurers may bring actions under state false claim laws. In certain circumstances, federal and state laws authorize private whistleblowers to bring false claim or “qui tam” suits on behalf of the government against providers and reward the whistleblower with a portion of any final recovery. In addition, the federal government has engaged a number of private audit organizations to assist it in tracking and recovering claims for healthcare services that may have been improperly submitted.

Governmental investigations and whistleblower “qui tam” suits against healthcare companies have increased significantly in recent years, and have resulted in substantial penalties and fines and exclusions of persons and entities from participating in government healthcare programs. For more information on the risks related to a failure to comply with applicable government coding and billing rules, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our segments could be subject to actions for false claims or recoupment of funds pursuant to certain audits if they do not comply with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our segments’ operating results.”

Health Information Practices

Under HIPAA, DHHS issued rules to define and implement standards for the electronic transactions and code sets for the submission of transactions such as claims, and privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in whatever manner it is maintained.

The Final Rule on Enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions, including the transaction standards, the security standards and the privacy rule, published by DHHS addresses, among other issues, DHHS’s policies for determining violations and calculating civil monetary penalties, how DHHS will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and various procedural issues. The rule extends enforcement provisions currently applicable to the

healthcare privacy regulations to other HIPAA standards, including security, transactions and the appropriate use of service code sets.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extends certain of HIPAA’s obligations to parties providing services to healthcare entities covered by HIPAA known as “business associates,” imposes new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations, extends enforcement powers to state attorney generals and amends the HIPAA privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of HIPAA. HITECH establishes four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation, and a maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision. With the additional HIPAA enforcement power under HITECH, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services and states are increasing their investigations and enforcement of HIPAA compliance. Our U.S. Healthcare Segments have taken steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA and we are monitoring compliance on an ongoing basis.

Additionally, the HITECH Final Rule imposes various requirements on covered entities and business associates, and expands the definition of “business associates” to cover contractors of business associates. Even when our U.S. Healthcare Segments are not operating as covered entities, they may be deemed to be “business associates” for HIPAA rule purposes of such covered entities. Our U.S. Healthcare Segments monitor their compliance obligations under HIPAA as modified by HITECH, and implement operational and systems changes, associate training and education, conduct risk assessments and allocate resources as needed. Any noncompliance with HIPPA requirements could expose such segments to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under HITECH and require them to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements or to remediate potential issues that may arise.

Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws

Federal law commonly known as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value (direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind) which is intended to induce: the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs; or the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any service or item for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs.

Interpretations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have been very broad and under current Law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Even bona fide investment interests in a healthcare provider may be questioned under the Anti-Kickback Statute if the government concludes that the opportunity to invest was offered as an inducement for referrals.

This act is subject to numerous statutory and regulatory “safe harbors.” Compliance with the requirements of a safe harbor offers defenses against Anti-Kickback Statute allegations. Failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. However, it may mean that such an arrangement will be subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authorities.

Many states, including some where our U.S. Healthcare Segments do business, have adopted anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state laws are very closely patterned on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; others, however, are broader and reach reimbursement by private payers. If our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ activities were deemed to be inconsistent with state anti-kickback or illegal remuneration laws, they could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such activities, any of which could harm such segments’ businesses.
If our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or applicable state laws, these segments, along with their clients would be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and these segments’ arrangements would not be legally enforceable, which could materially and adversely affect their business. For more information on the risks related to failure to comply with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our segments’ business could be subject to civil penalties and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable bribery, corruption and other regulations governing business with governments.”

Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions

Our U.S. Healthcare Segments may be subject to federal and state statutes banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from making a “referral” for “designated health services” for 
11

Medicare (and in many cases Medicaid) patients from entities or facilities in which such physicians directly or indirectly hold a “financial relationship”.

A financial relationship can take the form of a direct or indirect ownership, investment or compensation arrangement. A referral includes the request by a physician for, or ordering of, or the certifying or recertifying the need for, any designated health services.

Certain services that our U.S. Healthcare Segments provide may be identified as “designated health services” for purposes of the Stark Law. Such segments cannot provide assurance that future regulatory changes will not result in other services they provide becoming subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future.

Many states, including some states where our U.S. Healthcare Segments do business, have adopted similar or broader prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of clients. Moreover, many states where such segments operate have laws similar to the Stark Law prohibiting physician self-referrals. While our U.S. Healthcare Segments believe that they are operating in compliance with the Stark Law, there can be no guarantee that violations will not occur. 

Healthcare Reform

On March 23, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive health reform through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 11-148) (“PPACA”). On March 30, 2010, the President signed a reconciliation budget bill that included amendments to the PPACA (Pub. L. 11-152). These laws in combination form the “ACA” referred to herein. The changes to various aspects of the healthcare system in the ACA were far-reaching and included, among many others, substantial adjustments to Medicare reimbursement, establishment of individual mandates for healthcare coverage, extension of coverage to certain populations, expansion of Medicaid, restrictions on physician-owned hospitals, and increased efficiency and oversight provisions.

Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, while others will take effect later or will be phased in over time, ranging from a few months following approval to ten years. Due to the complexity of the ACA, it is likely that additional legislation will be considered and enacted. The ACA requires the promulgation of regulations that will likely have significant effects on the healthcare industry and third-party payers. Thus, the healthcare industry and our operations may be subjected to significant new statutory and regulatory requirements and contractual terms and conditions, and consequently to structural and operational changes and challenges.

The ACA also implemented significant changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws that intensify the risks and consequences of enforcement actions. These included expansion of the False Claims Act by: (a) narrowing the public disclosure bar; and (b) explicitly stating that violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute trigger false claims liability. In addition, the ACA lessened the intent requirements under the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person may violate the statute without knowledge or specific intent. The ACA also provided new funding and expanded powers to investigate fraud, including through expansion of the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program to Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid and authorizing the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud. Finally, the legislation created enhanced penalties for noncompliance, including increased criminal penalties and expansion of administrative penalties under Medicare and Medicaid. Collectively, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ operations.

On January 20, 2017, the President of the United States issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to take steps to ensure the government’s implementation of the ACA minimizes the burden on impacted parties (such as individuals and states). The underlying intent of the executive order was to take the first steps to repeal and replace the ACA. The executive order specifically instructed agencies to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay implementation of provisions” that place a “fiscal burden on any State” or that impose a “cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden” on stakeholders including patients, providers, and insurers. The order stated that any changes should be made only to the extent “permitted by law” and should comply with the law governing administrative rule-making. The executive order did not, however, provide specifics on next steps or provisions that would be reexamined nor was it clear how the executive branch would be reconciled with Republican congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA or what portions of the ACA may continue in any replacement legislation. There are multiple pending legislative proposals to amend the ACA which, among other effects, could repeal all or parts of the ACA without replacing its extension of coverage to expansion populations. In addition, there are pending legislative proposals to materially restructure Medicaid and other government health care programs.
In 2017, legislation was proposed in the U.S. Congress, but did not advance out of committee and was not passed, which would reduce or eliminate certain non-emergency medical transportation services provided by NET Services as a required Medicaid 
12

benefit. A similar proposal was made in 2018 by the President of the United States in a federal budget proposal. If additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted, or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged, repealed or invalidated, there could be a material adverse impact on our segments' operating results.

Surveys and Audits

Our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ programs are subject to periodic surveys by government authorities or their contractors to ensure compliance with various requirements. Regulators conducting periodic surveys often provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failures to comply with various regulatory requirements. In most cases, if a deficiency finding is made by a reviewing agency, our segments will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, an agency may take a number of adverse actions against a program, including:
•the imposition of fines or penalties or the recoupment of amounts paid;
•temporary suspension of admission of new clients to our program’s service;
•in extreme circumstances, exclusion from participation in Medicaid, Medicare or other programs;
•revocation of our license; or
•contract termination.

While our U.S. Healthcare Segments believe that our programs are in compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other program certification requirements and state licensure requirements, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on such segments’ businesses and their ability to enter into contracts with other agencies to provide services.

Billing/claims Reviews and Audits

Agencies and other third-party commercial payers periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ claims or other audits in conjunction with their obligations to comply with the requirements of Medicare or Medicaid. In order to conduct these reviews, payers request documentation from our U.S. Healthcare Segments and then review that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Any determination that such segments have not complied with applicable rules and regulations could result in adjustment of payments or the incurrence of fines and penalties, or in situations of significant compliance failures review or non-renewal of related contracts.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting

Some states in which our U.S. Healthcare Segments operate prohibit general business entities, such as these segments, from “practicing medicine,” which definition varies from state to state and can include employing physicians, as well as engaging in fee-splitting arrangements with these healthcare providers. Among other things, our U.S. Healthcare Segments currently contract with and employ NPs to perform CHAs. We believe that such segments have structured their operations appropriately; however, they could be alleged or found to be in violation of some or all of these laws. If a state determines that some portion of our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ businesses violate these laws, it may seek to have such segments discontinue or restructure those portions of their operations or subject them to increased costs, penalties, fines, certain license requirements or other measures. Any determination that such segments have acted improperly in this regard may result in liability to them. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the professional may be considered void and unenforceable.
Professional Licensure and Other Requirements

Many of our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their professions. For example, our mid-level practitioners (e.g., NPs) are subject to state laws requiring physician supervision and state laws governing mid-level scope of practice. As the use of mid-level practitioners by physicians increases, state governing boards are implementing more robust regulations governing mid-levels and their scope of practice under physician supervision. Our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ ability to provide mid-level practitioner services may be restricted by the enactment of new state laws governing mid-level scope of practice and by state agency interpretations and enforcement of such existing laws. In addition, services rendered by mid-level practitioners may not be reimbursed by payors at the same rates as payors may reimburse physicians for the same services. Lastly, professionals who are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as individual providers must not have been excluded from participation in government programs at any time. Our U.S. Healthcare Segments’ ability to provide services depends upon the ability of their personnel to meet individual licensure and other requirements and maintain such licensure in good standing.

WD Services
Overview

As a provider of workforce development services in the U.S. and 10 countries outside the U.S., WD Services is subject to numerous national and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way in which we operate various aspects of our business. WD Services has implemented compliance policies to help assure our compliance with these laws and regulations as they become effective; however, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations in the future could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services or the manner in which we conduct our business.
WD Services’ revenue is primarily derived from contracts that are funded by national governments that are seeking to reduce the overall unemployment rate or improve job placement success for targeted cohorts, and to reduce the recidivism rate. Further, the revenue we receive from these contracts is typically tied to milestones that are largely uncontrolled by us. Such milestones include the job placement success of clients, duration and tenure of clients in jobs once they are placed, and various other market and industry factors including the overall unemployment rate. For more information on the risks related to failure to satisfy our contractual obligations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, we could be liable for damages and financial penalties, which may place existing pledged performance and payment bonds at risk as well as harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts and future bonds.”
Data Security and Protection
WD Services is also subject to the European Union’s and other countries’ data security and protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose broad obligations on the organizations that collect such data, as well as confer broad rights on individuals about whom such data is collected. There are amendments which will come into effect in 2018 with respect to European data privacy legislation which will significantly increase the fines for any breaches. In addition to their power to impose fines, information privacy regulators in Europe have significant powers to require organizations that breach regulations to put in place measures to ensure that such breaches do not occur again, and require businesses to stop processing personal information until the required measures are in place. For more information on the risks related to a failure to comply with privacy and security regulations, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our segments are subject to regulations relating to privacy and security of patient and service user information. Failure to comply with privacy and security regulations could result in a material adverse impact on our segments’ operating results.”
The data security and protection laws and regulations may also restrict the flow of information, including information about employees or service users, from WD Services to Providence in the U.S. In certain instances, informed consent to the data transfer must be given by the affected employee or service user. Compliance with such laws and regulations is costly and requires our segment management to expend substantial time and resources which could negatively impact our segments’ results of operations. Compliance may also make it more difficult for the Company to gather data necessary to ensure the appropriate operation of its internal controls or to detect corruption, resulting in the need for additional controls or increasing the Company’s costs to maintain appropriate controls.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
WD Services’ international operations are subject to various U.S. and foreign statutes that prohibit bribery and corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act. These statutes generally require organizations to prohibit bribery by or for the organization and demand the implementation of systems to counter bribery, including risk management, training and guidance and the maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The statutes also, among other things, prevent the provision of anything of value to government officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. In addition, many countries in which we operate have antitrust or competition regulations which, among other things, prohibit collusive tendering or bid-rigging behavior. For more information on the risks related to a failure to comply with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our segments’ business could be subject to civil penalties and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable bribery, corruption and other regulations governing business with governments.”
Licensing
In many of the locations where WD Services operates, it is required by local laws to obtain and maintain licenses. The applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services our segments provide, the credentials of staff, record keeping, treatment planning, client monitoring and supervision of staff. The failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could 
14

have a material adverse impact on WD Services businesses and could prevent them from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction. 
Surveys and audits

WD Services’ contracts permit clients to review its compliance or performance, as well as its records, at the client’s discretion. In most cases, if a deficiency is found by a reviewing agency, WD Services’ will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In the case of any deficiency, however, a client may take a number of adverse actions against WD Services, including: (i) termination or modification of existing contracts, (ii) prevention of receipt of new contracts or extension of existing contracts or (iii) reduction of fees paid under existing contract.

Billing Requirements

In WD Services, particularly in Europe, our contracts are subject to stringent claims and invoice processing regimes which vary depending on the customer and nature of the payment mechanism. Under European procurement legislation which has been implemented in each EU member state, any conviction for fraud can result in a ban from participating in public procurement tenders for up to five years, or until the organization in question has put in place “self clean” measures to the satisfaction of the procuring authority. For more information on the risks related to a failure to comply with applicable government coding and billing rules, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our segments could be subject to actions for false claims or recoupment of funds pursuant to certain audits if they do not comply with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our segments’ operating results.”
Brexit
On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which eligible persons voted in favor of a proposal that the UK leave the EU, also known as “Brexit”. The result of the referendum increased political and economic uncertainty in the UK for the foreseeable future, in particular during any period where the terms of any UK exit from the EU are negotiated. In turn, Brexit could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future payers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results, operations and prospects, including being adversely affected in ways that cannot be anticipated at present. For more information on the risks related to the UK’s exit from the European Union, see “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Our business could be adversely affected by the referendum on the UK’s exit from the European Union.”
