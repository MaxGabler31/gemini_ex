 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 Our mission is to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others.
 We are a founder-led, direct-to-consumer healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand that seeks to celebrate, empower and serve current and future generations of healthcare professionals. We are committed to helping this growing, global community of professionals, whom we refer to as Awesome Humans, look, feel and perform at their best—24/7, 365 days a year. We create technically advanced apparel and products that feature an unmatched combination of comfort, durability, function and style, all at an affordable price. In doing so, we have redefined what scrubs are—giving rise to our tag-line: why wear scrubs, when you can #wearFIGS?
 We have revolutionized the large and fragmented healthcare apparel market. We branded a previously unbranded industry and de-commoditized a previously commoditized product—elevating scrubs and creating premium products for healthcare professionals. Most importantly, we built a community and lifestyle around a profession. As a result, we have become the industry’s category-defining healthcare apparel and lifestyle brand.
 We generate revenue by selling technically advanced apparel for the modern healthcare professional. Our offerings include scrubwear, as well as lifestyle apparel and other non-scrub offerings, such as lab coats, underscrubs, outerwear, loungewear, compression socks, footwear and masks. We design all of our products in-house, leverage third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our raw materials and finished products, and utilize shallow initial buys and data-driven repurchasing decisions to test new products. We directly and actively manage every step of our product development and production process to ensure that our extremely high quality standards are met. We also have a highly efficient merchandising model—due to the non-discretionary, replenishment nature of healthcare apparel, we maintain low inventory risk driven by a high volume of repeat purchases and a focus on our core scrubs offerings. We primarily market and sell our products through our digital platform, consisting of our website and mobile app, to a rapidly growing community of loyal customers.
 From 2017 to 2021, we grew annual net revenues from $17.6 million to $419.6 million, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 121%.
 We Are Obsessed with Our Community of Awesome Humans.
We are dedicated to empowering and celebrating every healthcare professional across all disciplines and levels of experience. We purposefully design products to serve their particular needs and we sell those products through a convenient direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) digital platform tailored to their around-the-clock lifestyle. We also use our digital platform to celebrate Awesome Humans in aspirational, creative and unexpected ways, and we leverage social media platforms to listen to, engage with, understand and better serve our community of healthcare professionals at scale. Our Ambassador Program consists of Awesome Humans from around the world who represent a diverse cross-section of the healthcare industry and help us interact with and drive engagement with our community. Our differentiated approach to creating authentic and meaningful relationships with our community has allowed us to build a growing base of approximately 1.9 million active customers as of December 31, 2021 who are passionate and loyal to our brand.
Innovation Drives Our Product Development.
Our design philosophy is rooted in Technical Comfort the conviction that design, comfort and function are non-negotiable. While multi-billion-dollar companies were focused on athletes, we believed that nobody was sufficiently focused on healthcare professionals—extraordinary people who deserve to look, feel and perform at their best. As a result, we developed cutting-edge fabric technologies and product designs to specifically address their needs. Our core proprietary fabric technology, called FIONx, offers four-way stretch, anti-odor, anti-wrinkle and moisture-wicking properties. Our scrubs feature easy-to-access zippered pockets for professional and personal items such as stethoscopes, scissors, smartphones and ID badges. Our lifestyle apparel and other non-scrub offerings, such as lab coats, underscrubs, outerwear, loungewear, compression socks, footwear and masks, are specifically designed for the needs and preferences of the medical community.
We Are a Digitally Native Direct-to-Consumer Brand.
We are a digitally native DTC brand that utilizes technology to deliver a differentiated customer experience. We disrupted the industry’s historical brick-and-mortar distribution model and built the largest DTC platform in healthcare apparel. By selling directly through our digital platform, we control all aspects of a seamless, convenient customer experience. Further, we are able to engage with our community of healthcare professionals before, during and after purchase, through our digital platform, email, social media,

podcasts, in-person events and numerous other channels. This direct engagement enables us to establish personal relationships at scale and provides us with valuable customer data and feedback that we leverage across our organization to better serve our community.
We Leverage Data Science to Connect with and Serve Our Community.
We leverage our rich customer data set, bolstered by the inherent benefits of our DTC model, to serve our community more effectively and efficiently. We develop proprietary and customized data solutions designed to optimize our product innovation, inventory analytics, marketing efforts and operational efficiency. We also have teams of data scientists, data engineers and data analysts working directly with each key functional area of the Company. This approach enables us to gather and manage extensive data, and rapidly and directly apply that data to deliver valuable insights that improve our core operating activities and decision-making processes. Our vast and growing data set plays a critical role in driving new customer acquisition as well as in our community engagement and retention strategy.
We Give Back to the Community We Serve.
In line with our purpose-driven mission, giving back is ingrained in everything we do at FIGS and has been from the beginning. When we started FIGS, we created an initiative called Threads for Threads to donate scrubs to healthcare professionals who work in resource-poor countries and lack the proper uniforms to do their jobs safely. By providing clean scrubs to these individuals, we aim to empower them and improve the quality of care they provide. To date, we have donated hundreds of thousands of FIGS scrubs and other products to medical professionals in need around the world.
In an effort to empower and support our healthcare community, we have also given in a variety of other ways, including through medical giving trips, tuition and student loan repayment grants to the next generation of healthcare professionals, financial support to organizations that help uplift the healthcare community, and a wide range of other partnerships and giving initiatives that support the vulnerable communities that our healthcare community serves every day.
Our Market Opportunity
 Healthcare Apparel Is a Large, Growing and Non-Discretionary Industry.
There are approximately 20 million healthcare professionals in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in healthcare occupations in the United States is projected to grow 16% from 2020 to 2030, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 2.6 million new jobs. Healthcare occupations are also projected to add more jobs than any other occupational group.
Within this growing market, healthcare apparel is a fundamentally attractive industry underpinned by its scale, recurring nature and compelling growth outlook. In 2020, the total addressable market of the healthcare apparel industry was an estimated $12.0 billion in the United States alone and $79.0 billion globally, according to an April 2021 Frost & Sullivan study that we commissioned. Unlike most other categories in the apparel sector, the healthcare apparel industry is largely non-discretionary, recession resistant and much less susceptible to fashion or fad risk. Hospitals, medical offices, clinics and laboratories routinely require healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses and medical technicians to wear scrubs, lab coats and other medical apparel during every shift, and the vast majority of medical professionals purchase their own uniforms. Due to frequent wear, healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand for such products.
The Industry Has Historically Lacked Innovation.
Prior to FIGS, the healthcare apparel industry had operated for over 100 years with little change or innovation. Despite attractive market fundamentals, the industry had been held back, and its consumers underserved, by legacy participants with outdated business models.
We believe that key limitations of industry incumbents include: (i) commoditized products that are notoriously ill-fitting, uncomfortable and lacking in design and functionality; (ii) limited lifestyle offerings; (iii) brand obscurity and limited brand loyalty resulting from sales under third-party licenses and lack of control over the product; (iv) antiquated distribution through a fragmented network of discount brick-and-mortar medical supply stores; (v) lack of DTC distribution; (vi) lack of a direct connection with the end customer and; and (vii) structurally challenged margin profiles impacting incumbent manufacturers’ ability to invest in product innovation, marketing and customer experience.
 The Industry is Fundamentally Changing.
We believe the healthcare apparel sector is positioned for continued strong growth driven by several key industry dynamics. The healthcare apparel industry is growing and has demonstrated resilience across economic cycles, driven by the non-discretionary, replenishment nature of its products and the secular growth of the healthcare sector. Healthcare professions are also among the fastest growing occupations in the United States. With an expanding aging population, proliferation of chronic illness, greater access to healthcare in the United States and an increasing focus on health and wellness, the demand for healthcare professionals continues to

grow. Further, the shift to eCommerce is rapidly accelerating as consumers continue to embrace the convenience of online and mobile shopping. For healthcare professionals who work long shifts and all hours of the day and night, the convenience of eCommerce is even more necessary. Lastly, Consumers are increasingly attracted to, and interested in engaging with, purpose-driven brands using social media channels.
Supported by these key trends, the healthcare apparel industry is expected to demonstrate strong and consistent growth, with the total addressable market in the United States expected to grow by a 6.1% CAGR over the next five years, from approximately $12.0 billion in 2020 to approximately $16.0 billion in 2025, according to the Frost & Sullivan study.
 What Sets Us Apart
 We believe that the following competitive strengths have been key drivers of our success to date and strategically position us for continued success.
Deeply Passionate, Loyal Community
By December 31, 2021, our deeply loyal community consisted of approximately 1.9 million active customers. Our brand awareness is driven largely by word of mouth among healthcare professionals who are passionate about FIGS, and whose passion quickly spreads through hospitals and healthcare institutions, where thousands of healthcare professionals often work in close proximity to one another. In addition, through our digital platform and social media presence, we provide venues for our community to engage with each other on common ground. We are proud that our products and digital platform are connecting healthcare professionals and bridging gaps that previously existed across varying disciplines and experience levels.
Authentic, Category-Defining Brand
FIGS is the first digitally native lifestyle brand outfitting healthcare professionals. Our brand represents high quality, functional, comfortable and stylish products combined with a seamless digital customer experience. We are purpose-driven with a mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others, and this purpose resonates with our community. We collaborate with other highly regarded brands to further extend our brand reach and enhance our appeal with customers. Through our Ambassador Program, we have formed meaningful relationships with hundreds of Awesome Humans who help us reach millions of healthcare professionals around the world in an intimate, authentic and personalized way. Our strong brand affinity is demonstrated by our high Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) of +80 through December 31, 2021.
 Industry-Leading Product Innovation
We strive to create the most innovative, functional, comfortable and stylish healthcare apparel in the industry. Our design philosophy stems from an unwavering focus on what healthcare professionals need from their apparel in order to look, feel and perform at their best. Our innovative products are designed, sourced and manufactured from the fiber level. Our proprietary FIONx fabric technology is made from what we believe to be the best combination of materials and is core-spun for maximum durability to withstand the demands of a healthcare professional’s work without sacrificing comfort. We design products that offer technical features such as four-way stretch, anti-odor, anti-wrinkle, and moisture-wicking properties. Our approach and products are distinct from those of legacy manufacturers, who offer poorly fitting scrubs and other commoditized healthcare apparel offerings.
Digitally Native Direct-to-Consumer Strategy
Our business is powered by a digitally native DTC strategy, which offers significant competitive advantages and enables us to directly engage with and serve medical professionals. By owning all aspects of the customer experience, including website and app design, marketing content, storytelling and post-purchase customer engagement, we deliver an elevated, personalized and seamless experience. Our DTC strategy also gives us access to valuable real-time customer data that we leverage in all aspects of our business, including apparel design and merchandising, customer acquisition and retention, demand forecasting and inventory optimization, leading to operational efficiencies throughout our supply chain, inventory management and new product development.
  Highly Effective Merchandising and Product Launch Model
We have developed a highly effective merchandising strategy, anchored by our recurring, functional offering of 13 core scrubwear styles, which represented over 80% of our net revenues in 2021. We offer these core scrubwear styles in six core colors as well as limited edition colors to generate excitement around the brand and create a sense of purchase urgency. In addition to our core scrubwear styles, we offer scrubs in limited edition styles, which represented 5% of our net revenues in 2021. The remaining 14% of net revenues in 2021 was generated from sales of our lifestyle apparel and other non-scrub offerings, which include lab coats, underscrubs, outerwear, loungewear, compression socks, footwear, masks and other products. For our limited edition colors and styles, we utilize a disciplined buying approach with shallow initial buys and data-driven repurchasing decisions to minimize inventory risk while creating scarcity. We launch limited edition colors, limited edition styles or new products almost every week,

driving recurring traffic to our digital platform where customers often purchase limited edition products along with our core offerings. These launches not only drive interest in the limited edition products themselves, they also drive our core business. This innovative, lower-risk merchandising strategy drives recurring demand while maintaining inventory efficiency. As an additional benefit, our approach has resulted in a return rate of approximately 10% in 2020 and 2021, which is far lower than the broader online apparel return rates that tend to be in the 30% to 40% range.
Attractive Financial Profile Driving Robust Growth, Profitability and Cash Flow Generation
 Our business model supports our attractive financial profile characterized by robust growth, profitability and cash flow generation. As a successful DTC brand with a highly effective merchandising model, we benefit from structurally advantaged product margins. Through our DTC strategy, we leverage data in our marketing initiatives to drive efficient customer acquisition and retention, which has contributed to our rapid growth and strong profitability. In 2021, we delivered net revenues growth of 59.5%, gross margins of 71.8%, operating income margins of 2.6% and Adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.1%. Due to our modest capital expenditure requirements, we enjoy significant cash flow generation.
 Mission-Driven, Founder-Led Culture and Execution
Our company culture, strategic vision and operational execution are driven by our visionary co-founders and co-Chief Executive Officers, Heather Hasson and Trina Spear. Our company culture mirrors our founders’ mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others. We understand that authentically serving humans starts from within, and we are passionate about supporting our community and ensuring that our company reflects the world we want to live in. We are committed to operating responsibly and promoting ethical and sustainable business practices through our sourcing and manufacturing. We prioritize building a diverse, inclusive, equitable and supportive team that is driven by creativity and purposeful innovation.
Our Growth Strategies
In 2020, the total addressable market of the U.S. healthcare apparel industry was approximately $12.0 billion, according to the Frost & Sullivan study. Notwithstanding our rapid growth, we estimate that our share of this U.S. healthcare apparel industry is approximately 3.5%, presenting substantial opportunity for further growth. We believe we are well-positioned to significantly expand our market share and drive sustainable growth and profitability by executing on the following strategies:
Continue to Increase Customer Loyalty
 We have the opportunity to create customers for life—customers who return to FIGS repeatedly throughout their medical careers. Healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand. As a result, customer loyalty and retention will continue to be a key driver of our growth. We encourage repeat purchases by introducing innovative limited edition styles, products and color drops. Customers who we retain also tend to spend more with us over time. By leveraging data analytics and developing new personalization capabilities, we plan to continue to deepen our existing customer relationships to further improve our strong customer retention and engagement.
 We also inspire customer loyalty by building authentic relationships with our community and by creating thoughtful brand and performance marketing focused on retention. For example, through our #FIGSLOVE program, we send special gifts, such as embroidered lab coats, to members of our community when they graduate from school, open a new practice or reach other career milestones. We aim to be part of their journey, building deep, lasting relationships along the way.
Grow Brand Awareness and Attract New Customers
 As of December 31, 2021, we served a community of approximately 1.9 million active customers, which compares to a broader total addressable market of 20 million healthcare professionals in the United States. In addition, compared to the percentage of male healthcare professionals in the United States, our men’s business is proportionally underpenetrated, presenting significant opportunity to expand our customer base.
We also have a significant opportunity to grow brand awareness and attract new customers to FIGS through word of mouth, brand marketing and performance marketing. Hospitals and other healthcare institutions, which often employ thousands of healthcare professionals working in close physical proximity on a daily basis, serve as ideal environments for growing awareness of our brand through word of mouth. Brand marketing and performance marketing also work together to drive millions of visits to our digital platform. We create differentiated brand marketing content to grow and retain our loyal community while highlighting the spirit of the FIGS brand. We leverage authentic relationships with healthcare professionals who serve as Ambassadors by exhibiting outsized engagement with our community through social media. We complement social media efforts with offline brand marketing strategies, such as billboards and commercials, that deliver emotional and inspiring content that drive brand awareness. Our digital-centric performance marketing efforts are designed to drive customers from awareness to consideration to conversion. These efforts include retargeting, paid search and product listing advertisements, paid social media advertisements, search engine optimization, personalized email and mobile push notifications through our app. Our highly productive, diversified strategy generates a significant return on new

customer acquisition investments resulting from high average order value, strong product margins and attractive repeat purchase behavior.
Broaden Our Lifestyle Offerings
 We intend to continue to leverage healthcare professionals’ trust in our technical function, fit, comfort and style, as well as our rapid product development capabilities to broaden and deepen our product offerings. We have strategically expanded our addressable market over time by creating new innovative products and entering or creating new categories that are complementary to our core offerings. Our category expansion strategy is focused on outfitting the medical professional—on and off shift—to work, at work and from work. As a result, we created the FIGS Layering System, which features complementary products intentionally designed to be worn together from base layer to outer layer. Our customers often begin their FIGS journey with our core scrubs and expand their purchases to limited edition scrubs, lifestyle and other products that form a part of the FIGS Layering System. As we continue to expand our offerings to fully outfit the medical professional, we believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to expand our share of both the uniform and lifestyle wardrobe of our customers.
Pursue International Expansion
 We believe there is a tremendous opportunity over the long term to serve healthcare professionals throughout the rest of the world. According to the Frost & Sullivan study, the number of healthcare professionals and medical students internationally is expected to grow from approximately 118 million in 2020 to an estimated 124 million in 2025, and the total addressable market for healthcare apparel outside of the U.S. is expected to grow from an estimated $67.0 billion in 2020 to an estimated $86.0 billion in 2025.
Outside of the United States, we currently sell into Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Customer reception to date in these markets has been strong and has proven that our brand resonates with customers outside of the United States. Over time, we plan to enter other new markets. We intend to make strategic investments in these markets as we seek to enhance our ability to serve our international customers and further establish FIGS as a global brand.
Utilize Data Science to Expand Our Community, Elevate Customer Experience and Drive Intelligent Replenishment
 We expect to drive continued growth from our use of proprietary data science. Through hundreds of data attributes associated with millions of customers, we have a unique ability to welcome new healthcare professionals to our community and drive repeat business from them. As just one illustration of this, we are able to identify geographic regions where FIGS is under-represented, use our knowledge of existing community members to build machine learning-derived customer segments to identify who is most likely to purchase from us, and drive our customers to a digital experience that is pre-populated with the products most likely to appeal to them.
Similarly, we believe that traditional fixed-time subscription models do not sufficiently leverage data and thus are disconnected from a healthcare professional’s actual needs. Instead, we use an intelligent replenishment model that is tied to individualized buying preferences. To us, it is fundamental that we cater to the unique preferences of each healthcare professional—how often they want to buy certain products, which products they are most likely to buy, and through which channel they are most likely to transact. By leveraging data science, we are able to answer these questions for each member of our large and growing community in increasingly accurate ways, and to create replenishment opportunities that are tied to those customized needs. Using data science to make the buying experience as seamless and accommodating as possible is a fundamental part of the value we create for our community and we believe will drive continued growth for our business.
Enter New Professional Markets
 Outside of the healthcare apparel industry, we believe we have a compelling long-term opportunity to enter into other uniform-wearing professional markets. In the United States, there are approximately 40 million people outside of healthcare in service-based industries that traditionally wear uniforms every day, such as food service, hospitality, construction and transportation. The occupational nature of these professions is generally hands-on, labor-intensive and often requires apparel with technical specifications. Furthermore, we believe the incumbent apparel manufacturers in these markets suffer from limitations similar to those faced by the legacy healthcare apparel manufacturers. In our view, these markets—similar to the healthcare apparel market—have long been underserved by incumbent apparel manufacturers and are ripe for disruption. We believe we are strategically positioned to leverage our core competencies to expand into these new markets in the future.
Our Products
We approach product design with the healthcare professional in mind. With an intimate understanding of how medical professionals move, work and interact with colleagues and patients, we seek to design products that solve their unique needs. We are constantly challenging ourselves to create the highest quality and most innovative fabrications, styles and product features for healthcare professionals. Our apparel is comfortable, durable, functional and stylish, all at an affordable price point. As a result of our efforts, healthcare professionals now have a destination to outfit themselves with products that allow them to look, feel and perform at their best.
We Believe in Continuous Innovation
The needs of healthcare professionals are always changing, and we aim to understand and address their needs through direct interactions with our community. We leverage customer data, customer feedback, focus groups and practitioner testing to understand how to best serve healthcare professionals. Our tight feedback loop through our digital platform and social media channels, as well as our customer experience team, enables us to quickly incorporate ideas from our community into our product design.
 •Fabric Innovation for Comfort and Performance. Our core FIONx fabric is extremely soft and features antimicrobial technology for odor control and fabric durability, four-way stretch to allow for greater mobility, moisture-wicking properties to assist with body temperature regulation and anti-wrinkle for extra convenience.
 •Functional Innovation. Our scrubs have a large number of specially designed pockets to comfortably hold professional equipment, such as stethoscopes, tablets, charts, dental loupes and flushes. They also include bungee loops for security badges and other pockets for personal belongings, such as keys, phones, wallets and rings.
 •Fit Innovation. Our technical design team ensures our products are tailored to provide optimal fit, comfort and mobility. In addition, we believe in fit inclusivity and strive to outfit every healthcare professional. Accordingly, we offer seven sizes for women (XXS-2XL), six sizes for men (XS-2XL), three lengths for women (petite, regular, tall) and three lengths for men (short, regular, tall). We also offer various maternity offerings. 
 •Style Innovation. We believe that healthcare professionals have the right to be stylish and look good while wearing their uniform. Our design and apparel team is comprised of experts from throughout the technical fashion world, ensuring that our products have a sophisticated silhouette in addition to being comfortable, high-performing and functional. 
 Product Offerings
Healthcare professionals change environments frequently and need comfortable high-quality products that help them do their jobs in every situation they face. That’s why we approach our products as a complete layering system—the FIGS Layering System—which includes what healthcare professionals wear under their scrubs (such as underscrubs, sports bras and leggings), the scrubs themselves, and what they wear over their scrubs (such as vests, jackets and fleeces).
 There are two primary categories within the FIGS Layering System: scrubwear and non-scrubwear/lifestyle.
•Scrubwear. We redefined scrubs, engineering them for function and taking cues from performance sports apparel, to create exceptionally comfortable and technical products to help healthcare professionals look good, feel good and perform at their best. Within the scrubwear category, we have 13 core styles that are available on our digital platform year-round. These core scrubwear styles consist of three women’s scrub tops, four women’s scrub pants, three men’s scrub tops and three men’s scrub pants. We offer these core styles in six core colors and in limited edition colors. Additionally, we frequently launch limited edition scrubwear styles in both core and limited edition colors.
 •Non-Scrubwear/Lifestyle. Our non-scrubwear and lifestyle product offerings are intentionally designed as an integrated system that complements our scrubwear. These products are comprised of “base layer” and “outer layer” products:
 oBase layer products are those designed to be worn under scrubs, and include compression socks and underscrubs. Our underscrubs include sports bras, performance leggings and tops and super-soft pima cotton tops. 
 oOuter layer products include footwear, vests, jackets and lab coats. We partner with New Balance to design and offer shoes that provide greater slip-resistance, cushion and moisture-repellent qualities that our healthcare professionals need. We also offer necessities such as face masks, scrub caps, lanyards, badge reels, tote bags, fanny packs, backpacks, baseball caps and beanies. 
 We also offer kits, which feature various assortments of our products bundled together and which are a convenient way for our Awesome Humans to purchase products from across the FIGS Layering System with one click.
 Our Community of Awesome Humans
We strive to celebrate, empower and serve healthcare professionals across all levels of experience and areas of expertise. While there is considerable diversity in demographics and income levels within the healthcare sector, we attract a diverse range of healthcare professionals by having a differentiated brand and offering premium products at an affordable price point.
Our customers included a wide range of experience levels and areas of expertise, including registered nurses, nurse practitioners, orthodontists, dental hygienists, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, veterinarians, sales representatives, estheticians, speech pathologists, emergency medical technicians, surgeons and healthcare administrators, among others. Due to the

high proportion of our customer mix that is comprised of students and young professionals whose earnings will grow over the course of their careers, we believe we are well positioned to retain and increase engagement of these customers, expanding our share of their uniform and lifestyle wardrobe over time.
 Our Marketing Strategy
We create differentiated brand marketing content and utilize performance marketing to drive customers from awareness to consideration to conversion. Our fluidity in brand and performance marketing has led to the creation of a brand characterized by stickiness and high purchase frequency.
 Brand Marketing
We attract and retain customers in large part through our unique ability to engage with our community, which we do across multiple channels, including marketing campaigns, social media and our Ambassador Program.
Marketing campaigns. Most of our creative assets are created in-house, allowing us to launch campaigns at an accelerated pace to celebrate the products we bring to market and the people who will wear them. We launch fully integrated marketing campaigns that feature Awesome Humans in larger-than-life scenarios, bringing the people, their profession and our brand to life. Campaigns are launched through a holistic, multi-media strategy, where hero messaging and imagery are woven through every platform, including email, digital, display, site, direct-mail, commercials, social media and Ambassadors. We believe our campaigns and inspiring messaging contribute to high brand affinity among our community.
Social Media. We were the first healthcare apparel company to have a significant presence on social media. We use social media to foster a dialogue with our community and grow an enthusiastic, highly engaged fan base. Today, we have nearly 700,000 followers on Instagram, which is over twice the number of followers of our nearest competitor. We are proud of our robust following and above-average engagement rate. Social media is the primary place for our community to congregate, share stories, follow product launches and interact with our brand, and in turn, our community shares feedback that informs our product and content decisions. We strive to create content that has value and purpose—whether to amplify a cause, make people laugh, or to celebrate and educate about our product—and social media is where our creativity and deep connection to our community meet.
Our Ambassador Program. FIGS is the first company to have brand ambassadors in the healthcare apparel industry, providing a platform for healthcare professionals to tell their stories. Our Ambassador Program consists of Awesome Humans from around the world, representing a diverse array of specialties and levels of experience across various professions and geographies. We have formed deep and meaningful relationships with our Ambassadors and their loyalty, love and involvement with our brand fosters organic sharing, storytelling and intimate connections with the millions of healthcare professionals in our community. Our Ambassador Program is a microcosm of our FIGS community—they are invaluable to us, they inspire and inform everything we do, and we would not be where we are today without them.
Performance Marketing
Our performance marketing is rooted in a digital centric approach that aims to offer the right products to the right healthcare professionals at the right times. Our sophisticated performance marketing efforts include retargeting, paid search and product listing advertisements, paid social media advertisements, search engine optimization, personalized email and mobile push notifications through our app. When combined with our community-driven brand marketing, our performance marketing supports attractive customer acquisition and retention metrics. Because we can pinpoint specifically who our customers are and where they live and work, we are able to target them with greater efficiency and less expense than other companies whose customers come from a much less defined group.
Our Teams Business
 We have built a differentiated B2B custom platform, known as Teams, to revolutionize, consumerize and elevate what had previously been an outdated buying process for institutional customers. Through Teams, healthcare administrators can seamlessly and efficiently solicit individual orders and buy FIGS products for their teams with only a few clicks. Our Teams business is centered around partnering with institutional departments and medical offices that wish to standardize and professionalize their teams’ uniforms.
Our Data Analytics
 Data is an essential and embedded capability throughout our organization. We have teams of data scientists, data engineers and data analysts working directly with each key functional area. This approach enables the harvesting and management of extensive data, the development of a suite of proprietary tools, and the direct and rapid application of data science in core operating activities and decision-making processes throughout the Company.
The scale of our data is vast and growing. Our rich data set is blended from first-party, deterministic and observed behaviors, a complementary, expanded set of enriched elements and hundreds of data attributes associated with millions of customers. In addition,

we have established a unique approach to capturing granular data from all stages of the order journey. These data sets are used to build proprietary data science solutions applied to key functions across the company, including:
 •Product. We develop detailed pictures of our customers and use these personas to shape our unique understanding of them and to inform our product development. Through our models, we gain powerful insights into factors that are most likely to drive conversion, and we use those inferences as inputs into the product design and development process. 
 •Supply Chain. We have built a proprietary integration for our product lifecycle from purchase order to manufacturing to shipping. This integration enables extensive management and oversight of the product flow and fuels a variety of prediction models. By combining the product lifecycle data integration with sophisticated demand predictions, we can continuously assess the supply chain and improve efficiency. 
 •Merchandising and Inventory Management. Through our customer ontology, we develop precisely defined customer segments and a mosaic representation of our customers. This approach enables us to understand buying behaviors, preferred DTC channels, product preferences and decision drivers. It also enables us to manage purchasing and inventory effectively and efficiently. We also use data-driven models to predict demand for our products. The high concentration of core scrubwear sales enables our models to be highly predictive, which reliably extends to limited edition launches, and we are able to anticipate optimal times for launch, including day of week and time of day. 
 •Marketing. We use our customer ontology to create customized segments that can be launched efficiently across media channels. This precise segmentation supports highly tailored messaging and lower costs per impression. We employ a suite of dynamic learning tools to understand creative performance and behavior at the customer segment level. These tools enable us to effectively develop and place our creative assets. Combining our micro-segments and creative optimization enables us to create finely tuned campaigns that allow us to reach our target audiences with creative assets that we believe have the highest probability of driving conversion. 
 •Customer Experience. The integration of our customer ontology and predictions into the engineering of our DTC channels enables customized customer experiences. For example, we use customized email and SMS communication to deliver personalized recommendations and offers that are more likely to drive conversion. We continue to evolve the site experience to support tuned recommendations based on prediction models and to offer product bundles based on cluster analysis. Using our customer data, we make individual customer level predictions leading to direct and tailored outreach with messaging that has a higher probability of individualized success. As such, we can provide a high-quality customer experience by presenting products that our healthcare professionals need, exactly when they need them. 
 Our Technology
In addition to our use of data analytics, we internally develop custom, proprietary technology solutions where doing so would be a true differentiator and core to the unique needs of our community, and we otherwise leverage best-of-breed, third-party components and software to help build out our platform capabilities. Consistent with this philosophy, we created our own headless digital platform, which is a fully customized front-end architecture that allows our community of healthcare professionals to experience features and functionality that are specifically tailored to their needs. We then combine that customized presentation layer with the backend engine from Shopify, which is a proven and industry-leading e-commerce solution. By pairing our own in-house technology with cloud software, we have been able to create a truly differentiated user experience that we can adjust as necessary while also leveraging engineering talent from some of the best SAAS companies in the world to scale rapidly and efficiently.
Our Supply Chain
We have built a supply chain that is optimized for our business and through which we control the design, development and fulfillment of our products.
Manufacturing
 We have a diversified and flexible supply chain that leverages third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our raw materials and finished products. We directly and actively manage every step of our product development and production process. The extent to which we manage production is differentiated from the typical model of primarily relying on third-party agents to manage production. We believe our approach has enabled us to produce premium products through greater control of the end-to-end production process.
Our in-house innovation and design team works closely with our suppliers to develop the materials for our products that meet our exact specifications for comfort, stretch, durability, functionality and performance. In 2021, nearly 90% of our production utilized

our main scrubwear fabric technology FIONx, which enables us to achieve consistency and scale. Our in-house production team selects our fabric and trim suppliers, directly manages the relationships between these suppliers and our finished product manufacturers, and drives our production allocation strategy and production schedules.
The 13 core scrubwear styles that we produce year-round represented over 80% of our net revenues in 2021. Similar to our core FIONx fabric, the continuous production of our core scrubwear styles provides us with consistency and scale in our production. We manage a diversified supply chain, which spanned 14 countries and consisted of approximately 40 global production partners in 2021.
 As a company devoted to the needs of healthcare professionals, quality is critically important to us. We have our own in-house quality control team and also independent third-party quality controllers that each conduct detailed quality control checks on our fabric, trims and finished products to ensure that our extremely high quality standards are met. We maintain stringent Acceptable Quality Limit standards, which define the level of quality required to pass our inspection processes.
We purchase our finished product from our manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any supplier or manufacturer. We have long-standing relationships with our vendors, which are strengthened by the consistency and longevity of our core fabric and core style profile. Further, we offer our manufacturing partners predictable and consistent growth in inventory purchases with little seasonality.
We regularly source new suppliers and manufacturers to support our ongoing innovation and growth, particularly in our non-scrub categories, and we carefully evaluate all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share our standards for quality of manufacturing, ethical working conditions and social and environmental sustainability practices. As part of our quality assurance procedures, FIGS team members visit all direct FIGS suppliers on average two times each month, and they visit all of our suppliers’ suppliers on average one time each month, to review their operations and our quality requirements.
In line with our values, we also require all of our manufacturers to be certified through the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”) program, which is an independent organization dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing. Furthermore, we require all suppliers and manufacturers to contractually commit to upholding these standards. As part of our suppliers’ required certification with WRAP, they undergo regular audits by WRAP directly. WRAP awards Gold certifications to facilities that demonstrate full compliance with WRAP’s 12 principles, and WRAP awards Platinum certifications to facilities that have demonstrated full compliance with WRAP’s 12 principles for three consecutive certification audits. Platinum facilities must successfully pass every audit with no corrective actions or observations and maintain continuous certification without gaps. All FIGS suppliers must have a Gold or Platinum certification in order to continue to work with us.
Warehouse and Embroidery
We ship our finished products to customers across the United States as well as internationally to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. We distribute our products from our fulfillment center located in City of Industry, California, where we have created an innovative warehouse-within-a-warehouse model at our third-party logistics provider’s site. Within this space, we also operate a technology-enabled embroidery workshop, through which we offer text and logo embroidery on scrub tops, lab coats and outerwear, enabling our healthcare professionals to tell the world who they are and what they do. Our embroidery workshop is fully staffed by FIGS embroidery team members who complete the application and quality control of our embroidery product. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and capacity to ensure that we are able to meet our anticipated needs and support our continued growth.
Our People and Human Capital
 As a company whose mission is to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others, we understand that authentically serving humans starts from within. At FIGS, we are creating the world we want to live in, and we work hard to ensure that our company reflects what we want to see in our community.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 264 team members in the United States across our Santa Monica, California headquarters, our City of Industry, California fulfillment center location and remote locations. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce from time to time. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees to continue to bolster functions across the Company, including design, innovation, engineering and functions related to our operations as a publicly traded company, as well as other functions, to support our expected growth. We pride ourselves on hiring team members who not only have the skills required to perform their respective roles, but also share in the mission to celebrate, empower and serve those who serve others.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We prioritize building a diverse, inclusive, equitable, and empowered team representing a mix of gender, racial and ethnic backgrounds, industries, and levels of experience. Based on data collected between December 2021 and January 2022, we are proud that:


•60% of our board of directors identified as women and 20% identified as underrepresented minorities;
 •64% of our leadership team identified as women, 9% identified as agender and 30% identified as underrepresented minorities; and
 •69% of our total workforce identified as women, 2% identified as non-binary, 1% identified as genderqueer or genderfluid, 1% identified as agender and 61% identified as underrepresented minorities.
 Compensation and Benefits
 We offer highly competitive compensation and benefits designed to enable us to attract, retain and motivate exceptional talent. Our 2021 equity incentive award plan additionally provides for grants of equity awards to employees. We are proud that we grant all new hires equity as part of their total compensation package, which we believe fosters a stronger sense of ownership and aligns our employees’ interests with the interests and growth of the Company.
In addition to base compensation and awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plan, we offer numerous benefits, including a 401(k) plan with matching, health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, life insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, a referral bonus program and company-sponsored short term and long term disability. To drive further engagement and individual ownership of the Company, we also maintain an employee stock purchase plan, which provides eligible employees an opportunity to purchase additional FIGS stock at a discounted price.
Culture and Perks
 We believe that to be successful, each of our employees must feel empowered to show up as their true authentic selves. As we continue to grow, we are proactive in ensuring that every single person at FIGS has a platform to be seen, heard and celebrated. To accomplish this goal, we are intensely focused on our culture, team-building initiatives and well-being. Our Culture Committee strives to foster an empowering, supportive and healthy experience for all FIGS employees and helps ensure that all FIGS voices are represented and heard, by routinely organizing Company-wide events and initiatives. We also offer our employees several well-being perks, including food delivery stipends, and access to virtual workouts, mental health, behavioral health, therapy and self-care providers.
 Safety
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. The core elements of our employee health and safety strategy are risk analysis, incident management, documented processes and training, including for our team members at our fulfillment center. We also maintain a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report health and safety risks. We continually strive to improve our safety processes. During fiscal year 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also continued to implement safety protocols to protect our employees, including protocols regarding social distancing and face coverings, temperature checks and testing. In addition, the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely.
Competition
 Competition in the healthcare apparel industry is principally on the basis of product quality, innovation, style, price, brand image, distribution model, as well as customer experience and service. We believe we have competitive advantages from our technical product innovation, our focus on empowering the community of healthcare professionals, and our high quality brand image. In addition, we believe our digitally native DTC distribution strategy differentiates us from the industry incumbents and allows us to establish personal customer relationships and more effectively support healthcare professionals. We are also differentiated by our commitment to community-based marketing that increases brand awareness and strengthens customer loyalty.
 The healthcare apparel industry includes established companies as well as new entrants. We compete against wholesalers of healthcare apparel, such as Careismatic Brands, Barco Uniforms, Landau Uniforms and Superior Group of Companies. Additionally, we compete with healthcare apparel aggregated retailers, such as Scrubs & Beyond and Uniform Advantage, as well as DTC brands such as Jaanuu.
 Government Regulation
 In the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, safety regulations, product labeling regulations, product safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of fulfillment centers and privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the ePrivacy Directive and national implementing and supplementing laws in the European Economic Area. Our products sold outside of the United States may be subject to tariffs, treaties and various trade agreements, as well as laws affecting the importation of consumer goods.

We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. While compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of employees, as well as financial resources, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compliance with these laws and regulations, including any applicable environmental regulations, has not had, and in any material subsequent period is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 Intellectual Property
 To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions in license agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contracts. Our intellectual property is an important component of our business, and we believe that our know-how and continuing innovation are important to developing and maintaining our competitive position. We also believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable on our products is an important factor in continuing to build our brand and distinguish our products. We consider the FIGS name and Cross & Shield Logo trademarks to be among our most valuable intellectual property assets. In addition, we have applied to register or have registered the trademarks for several of our fabrics and product names, and have also sought and/or obtained trademark registrations for several of our tag lines.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned nine U.S. trademark registrations, had 12 pending U.S. trademark applications, owned 69 foreign trademark registrations and had 23 pending foreign trademark applications.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had two allowed U.S. design patents, ten U.S. design patent applications pending, 52 granted foreign design registrations and 12 pending foreign design registrations, each of which relates to our core scrubwear. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we also had an additional four U.S. design patent applications pending, five granted foreign design registrations, and ten pending foreign design applications for other apparel designs. The term of protection for design patents and design registrations is limited in duration and depends on the jurisdiction in which they are granted. Although our U.S. design patent applications have not yet issued, the term for any resulting issued design patents in the U.S. generally extends 15 years from the date of patent grant.
If the foreign design registrations issued to us for our core scrubwear are maintained until the end of their terms, they are expected to expire in 2025, at which point we intend to renew them, to the extent they are renewable. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
