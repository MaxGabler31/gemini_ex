Item 1. Business
GENERAL
 
PhenixFIN Corporation (“PhenixFIN”, the “Company,” “we” and “us”) is an internally-managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company incorporated in Delaware that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) and commenced operations on January 20, 2011. The Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). On November 18, 2020, the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved the adoption of an internalized management structure, effective January 1, 2021. Until close of business on December 31, 2020 we were externally managed and advised by MCC Advisors LLC (“MCC Advisors”), pursuant to an investment management agreement. MCC Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of Medley LLC, which is controlled by Medley Management Inc. (NYSE: MDLY), a publicly traded asset management firm (“MDLY”), which in turn is controlled by Medley Group LLC, an entity wholly owned by the senior professionals of Medley LLC. We use the term “Medley” to refer collectively to the activities and operations of Medley Capital LLC, Medley LLC, MDLY, Medley Group LLC, MCC Advisors, associated investment funds and their respective affiliates herein. Since January 1, 2021 the Company has been managed pursuant to an internalized management structure.
 
The Company has formed and expects to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries (the “Taxable Subsidiaries”), which are taxed as corporations for federal income tax purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow us to, among other things, hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a RIC under the Code.
 
The Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. The management team seeks to achieve this objective primarily through making loans, private equity or other investments in privately-held companies. The Company may also make debt, equity or other investments in publicly-traded companies. (These investments may also include investments in other BDCs, closed-end funds or real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).) We may also pursue other strategic opportunities and invest in other assets or operate other businesses to achieve our investment objective, such as operating and managing an asset-based lending business. The portfolio generally consists of senior secured first lien term loans, senior secured second lien term loans, senior secured bonds, preferred equity and common equity. Occasionally, we will receive warrants or other equity participation features which we believe will have the potential to increase total investment returns. Our loan and other debt investments are primarily rated below investment grade or are unrated. Investments in below investment grade securities are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due.
 
We believe the private debt market is undergoing structural shifts that are creating significant opportunities for non-bank lenders and investors. The underlying drivers of these structural changes include reduced participation by banks in the private debt markets and demand for private debt created by committed and uninvested private equity capital. We focus on taking advantage of this structural shift by lending directly to companies that are underserved by the traditional banking system and generally seek to avoid broadly marketed investment opportunities. We source investment opportunities primarily through direct relationships with financial sponsors, industry specialists, as well as financial intermediaries such as investment banks and commercial banks.
 
Our Investment Team is responsible for sourcing investment opportunities, conducting industry research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Our Investment Team draws on its expertise in lending to predominantly privately held borrowers in a range of sectors, including industrials, transportation, energy and natural resources, financials, gemstones/jewelry and real estate.
 
As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or 150% if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met) after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.
 
As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s asset coverage was 255.0% after giving effect to leverage and therefore the Company’s asset coverage was greater than 200%, the minimum asset coverage requirement applicable presently to the Company under the 1940 Act.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 445 Park Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, NY and our telephone number is (212) 859-0390.

Investment Process Overview
 
Sourcing and Origination. We typically source investment opportunities through our management team’s network of long-standing relationships. Our sourcing efforts are led by our senior investment professionals, who leverage their experience in the sourcing and origination of investments.
Initial Evaluation. We use a systematic, consistent approach to credit evaluation, which typically consists of (i) a preliminary due diligence review conducted by the Company, (ii) an initial diligence meeting with the Company’s management team, investment bank or private equity sponsor, (iii) an initial indication of interest and terms, and (iv) preparation of memoranda including potential portfolio company overviews, investment considerations and risks, financial model and return information.
Due Diligence & Underwriting. We typically undertake continued diligence, which expands on the investment thesis, risks and mitigants, and competition factors of our potential investment opportunities. We may conduct third party reviews, on-site visits and/or background checks in connection with our potential investments in portfolio companies.
Portfolio Management. We undertake a proactive monitoring process of our portfolio companies, whereby we conduct monthly financial review and monitoring of covenants, maintain ongoing dialogue with portfolio company management and owners, and exercise board observer rights where appropriate.
Rating Criteria We generally use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:

Credit | 
-------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rating | Definition 
1 | Investments that are performing above expectations. 
2 | Investments that are performing within expectations, with risks that are neutral or favorable compared to risks at the time of origination. All new loans are rated ’2’. 
3 | Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of interest, dividend or principal is expected. Companies rated ’3’ may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, loan payments are generally not past due. 
4 | Investments that are performing below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination. Some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).
5 | Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Some loss of principal is expected. 

Investment Structure
 
Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers to structure an investment. We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure.
 
We typically structure our debt investments as follows:
 
Senior Secured First Lien Term Loans We structure these investments as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company borrower. Our senior secured loans may provide for amortization of principal with the majority of the amortization due at maturity.

Senior Secured Second Lien Term Loans We structure these investments as junior, secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serves as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of second-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. These loans typically provide for amortization of principal in the initial years of the loans, with the majority of the amortization due at maturity.
Senior Secured First Lien Notes We structure these investments as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind, or (“PIK”) interest), with amortization of principal due at maturity. PIK interest represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term and recorded as interest income on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected.
Warrants and Minority Equity Securities In some cases, we may also receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy a minority equity interest in the portfolio company in connection with a debt investment. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.
Unitranche Loans We structure our unitranche loans, which combine the characteristics of traditional senior secured first lien term loans and subordinated notes as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral generally takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. Unitranche loans typically provide for amortization of principal in the initial years of the loans, with the majority of the amortization due at maturity.
Unsecured Debt We structure these investments as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind, or PIK interest), with amortization of principal due at maturity. Subordinated notes generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Subordinated notes are generally more volatile than secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal. Subordinated notes often include a PIK feature, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal.
 
We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may realize or sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale or recapitalization transaction, or the worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.
 
The Company has invested in its affiliate, FlexFIN, LLC (“FlexFIN”), which operates an asset-based lending business under which it enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with borrowers engaged in the gemstone/jewelry industry. FlexFIN will generally structure these loans as sale/repurchase transactions under which the collateral (that is, the gemstones/jewelry) remains under FlexFIN’s ownership during the entire term of the loan.
 
Managerial Assistance
 
As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may receive fees for these services.
Leverage
 
As a BDC, we are generally only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. We are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see “Regulation - Senior Securities.”
 
We may, from time to time, seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Competition
 
Our primary competitors to provide financing to private companies are public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, other BDCs, SBICs and private equity and hedge funds. Some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our favorable RIC tax treatment.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of September 30, 2022, the internalized management team consists of 3 investment professionals and 6 employees/consultants overall. This team includes our executive officers, investment and finance professionals, and administrative staff. Our senior management team consists of David Lorber, our chief executive officer, and Ellida McMillan, our chief financial officer.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted a temporary hybrid work-from-home policy, pursuant to which our professional team has and continues to primarily work remotely without disruption to our operations.
 
As an internally managed BDC, the success of our business and investment strategy, including achieving our investment objective, depends in material part on our professional team. We depend upon the members of our management team and our investment professionals for the identification, final selection, structuring, closing and monitoring of our investments. Our professional team has critical experience and relationships on which we rely to implement our business plan. We expect that the members of our management team and our investment professionals will maintain key informal relationships, which we will use to help identify and gain access to investment opportunities. If we do not attract, develop and retain highly talented professionals, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect and our operating results could be adversely affected. See “Item 1A, Risk Factors.”
 
Administration
 
We previously entered into (on January 11, 2011) and, prior to January 1, 2021, operated pursuant to an investment management agreement with MCC Advisors (the “Investment Management Agreement”) in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Management Agreement became effective upon the pricing of our initial public offering. Under the Investment Management Agreement, MCC Advisors agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we agreed to pay a base management fee equal to a percentage of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. The Investment Management Agreement expired December 31, 2020 and effective January 1, 2021, we operate pursuant to an internalized management structure.
 
We also entered into an administration agreement with MCC Advisors as our administrator on January 19, 2011. The administration agreement became effective upon the pricing of our initial public offering. Under the administration agreement, MCC Advisors agreed to furnish us with office facilities and equipment, provide us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provide us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. MCC Advisors also provided on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. The administration agreement expired at the close of business on December 31, 2020, in connection with the Company’s adoption of an internalized management structure. In connection with the adoption by the board of directors of an internalized management structure, on November 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Fund Accounting Servicing Agreement and an Administration Servicing Agreement on customary terms with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC d/b/a U.S. Bank Global Fund Services (“U.S. Bancorp”). A U.S. Bancorp affiliate also served as the Company’s custodian. The Company’s administrative and custodial relationship with U.S. Bancorp terminated on August 9, 2022. SS&C Technologies, Inc. (“SS&C”) has since served as administrator of the Company and has provided us with fund accounting and financial reporting services pursuant to its Services Agreement with the Company. Effective September 12, 2022, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“Computershare”) serves as custodian for the Company pursuant to its Loan Administration and Custodial Agreement with the Company.


Termination of Management Agreement and Merger Agreement
 
We entered into an investment management agreement with MCC Advisors on January 11, 2011 (the “Investment Management Agreement”), which expired December 31, 2020.
 
Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, MCC Advisors:
 

● | determined the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4

 


● | identified, evaluated and negotiated the structure of the investments we made (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | executed, closed, monitored and administered the investments we made, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
MCC Advisors’ services under the Investment Management Agreement were not exclusive, and it was free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us were not impaired.
 
Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, we paid MCC Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee.
 
On December 3, 2015, MCC Advisors recommended and, in consultation with the Board, agreed to reduce fees under the Investment Management Agreement. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee was reduced to 1.50% on gross assets above $1 billion. In addition, MCC Advisors reduced its incentive fee from 20% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over an 8% hurdle, to 17.5% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over a 6% hurdle. Moreover, the revised incentive fee includes a netting mechanism and is subject to a rolling three-year look back from January 1, 2016 forward. Under no circumstances would the new fee structure result in higher fees to MCC Advisors than fees under the prior investment management agreement.
 
The following discussion of our base management fee and two-part incentive fee reflect the terms of the fee waiver agreement executed by MCC Advisors on February 8, 2016 (the “Fee Waiver Agreement”). The terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement were effective as of January 1, 2016, and were a permanent reduction in the base management fee and incentive fee on net investment income payable to MCC Advisors for the investment advisory and management services it provided under the Investment Management Agreement. The Fee Waiver Agreement did not change the second component of the incentive fee, which was the incentive fee on capital gains.
 
On January 15, 2020, the Company’s board of directors, including all of the independent directors, approved the renewal of the Investment Management Agreement through the later of April 1, 2020 or so long as the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”), by and between the Company and Sierra (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”) was in effect, but no longer than a year; provided that, if the Amended MCC Merger Agreement is terminated by Sierra, then the termination of the Investment Management Agreement would be effective on the 30th day following receipt of Sierra’s notice of termination to the Company. On May 1, 2020, the Company received a notice of termination of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement from Sierra. Under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, either party was permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the Amended MCC Merger Agreement if the merger was not consummated by March 31, 2020. Sierra elected to do so on May 1, 2020. As result of the termination by Sierra of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement on May 1, 2020, the Investment Management Agreement would have been terminated effective as of May 31, 2020. On May 21, 2020, the Board, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Investment Management Agreement through the end of the then-current quarter, June 30, 2020. On June 12, 2020, the Board, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Investment Management Agreement through September 30, 2020. On September 29, the Board, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Investment Management Agreement through December 31, 2020. Mr. Brook Taube, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2020 and director through January 21, 2021 and Mr. Seth Taube, director through January 21, 2021 are affiliated with MCC Advisors and Medley.
 
On November 18, 2020, the Board approved the adoption of an internalized management structure effective January 1, 2021. The new management structure replaces the current Investment Management and Administration Agreements with MCC Advisors LLC, which expired on December 31, 2020. To lead the internalized management team, the Board approved the appointment of David Lorber, who has served as an independent director of the Company since April 2019, as Chief Executive Officer, and Ellida McMillan as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each effective January 1, 2021. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Lorber stepped down from the Compensation Committee of the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, and the Special Committee of the Board.

Summary of Risk Factors
 
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, including, but not limited to, the following risks:
 
Risks Related to our Business
 

● | We have determined to internalize our operating structure, including our management and investment functions, with the expectation that we will be able to operate more efficiently with lower costs, but this may not be the case.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As an internally managed BDC, we are dependent upon our management team and other professionals and if we are not able to hire and retain qualified personnel, we will not realize the anticipated benefits of the internalization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may suffer credit and capital losses.
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Because we use borrowed funds to make investments or fund our business operations, we are exposed to risks typically associated with leverage which increase the risk of investing in us.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A substantial portion of our portfolio investments will be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our valuation designee under the oversight of our board of directors and, as a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the value of our portfolio investments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates will be restricted, which may limit the scope of investments available to us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will be exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes relating to the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) calculation process may adversely affect the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because we use debt to finance our investments, changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If our investments are not managed effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may experience fluctuations in our periodic operating results.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not be able to pay you distributions and our distributions may not grow over time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The highly competitive market in which we operate may limit our investment opportunities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because we expect to distribute substantially all of our net investment income and net realized capital gains to our stockholders, we will need additional capital to finance our growth and such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our board of directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our management team may, from time to time, possess material non-public information, limiting our investment discretion. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6

 


● | Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us will be magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A failure of cybersecurity systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities class actions and derivative lawsuits, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Risks Related to our Investments
 

● | We may not realize gains from our equity investments.
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Our investments are very risky and highly speculative.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Our investments in private portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our portfolio companies may prepay loans, which prepayment may reduce stated yields if capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may acquire indirect interests in loans rather than direct interests, which would subject us to additional risk. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio and our ability to make follow-on investments in certain portfolio companies may be restricted. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to invest in public companies may be limited in certain circumstances. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hedging transactions may expose us to additional risks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | We may invest in “unitranche” debt instruments that combine both senior and subordinated debt into one debt instrument. Unitranche debt instruments typically pay a higher rate of interest than traditional senior debt instruments, but may also pose greater risk associated with a lesser amount of asset coverage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may invest in, or obtain exposure to, obligations that may be “covenant-lite,” which means such obligations lack certain financial maintenance covenants. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we invest in the securities and obligations of distressed and bankrupt issuers, we might not receive interest or other payments. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We may be subject to risks associated with significant investments in one or more economic sectors and/or industries, including the business services sector, which includes our investment in our affiliate’s asset-based lending business. 

 
 Risks Related to our Operations as a BDC and a RIC
 

● | Regulations governing our operation as a BDC may limit our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes in the laws or regulations governing our business, or changes in the interpretations thereof, and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We cannot predict how tax reform legislation will affect the Company, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a BDC, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code or satisfy RIC distribution requirements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Risks Relating to an Investment in our Securities
 

● | Investing in our securities may involve an above average degree of risk. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shares of closed-end investment companies, including business development companies, may, as is currently the case with the Company, at times, trade at a discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The NAV per share of our common stock may be diluted if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock or securities to subscribe for or convertible into shares of our common stock. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our 6.125% Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”) are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of September 30, 2022, our income-bearing investment portfolio, which represented 62.0% of our total portfolio, had a weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments of approximately 4.9%, and 81.9% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), while 18.1% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest at fixed rates. As of September 30, 2021, our income-bearing investment portfolio, which represented 86.6% of our total portfolio, had a weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments of approximately 6.75%, and 74.6% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, while 25.4% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest at fixed rates. The weighted average yield of our total portfolio does not represent the total return to our stockholders. The weighted average yield on income producing investments is computed based upon a combination of the cash flows to date and the contractual interest payments, principal amortization and fee notes due at maturity without giving effect to closing fees received, base management fees, incentive fees or general fund related expenses. For each floating rate loan, the projected fixed-rate equivalent coupon rate used to forecast the interest cash flows was calculated by adding the interest rate spread specified in the relevant loan document to the fixed-rate equivalent floating rate, duration-matched to the specific loan, adjusted by the floating rate floor and/or cap in place on that loan.

MCC Advisors’ services under the Investment Management Agreement were not exclusive, and it was free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us were not impaired.
 
Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, we paid MCC Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee.
 
The following discussion of our base management fee and two-part incentive fee reflect the terms of the fee waiver agreement executed by MCC Advisors on February 8, 2016 (the “Fee Waiver Agreement”). The terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement were effective as of January 1, 2016 and were a permanent reduction in the base management fee and incentive fee on net investment income payable to MCC Advisors for the investment advisory and management services it provided under the Investment Management Agreement. The Fee Waiver Agreement did not change the second component of the incentive fee, which was the incentive fee on capital gains.

On January 15, 2020, the Company’s board of directors, including all of the independent directors, approved the renewal of the Investment Management Agreement through the later of April 1, 2020 or so long as the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”), by and between the Company and Sierra (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”) was in effect, but no longer than a year; provided that, if the Amended MCC Merger Agreement was terminated by Sierra, then the termination of the Investment Management Agreement would be effective on the 30th day following receipt of Sierra’s notice of termination to the Company. On May 1, 2020, the Company received a notice of termination of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement from Sierra. Under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, either party was permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the Amended MCC Merger Agreement if the merger was not consummated by March 31, 2020. Sierra elected to do so on May 1, 2020. As result of the termination by Sierra of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement on May 1, 2020, the Investment Management Agreement would have been terminated effective as of May 31, 2020. On May 21, 2020, the Board, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Investment Management Agreement through the end of the then-current quarter, June 30, 2020. On June 12, 2020, the Board, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Investment Management Agreement through September 30, 2020. On September 29, 2020, the Board, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Investment Management Agreement through December 31, 2020. Mr. Brook Taube, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2020 and one of our directors through January 21, 2021 and Mr. Seth Taube, one of our directors through January 21, 2021 are both affiliated with MCC Advisors and Medley.
 
On November 18, 2020, the Board approved the adoption of an internalized management structure effective January 1, 2021. The new management structure replaces the current Investment Management and Administration Agreements with MCC Advisors LLC, which expired on December 31, 2020. To lead the internalized management team, the Board approved the appointment of David Lorber, who had served as an independent director of the Company since April 2019, as Chief Executive Officer, and Ellida McMillan as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each effective January 1, 2021. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Lorber stepped down from the Compensation Committee of the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, and the Special Committee of the Board.
 
Base Management Fee
 
Through December 31, 2020, for providing investment advisory and management services to us, MCC Advisors received a base management fee. The base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% per quarter) of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s gross assets and 1.50% (0.375% per quarter) of any amounts over $1.0 billion of the Company’s gross assets and was payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee was calculated based on the average value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.
Incentive Fee
 
Through December 31, 2020, the incentive fee had two components, as follows:
 
Incentive Fee Based on Income
 
The first component of the incentive fee was payable quarterly in arrears and was based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income earned during the calendar quarter for which the incentive fee was being calculated. MCC Advisors was entitled to receive the incentive fee on net investment income from us if our Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeded a quarterly “hurdle rate” of 1.5%. The hurdle amount was calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company’s net assets, as determined as of the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, in order to account for any capital raising or other capital actions as a result of any issuances by the Company of its common stock (including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan), any repurchase by the Company of its own common stock, and any dividends paid by the Company, each as may have occurred during the relevant quarter.
 
The second component of the incentive fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement as of the termination date) and equaled 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the investment adviser.
 
The Investment Management Agreement terminated as of December 31, 2020, and the Company no longer incurs base management fees or incentive fees under the Investment Management Agreement as a result.
 
Payment of Our Expenses
 
Since January 1, 2021, we are internally managed and do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing professionals and staff. We bear all costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, but not limited to those related to:

Investment Management Agreement Board Approval and Expiration
 
On January 15, 2020, the Company’s board of directors, including all of the independent directors, approved the renewal of the investment management agreement through the later of April 1, 2020 or so long as the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, was in effect, but no longer than a year; provided that, if the Amended MCC Merger Agreement were to be terminated by Sierra, then the termination of the investment management agreement would be effective on the 30th day following receipt of Sierra’s notice of such termination to the Company. In that regard, on May 1, 2020, the Company received a notice of termination of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement from Sierra. Under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, either party was permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the Amended MCC Merger Agreement if the merger was not consummated by March 31, 2020. As result of the termination by Sierra of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement on May 1, 2020, the investment management agreement would have been terminated effective as of May 31, 2020, without further action by our board of directors. On May 21, 2020, our board of directors, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the investment management agreement through the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2020. On June 15, 2020, our board of directors, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the investment management agreement through the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2020. On September 29, 2020, our board of directors, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the investment management agreement through the end of the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The Investment Management Agreement expired by its terms at the close of business on December 31, 2020, in connection with the adoption of the internalized management structure by the board of directors.

Expense Support Agreement
 
On June 12, 2020, the Company entered into an expense support agreement (the “Expense Support Agreement”) with MCC Advisors and Medley LLC, pursuant to which MCC Advisors and Medley LLC agreed (jointly and severally) to cap the management fee and all of the Company’s other operating expenses (except interest expenses, certain extraordinary strategic transaction expenses and other expenses approved by the Special Committee (as defined in Note 10)) at $667,000 per month (the “Cap”). Under the Expense Support Agreement, the Cap became effective on June 1, 2020 and expires on September 30, 2020. On September 29, 2020, the board of directors, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Expense Support Agreement through the end of quarter ending December 31, 2020. The Expense Support Agreement expired by its terms at the close of business on December 31, 2020, in connection with the adoption of the internalized management structure by the board of directors.
Administration Agreement
 
On January 19, 2011, the Company entered into an administration agreement with MCC Advisors. Pursuant to the administration agreement, MCC Advisors furnished us with office facilities and equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services related to the operations of the Company. We reimbursed MCC Advisors for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. From time to time, our administrator was able to pay amounts owed by us to third-party service providers and we would subsequently reimburse our administrator for such amounts paid on our behalf. In connection with the adoption by the board of directors of an internalized management structure, on November 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Fund Accounting Servicing Agreement and an Administration Servicing Agreement on customary terms with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC d/b/a U.S. Bank Global Fund Services (“U.S. Bancorp”). A U.S. Bancorp affiliate also served as the Company’s custodian. The Company’s administrative and custodial relationship with U.S. Bancorp terminated on August 9, 2022. SS&C Technologies, Inc. (“SS&C”) has since served as administrator of the Company and has provided us with fund accounting and financial reporting services pursuant to its Services Agreement with the Company. Effective September 12, 2022, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“Computershare”) serves as custodian for the Company pursuant to its Loan Administration and Custodial Agreement with the Company. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred $0.3 million, $0.6 million, and $2.2 million in administrator expenses, respectively.
Internalized Management Structure
 
On November 18, 2020, the board of directors approved adoption of an internalized management structure effective January 1, 2021. The new management structure replaced the investment management and administration agreements with MCC Advisors, which expired on December 31, 2020. The board approved the establishment of a committee, consisting of Arthur Ainsberg, Karin Hirtler-Garvey, Lowell Robinson and Howard Amster, to oversee the transition to the internalized management structure.
 
To lead the internalized management team, the board appointed David Lorber, who has served as an independent director of the Company since April 2019, as Chief Executive Officer and Ellida McMillan, who previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Alcentra Capital Corporation, a NASDAQ-traded BDC, from April 2017 until it merged into Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. in February 2020, as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, each effective January 1, 2021. Mr. Lorber is paid an annual base salary of $425,000, and Ms. McMillan is paid an annual base salary of $300,000, and each is eligible for one or more discretionary cash bonuses.
 
The internalized management team is responsible for the day-to-day management and operations of the Company, under the oversight of the board. The internalized management team presently consists of 4 investment professionals and 7 employees/consultants overall. The Company retained Alaric Compliance Services, LLC, whose officer serves as the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer. As discussed above, the Company has also entered into a services agreement on customary terms with SS&C, which serves as the Company’s administrator, as well as a loan administration and custodial agreement on customary terms with Computershare, who serves as our primary custodian.
 
REGULATION
 
General
 
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons”, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities.”
 
16

 

As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, reflecting the value of our total assets to our total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. However, in March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCA”) modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from 200% to 150%, if certain requirements are met. Under the 1940 Act, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive stockholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the 1940 Act allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective on the one-year anniversary of such approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage. The Company has not sought stockholder or independent director approval to reduce its coverage ratio to 150%.
 
On March 23, 2018, the SBCA was signed into law and, among other things, instructs the SEC to issue rules or amendments to rules allowing BDCs to use the same registration, offering and communication processes that are available to operating companies. The rules and amendments specified by the SBCA became self-implementing on March 24, 2019. On April 8, 2020, the SEC adopted rules and amendments to implement certain provisions of the SBCA (the “Final Rules”) that, among other things, modify the registration, offering, and communication processes available to BDCs relating to: (i) the shelf offering process to permit the use of short-form registration statements on Form N-2 and incorporation by reference; (ii) the ability to qualify for well-known seasoned issuer status; (iii) the immediate or automatic effectiveness of certain filings made in connection with continuous public offerings; and (iv) communication processes and prospectus delivery. In addition, the SEC adopted rules that will require BDCs to comply with certain structured data and inline XBRL requirements. The Final Rules generally became effective on August 1, 2020, except that a BDC eligible to file short-form registration statements on Form N-2, like the Company, must comply with the Inline XBRL structured data requirements for its financial statements, registration statement cover page, and certain prospectus information by August 1, 2022.
 
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 
Qualifying Assets
 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the Company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfies either of the following:
--+-----------------------------------


● | has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17

 

The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
 
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Regulation — Qualifying Assets” above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% requirement, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
 
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets”, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, certain diversification tests that must be met in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes will typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. We will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% (or 150% if certain requirements are met) immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or the repurchasing of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we use borrowed funds to make investments or fund our business operations, we will be exposed to risks typically associated with leverage which will increase the risk of investing in us.”
Code of Ethics
 
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The code of ethics is available at our website, www.phenixfc.com, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.
 
Privacy Policy
 
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
 
18

 

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).
 
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to our employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders.
 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 
Our Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by management and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
 
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 
Proxy Policies
 
Our proxy voting decisions are made by our investment professionals, who review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by the Company. Although the Company generally votes against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. We generally do not believe it is necessary to engage the services of an independent third party to assist in issue analysis and vote recommendation for proxy proposals. Under certain circumstances and when deemed in the best interests of shareholders, the Company may, in the discretion of its officers, refrain from exercising its proxy voting right for a particular decision.
 
To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties, unless such employee has received pre-approval from our Chief Compliance Officer.


Proxy Voting Records
 
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to:
 
Chief Compliance Officer
 PhenixFIN Corporation
 445 Park Avenue, 10th Floor
 New York, NY 10022
 
Other
 
Under the 1940 Act, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock, or issue and sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. However, we currently do not have the requisite stockholder approval, nor do we have any current plans to seek stockholder approval, to sell or issue shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per share.
 
In addition, at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders we received approval from our stockholders to authorize us, with the approval of our board of directors, to issue securities to, subscribe to, convert to, or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in one or more offerings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement. Such authorization has no expiration.
 
We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 
19

 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 
We adopted written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and will review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 
Election to Be Taxed as a RIC
 
We have elected and intend to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the “Distribution Requirement”).
 
Taxation as a RIC
 
As a RIC, if we satisfy the Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed to our stockholders.
 
We will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4% on undistributed income if we do not distribute at least the sum of 98% of our ordinary income in any calendar year, 98.2% of our capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October 31 of such year, and any income and capital gain net income that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we did not pay U.S. federal income tax. Depending on the level of investment company taxable income (“ICTI”) earned in a tax year and the amount of net capital gains recognized in such tax year, we may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year. In order to eliminate our liability for income tax, and to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification as a RIC, any such carryover ICTI and net capital gains must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to the 15th day of the 9th month after the close of the taxable year in which such ICTI was generated. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for U.S. federal excise tax purposes, we accrue U.S. federal excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned.


In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 

● | qualify to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;

We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income and franchise or withholding liabilities.

Any underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
 
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Distribution Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Business — Regulation — Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to satisfy the Distribution Requirement may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Distribution Requirement or avoid the imposition of excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 
Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not count towards satisfaction of the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay corporate level U.S. federal income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.
 
Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 
If we were unable to continue to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis in their shares of the RIC, and any distributions in excess of tax basis would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate level U.S. federal income tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.


Company Investments
 
Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (2) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (3) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (4) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (5) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (6) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (7) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% Income Test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification as a RIC.
 
Investments we make in securities issued at a discount or providing for deferred interest or payment of interest in kind are subject to special tax rules that will affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we will generally be required to accrue daily as income a portion of the discount and to distribute such income each year to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Since in certain circumstances we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty making distributions in the amounts necessary to satisfy the requirements for maintaining RIC tax treatment and for avoiding U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
 
In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. We do not expect to satisfy the requirements necessary to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.
 
If we purchase shares in a “passive foreign investment company’’ (a “PFIC’’), we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution’’ or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund’’ under the Code (a “QEF’’), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to us. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in certain PFICs; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax described above.
 
Income inclusions from a QEF will be “good income’’ for purposes of the 90% Income Test provided that they are derived in connection with our business of investing in stocks and securities or the QEF distributes such income to us in the same taxable year in which the income is included in our income.
