Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Daniels creates and implements corporate strategy alternatives for the mini-cap public or private company client. The addition of new business opportunities and the location of professional talent for implementation is anticipated through the full-time efforts of our senior management. These efforts are to be expanded in the United States and in foreign capitals by an expanding advisory board and through networks of independent consultants. Principals of the respective client company will open their networks to augment professional access for specialties the Daniels corporate strategy consultants believe are needed in a joint-venture, consensus-controlled undertaking created for the client’s optimum growth.
 
Daniels may provide the client with multiple corporate strategies/opportunities including joint-ventures, marketing opportunity agreements and/or potential acquisitions structured in leveraged buyout format. One or a combination of these strategies would allow the client to enter new market niches or expand further into existing ones.
 
Recent Business Developments
 
The Company is operating through the corporate strategy segment of its business. It is attempting to build its own critical mass by creation of start-up subsidiaries it believes have promise/potential. The stated goal is for the parent (DCAC) company to consolidate the critical mass of the subsidiary/start-ups with that of the parent for eventually listing on a major stock exchange. We have continued to focus our efforts on the build-out of the Daniels corporate strategy model. We constantly fine tune our strategy as it relates to the development of subsidiary start-ups and potential acquisitions for common stock. We concentrate on identifying projects that have the potential to produce significant earnings and multiple the potential of those results through leverage. This acceleration of levered growth and the acceptance of the risks associated, expedites the formation of the critical mass necessary to up-list.
 
As a result, we formed Payless Truckers, Inc. (“Payless”), a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 11, 2018. Payless is a start-up service company in the trucking industry. It has two business segments with its launch and current results coming from the “flip” segment, which principal business is to acquire class 8 heavy duty trucks, refurbish them, add location electronics, advertise and sell to independent drivers and operators. The second segment is the “credit rebuilding segment” where class 8 heavy duty trucks, owned by Daniels/Payless, are rented to experienced independent drivers. These independents rent for a period of up to five years and have the option to buy the vehicle at retail value every six months. In an effort to grow quickly and profitably, Daniels entered into an operating agreement with a senior operating management team in an effort to drive the business and better realize its earnings and growth potential.

The Payless two-segment trucking model has weathered many storms, including the Coronavirus and has grown stronger. Its operating model of a streamlined trucking service company continues to be refined. It is now one Daniels believes will survive any potential future slow-downs in the economy. The model was developed to allow for the maximum utilization of each truck.
 
We hope to further enhance our plan for growth beginning in our fourth year by forming joint-ventures and/or partnerships with truck maintenance companies across the United States in key traffic hubs. This will potentially afford independent drivers and operators the opportunity to be serviced by trusted maintenance facilities.
 
Business Strategy - Current Operational Strategy & Current Client Projects:
 
Daniels creates and implements corporate strategy alternatives for the mini-cap public or private company client. The addition of new business opportunities and the location of professional talent for implementation is anticipated through the full-time efforts of our senior management. These efforts are to be expanded in the US and in Foreign capitals by an expanding advisory board and through the networks of independent consultants. Principals of the respective client company will open their networks to augment professional access for specialties the Daniels corporate strategy project team believes are needed in a joint venture, consensus – controlled, undertaking for the client’s optimum growth.
 
Daniels may provide the client with multiple corporate strategies /opportunities including joint ventures, marketing opportunity agreements and/or potential acquisitions structured in a leveraged buyout format. One or a combination of these strategies would allow the client to enter new market niches or expand further into existing ones.
 
A similar effort will be provided to tailor an optimum growth program for the private company client, whether it chooses to remain private or to become a public company through alternative merger opportunities.
 
OPTIMUM GROWTH STRATEGY:
 
Daniels is confident that the validity of its corporate strategy model will be proven further through the success of its initial subsidiary incubation, Payless Truckers, Inc. The growing momentum of this cash flow engine should generate the interest of long-term straight debt financing sources. This “collective approach” to growth should provide initial seed capital for other startup subsidiaries or the acquisition and joint development of early-stage companies.
 
Daniels plans to use its publicly traded common stock in a variety of securities packages, including convertible preferred stock and warrants, to launch promising subsidiary start-ups, initially for generic sales/profits growth. Subsequent growth options noted above will be applied as external growth becomes a secondary goal. This method of two stage (generic and then external) growth is designed to leave existing client management with commanding equity and operating control positions. Eventually an optimum exit strategy will be developed for the subsidiary; one that returns a significant return on corporate (parent) capital.
 
The choices of optimum exit strategies could include bringing a subsidiary public, directly through a spin-off strategy or merging it with an exchange listed public company. The use of a collective cash flow and profits will allow expansion in one of the more profitable niches of any market designated for expansion. The same corporate strategy model can/will be applied to any independent mini-cap public client.
 
Senior management believes our corporate strategy business model to be scalable. We continue to add to our networks, both talent and capital and can expand support staff as client additions warrant it. Based upon the success of our strategy model in initial corporate consulting assignments – causing the listing of our stock on a major Stock Exchange, Daniels may entertain the creation of a franchising plan for key US cities and foreign capitals that are finance centers.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Daniels senior management will concentrate its efforts to expand its corporate strategy and financial advisory services and related specialties in the mini-cap segment of the private and public markets, where Daniels believes it will be effective. Marketing efforts will increase through social and print media efforts and will be in addition to those methods already mentioned herein.
 
Daniels’ objective is to create and help manage implementation of accelerated expansion strategies and in so doing, aid in the creation of financing alternatives to accomplish client goals.
 
Competition
 
Existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive price and performance characteristics.
 
Our “collective” corporate financial service offerings will be expanded as our cash flow and following on social media grows. Merchant banking/private equity would be obvious additions. These financial services are competitive but fragmented in the Company’s market niche. While there are limited barriers to entry and new better capitalized competitors frequently enter the market, management believes our being very selective in client/candidate choice and tailoring our model to fit the specific client needs at competitive pricing will give us a competitive advantage.
