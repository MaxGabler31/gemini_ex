Item 1. Business
The Company
Big Lots, Inc., an Ohio corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiaries is a home discount retailer operating in the United States (“U.S.”). At January 29, 2022, we operated a total of 1,431 stores and an e-commerce platform. Our mission is to help people Live BIG and Save LOTS. Our vision is to be the BIG difference for a better life by delivering exceptional value to customers, building a “best places to grow” culture, rewarding shareholders with consistent growth and top tier returns, and doing good in local communities.
Our principal executive offices are located at 4900 E. Dublin-Granville Road, Columbus, Ohio 43081, and our telephone number is (614) 278‑6800.
Unless this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Big Lots, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Similar to many other retailers, our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in some fiscal years consisting of 52 weeks and some fiscal years consisting of 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this Form 10-K relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. The following table summarizes our fiscal year calendar and the number of weeks in each fiscal year:

Fiscal Year | Number of Weeks | Year Begin Date | Year End Date 
2022 | 52 | January 30, 2022 | January 28, 2023
2021 | 52 | January 31, 2021 | January 29, 2022
2020 | 52 | February 2, 2020 | January 30, 2021
2019 | 52 | February 3, 2019 | February 1, 2020
2018 | | February 4, 2018 | February 2, 2019
2017 | | January 29, 2017 | February 3, 2018

We manage our business on the basis of one segment: discount retailing. Our seven merchandise categories, which match our internal management and reporting of merchandise net sales are: Food; Consumables; Soft Home; Hard Home; Furniture; Seasonal; and Apparel, Electronics, & Other. The Food category includes our beverage & grocery; specialty foods; and pet departments. The Consumables category includes our health, beauty and cosmetics; plastics; paper; and chemical departments. The Soft Home category includes our home décor; frames; fashion bedding; utility bedding; bath; window; decorative textile; and area rugs departments. The Hard Home category includes our small appliances; table top; food preparation; stationery; home maintenance; home organization; and toys departments. The Furniture category includes our upholstery; mattress; ready-to-assemble; and case goods departments. The Seasonal category includes our lawn & garden; summer; Christmas; and other holiday departments. The Apparel, Electronics, & Other department includes our apparel; electronics; jewelry; hosiery; and candy & snacks departments, as well as the assortments for The Lot and the Queue Line (see the discussion under the caption “Operating Strategy - Shopping Experience” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information regarding The Lot and Queue Line).
In 2021, we realigned certain departments within select merchandise categories to be consistent with the realignment of our merchandising team and changes to our management reporting. In order to provide comparative information, we have reclassified our results into the new alignment for all periods presented. See the reclassifications section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Merchandising
We focus our merchandising strategy on (1) the bargain hunt, by seeking to deliver unmatched value in all of our merchandise categories; (2) the treasure hunt, by seeking to surprise and delight our customers with our unique product assortment; and (3) convenience, by seeking to offer a reliable assortment of simple to shop essentials. We utilize traditional sourcing methods in purchasing both imported and domestic products and, in certain merchandise categories, we also take advantage of closeout channels to enhance our ability to offer outstanding value and bring surprise and delight into our product offerings. Closeouts are generally sourced from production overruns, packaging changes, discontinued products, order cancellations, liquidations, returns, and other disruptions in the supply chain of manufacturers, but can also include engineered closeouts and other sourcing options.
We evaluate our product offerings to ensure we are providing quality and exceptional value, and meeting our customer’s expectations. We believe that focusing on our customers’ expectations has improved our ability to provide a more relevant and desirable assortment of offerings in our merchandise categories. 
In 2021, we introduced the concept of “Big Buys” to our merchandising strategy. Big Buys include closeouts and other one-time product offerings that fit into the bargain hunt facet of our merchandising strategy. 
We curate our assortment by focusing on delivering (1) Big Buys, deals where customers can realize exceptional value; (2) seasonal and trendy items that serve to continually refresh our assortment; and (3) everyday essentials that provide consistency and convenience in our staple product offerings. We have increased our sourcing and purchasing of quality closeout merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors, typically at prices lower than those paid by traditional discount retailers, to accelerate our ability to deliver Big Buys. We believe that our strong vendor relationships and our strong credit profile support this sourcing model, and we intend to grow our Big Buys merchandise offerings during 2022.
Our global sourcing team and overseas vendor relationships continue to represent important components of our merchandising strategy. We expect our import partners to responsibly source goods that our merchandising teams identify as having our desired mix of quality and value. During 2021, we purchased approximately 24% of our merchandise, at cost, directly from overseas vendors, including approximately 15% from vendors located in China. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. As a result, a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
Advertising and Marketing
We believe that our brand image is an important part of why our customers choose to shop Big Lots. We also believe our brand image is important to the value proposition that we convey through all of our customer touchpoints. We employ an integrated approach for our marketing touchpoints and investments consisting of (1) paid media, including television, print, digital, social media, internet, e-mail, and payment card-linked marketing; (2) earned media, including public relations and organic social media; and (3) owned media, including our website, customer loyalty programs, and in-store signage. Total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was 1.6%, 1.7%, and 1.8% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
In 2021, we conducted extensive consumer research to enhance our understanding of why customers shop us and barriers for those individuals that do not shop us. We have used this research to refine our brand positioning and implement changes to our messaging across all marketing touchpoints. Through this research, we learned that our customers believe we excel in four key areas or brand pillars: exceptional value, surprising products, easy shopping, and a delightful experience. Accordingly, our marketing strategy is grounded in these brand pillars. Our marketing tactics are intended to: (1) create a community of bargain hunters and treasure seekers; (2) drive incremental visits from new and existing customers; (3) increase our brand awareness, brand consideration and purchasers; and (4) drive personalized marketing based on our customer data platform. Our consumer research also influences how we merchandise our stores, invest in omnichannel capabilities, design our shopping experience, and invest in our business.
In 2021, we introduced our “Be a BIGionaire” advertising campaign, featuring three household-name celebrities to spread our message, that tells our customers they can feel like a million bucks by finding the best deals at Big Lots and decorating their homes with our products. 
Our customer data is an important marketing tool that allows us to communicate with our customers in a cost-effective, personalized, and relevant manner, including through e-mail delivery of our circulars, announcement of flash sales, and product-specific promotions. At January 29, 2022, our customer loyalty program, which we call the “BIG Rewards Program,” included approximately 22 million active members who had made a purchase in our stores in the last 12 months, compared to 
Table of Contents

approximately 21 million members at January 30, 2021. In addition to the customer communications mentioned above, our BIG Rewards Program rewards our customers for making frequent and/or high-ticket purchases and offers a special birthday reward. We utilize insights gained through the BIG Rewards Program to evaluate the effectiveness of our promotions, tailor promotions to our customers’ shopping habits, and gain consumer insights. Our research shows that membership in the BIG Rewards Program is a driver of net sales, and we incentivize our store associates to encourage customer enrollment into the program.
We believe our approach to retailing differentiates us from the competition and allows us to make a difference in the communities we serve. Our community-oriented approach to retailing includes “doing good as we do well,” which means supporting both local and national causes that aid the communities in which we do business. In our local markets, we invest in point of sale campaigns in each of our geographic regions, the beneficiaries of which are selected based on their impacts on local customers and associates. We serve the community on a national level through our Big Lots Foundation, which focuses on healthcare, housing, hunger, and education. In addition, we are pleased to support our local community in Columbus, OH through our partnership with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, to which the Company committed $40 million and the Big Lots Foundation committed $10 million to open the Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical facility dedicated to child and adolescent mental and behavioral health, in 2020.
Competition
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry. We face strong sales competition from other general merchandise, discount, home, food, furniture, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers, which operate in traditional brick and mortar stores and/or online. Additionally, we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations, for distribution site locations, to attract and retain quality employees, and to acquire our broad merchandising assortment from vendors. We operate an e-commerce platform which faces additional competition from a wider range of retailers in a highly competitive marketplace, where we compete for customers, fulfillment capabilities, and technological innovation.

Louisiana | 20 | North Dakota | 1 | | | | 
 | | | | Total stores | 1,431 | 
 | | | | Number of states | 47 

Of our 1,431 stores, 33% operate in four states: California, Texas, Florida, and Ohio, and net sales from stores in these states represented 33% of our 2021 net sales. We have a concentration in these states based on their size, population, and customer base.
Warehouse and Distribution
While certain of our merchandise vendors deliver directly to our stores, the large majority of our inventory is staged and delivered from our distribution centers to facilitate prompt and efficient distribution and transportation of merchandise to our stores and help maximize our sales and inventory turnover.
The majority of our merchandise offerings are processed for retail sale and distributed to our stores from five regional distribution centers located in Alabama, California, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. 
We selected the locations of our regional distribution centers to help manage transportation costs and to minimize the distance from our distribution centers to our stores. 
In addition to our regional distribution centers that handle store merchandise, we operate two other warehouses within our Ohio distribution center. One warehouse distributes fixtures and supplies to our stores and our five regional distribution centers and the other warehouse serves as our fulfillment center for our e-commerce operations. To supplement our e-commerce fulfillment center, we also fulfill direct-ship e-commerce orders from 65 of our store locations, which we strategically selected based on geographic location, size, and other relevant factors. We also fulfill some of our e-commerce orders using supplier direct fulfillment, a process in which the customer purchases merchandise through our e-commerce platform, but the merchandise is shipped directly from the supplier to the customer. Supplier direct fulfillment is primarily used for bulky items that are more costly to warehouse and ship. We continue to evaluate our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities to reduce shipping times. 
In 2021, we opened two small-format forward distribution centers to divert processing and logistics for bulk goods out of our regional distribution centers into our forward distribution centers, thereby increasing the efficiency of our regional distribution centers, which were designed to most efficiently process cartons as opposed to bulk goods. Our two forward distribution centers are operated by a third-party logistics services provider and are located in Georgia and Pennsylvania. Our forward distribution centers also diversified our distribution center labor force, which reduced the impact of COVID-19 related absences on our supply chain. We believe further expansion of our distribution network with forward distribution centers is necessary to grow our net sales and store count over the next several years. In 2022, we intend to open two additional forward distribution centers, and we will continue to evaluate whether we need to open additional forward distribution centers in the future.

Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas holiday selling season. Our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, advertising, and certain holidays. We historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise, carry higher inventory levels, and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during our fourth fiscal quarter. Performance during our fourth fiscal quarter typically reflects a leveraging effect which has a favorable impact on our operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs, such as rent and depreciation, are fixed and do not vary as sales levels escalate. If our sales performance is significantly better or worse during the Christmas holiday selling season, we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results than if our sales performance is significantly better or worse in a different season.
Our net sales in the second quarter of 2020 as a percentage of full year were disproportionately higher as a result of increased demand arising from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government stimulus payments. Similarly, our net sales in the first quarter of 2021 as a percentage of full year were disproportionately higher as demand increased due to government stimulus payments related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic persists, we believe the seasonality of our 2022 results will more closely resemble the historical seasonality of our business, including the seasonality we experienced in 2019 (excluding the one-time gain on sale of distribution center in 2019 discussed in a footnote to the table below).
The following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit (loss) for 2021, 2020, and 2019 by fiscal quarter:

 | First | Second | Third | Fourth
Fiscal Year 2021 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 26.4 | % | 23.7 | % | 21.7 | % | 28.2 | %
Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of full year | 51.1 | | 22.5 | | (1.7) | | 28.1 | 
Fiscal Year 2020 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 23.2 | % | 26.5 | % | 22.2 | % | 28.1 | %
Operating profit as a percentage of full year (a) | 8.7 | | 71.0 | | 5.0 | | 15.3 | 
Fiscal Year 2019 | | | | 
Net sales as a percentage of full year | 24.3 | % | 23.5 | % | 21.9 | % | 30.3 | %
Operating profit as a percentage of full year (b) | 7.7 | | 3.9 | | 50.9 | | 37.5 | 

(a) The second quarter of 2020 included a gain on sale of distribution centers and related expenses of $459.1 million related to the sale and leaseback of four distribution centers, which significantly increased second quarter operating profit as a percentage of full year in comparison to 2019 and 2021.
(b) The third quarter of 2019 included a gain on sale of distribution center of $178.5 million, which significantly increased third quarter operating profit as a percentage of full year in comparison to 2020 and 2021.

Human Capital
At January 29, 2022, we had approximately 36,200 active associates comprised of 10,500 full-time and 25,700 part‑time associates. Approximately 71% of the associates we employed during 2021 were employed on a part-time basis. Temporary associates hired for the holiday selling season increased the total number of associates to a peak of approximately 37,200 in 2021. We are not a party to any labor agreements. We require all of our associates to adhere to our code of ethics and workplace safety protocols.
We believe our associates are among our most important resources. We evaluate our human capital management at our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters on the basis of associate engagement, diversity, equity, and inclusion, compensation and benefits, and talent development.
Associate Engagement
We send an associate engagement survey to each of the associates in our corporate headquarters and to our field and distribution center leadership on an annual basis to assess our associate engagement and ask those associates their thoughts on manager effectiveness, performance enablement, and our diversity and inclusion efforts. In 2021, 93% of the associates surveyed responded to the survey with an 82% favorable engagement rate. Based on results of the annual survey, our leaders create action plans to address areas where our associates have told us we can improve.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We recognize the value of creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. As a result, diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) is a significant component of our human capital management. In 2020, we established our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council (“DEI Council”), which is comprised of associates from our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters who represent various job levels, locations, ages, genders, languages, work shifts, races, sexual orientations, and leadership styles. The DEI Council’s mission is to lead the development and advancement of our DEI strategy. Additionally, we formed a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Executive Advisory Committee, which is comprised of senior leaders who provide guidance to the DEI Council, as well as approve our DEI strategy and promote its achievement throughout our organization. In 2021, our corporate associates, field leaders, and distribution center leaders participated in a five-part conscious inclusion program taking place over the course of five months to build awareness, educate our associates on how we can improve DEI, and ultimately engrain DEI in the culture of the Company. This conscious inclusion program has been converted to online training and will be part of our onboarding process for all of our new associates.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer a competitive compensation and benefits package to our eligible associates including, among other benefits, incentive compensation, performance-based merit pay, paid holidays, paid vacation, 401(k) match, and healthcare coverage, including medical, dental, and vision insurance with health savings account and flexible savings account options. Our compensation and benefits packages are designed to attract and retain high-performing talent. Additionally, we provide our associates with a company discount on our merchandise and our associates redeemed over $30 million in corporate discounts in 2021.
Talent Development
Talent development is critical to developing the high-performance culture that we seek to foster. Each of our associates participates in an annual goal-setting process and completes an annual performance review, which is followed by periodic discussions throughout the year to assess progress. Each of our managers also completes an individual development plan on an annual basis to set and track long-term goals. Additionally, our business leaders participate in a succession planning process that serves as a tool for identifying and developing high-potential individuals within our organization as well as ensuring business continuity. We also offer a robust catalog of training and development programs to our associates through our Big Lots University training tool, which covers topics including, but not limited to, workplace harassment, safety, ethics, and job skills.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our associates is of the utmost importance. We have implemented comprehensive safety protocols in each of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices to ensure the safety of associates, customers, and other visitors in each facility. We require each of our associates to complete safety training courses relevant to their jobs, which we track using e-learning tools to ensure compliance. In addition to traditional safety training, we require all of our associates to participate in aggressor/active shooter training and we require our store associates to participate in argumentative and de-escalating conversations training. We reinforce safety standards with re-training requirements and regular, engaging communications. To provide a safe working environment for our associates and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased sanitization protocols, secured personal protective equipment for our associates, installed plexiglass at all registers, implemented social distancing and mask protocols at our stores and distribution centers, and implemented daily health screens 
Table of Contents

and temperature checks for all associates. We have adjusted, and continue to adjust, our COVID-19-related safety protocols based on the advice of medical experts and federal, state, and local guidelines.
