Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology (“I-O”) company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of innovative combination therapies and committed to bringing effective medicines to patients with cancer.  Our business is designed to drive success in I-O through speed, innovation, and effective combination therapies. We have assembled fully integrated capabilities from novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development, and good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) manufacturing together with a comprehensive portfolio consisting of antibody-based therapeutics, adjuvants and cancer vaccine platforms. We leverage our immune biology platforms to identify effective combination therapies for development and have developed productive partnerships to advance our innovation.  
 We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will build on clinically validated antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 combined with novel immuno-modulatory agents designed to address underlying tumor immune-escape mechanisms.  
 Our pipeline of immuno-modulatory antibodies target important nodes of immune regulation, including our proprietary lead antibodies, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1.  We are aiming to develop, register, and launch these products with a first potential biologics license application (“BLA”) filing as early as the second-half of 2019.  We will then endeavor to expand on these agents with combinations of novel compounds designed to address tumor escape mechanisms, such as intratumoral Treg and tumor microenvironment conditioning.
In addition, for tumors not yet visible to the immune system, we are leveraging our immune educating neoantigen vaccine platform, designed to target mutationally based and biochemically based (phosphorylated) neoantigens (AutoSynVax and PhosPhoSynVax) to prime the immune system to attack tumors. These vaccines may be applicable for patients where checkpoint modulating (“CPM”) antibodies alone are not sufficient to bring about tumor control.  
 Advances in our understanding of the interactions between cancers, the tumor microenvironment, and the immune system have led to powerful new approaches to treat cancer.  We recently formed a new subsidiary, AgenTus Therapeutics, to bring innovative living drugs to cancer patients. AgenTus is employing an integrated platform to discover and develop novel living drugs to treat a broad range of cancers.
 To succeed in I-O, innovation and speed are paramount.  We are a vertically integrated biotechnology company equipped with a suite of technology platforms to advance from novel target identification (Retrocyte Display, SECANT, Agenus Immunogenic Platform (“AIM”), functional genomics and ligandomics) through manufacturing for clinical trials of antibodies and vaccines. 
 Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AGEN.”
 
Our Vision
 We believe that harnessing innovation and speed with combinations of drugs are key to bringing effective treatments to patients with certain cancers. We have assembled fully integrated capabilities in novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development, and GMP manufacturing, together with a comprehensive portfolio consisting of antibody-based therapeutics, adjuvants and cancer vaccines. We believe that a balanced pipeline of product candidates should focus on both validated targets as well as novel targets designed to address tumor escape mechanisms. CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists are recognized as the first clinically validated immunotherapy combination. These, in combination with innovative immuno-modulatory antibodies or immune education vaccines, could be a focal point of the next generation of I-O combinations. Therefore, we plan to develop, register, and launch, our proprietary PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibody programs aggressively through the clinic and expand with novel combination therapies designed to improve the clinical response and durability response of existing therapies.
Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to combine our antibodies, vaccines, and adjuvants to develop effective combinations designed to yield best-in-class treatments for patients with cancer. We are pursuing a tiered risk profile and targeting compressed timelines for regulatory filings. We are executing on a clinical development plan with our anti-CTLA-4 (AGEN1884) and anti-PD-1 (AGEN2034) in definable patient populations. In addition, we plan to pursue select indications to further expedite market entry. 
 Our combination clinical trial of AGEN1884 with Keytruda in patients with first line non-small cell lung cancer (“1L NSCLC”) with high PD-L1 expression is targeting a definable population indicated for Keytruda monotherapy where combination with our CTLA-4 could potentially expand the clinical benefit beyond Keytruda on its own. Second line cervical cancer is also an indication that is responsive to PD-1 blockade and where combination with CTLA-4 could potentially expand clinical benefit, present a differentiated development path, and potentially provide a niche opportunity in certain markets. Some of our additional programs may pose moderate regulatory risk and will entail: 1) pursuit of effective I-O antibody and vaccine combinations with CTLA-4 and/or PD-
 3

1 targeted antibodies as the backbone; and 2) advancement of our differentiated antibody programs such as our first-in-class bispecific programs, a next generation anti-CTLA-4, and a differentiated CD137 and TIGIT. 
 Part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing arrangements with collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations.
 Our Assets
 Our I-O assets include antibody-based therapeutics, cancer vaccine platforms, and adjuvants. Our proprietary CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists are in clinical development; we are one of the few companies to have a proprietary anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 in clinical combinations.  
 To complement our portfolio of foundational CPMs, we have pre-clinical antibodies targeting novel immune-mechanisms. These include next-generation anti-CTLA-4, CD137 and anti-TIGIT antibodies, as well as undisclosed multi-specific antibodies. 
 We have proprietary cancer vaccine platforms which are designed to be autologous (Prophage) and individualized (AutoSynVax (“ASV”); PhosphoSynVax (“PSV”)).  Our Prophage and synthetic ASV and PSV vaccine candidates are protein complexes that consist of heat shock proteins (“HSPs”) and peptides that are either tumor-derived or tailor-made based on the unique genomic fingerprint of a patient’s tumor, respectively. Our vaccine programs are being developed for intended combinations with CPMs.
 Our QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline plc. (“GSK”) and is a key component in multiple GSK vaccine programs.  GSK's Shingrix vaccine, which contains our QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Health Canada and recently received the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommendation for approval. 
 Our Antibody Discovery Platforms and CPM Programs
 Checkpoint antibodies regulate immune response against pathogens that invade the body and are achieving positive outcomes in a number of cancers that were untreatable only a few years ago. Two classes of checkpoint targets include:

1. | inhibitory checkpoints that help suppress an immune response in order to prevent excessive immune reaction resulting in undesired inflammation and/or auto-immunity, and
2. | stimulatory checkpoints that can enhance or amplify an antigen-specific immune response. 

 We possess a suite of antibody discovery platforms that are designed to drive the discovery of future CPM antibody candidates.  We are planning to employ a variety of techniques to identify and optimize mono-specific and multi-specific antibody candidates, internally. 
 We have presented clinical data on our lead antibody, AGEN1884, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) in June 2017. We have also presented pre-clinical and clinical data on our anti-CTLA-4 (AGEN1884), anti-PD-1 (AGEN2034), and ASV programs as well as our partnered programs GITR (INCAGN1876) and OX-40 (INCAGN1949) at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) April 2017, Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) November 2017, the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference (“CIMT”) May 2017, and CRI-CIMT-EATI-AACR International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference in September 2017. The presentations covered pre-clinical pharmacology for our antibodies and demonstrated that AGEN1884 binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T cells and potently blocks engagement of CD80 and CD86, leading to enhanced T cell responsiveness. We also reported:
  
• | data that AGEN1884 augmented vaccine response in primates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical data on safety and preliminary efficacy of AGEN1884, which supported our expectations of the safety profile;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that we observed a complete response in a compassionate use setting in a patient with advanced angiosarcoma, who was unresponsive to prior therapies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | data demonstrating that AGEN2034, a novel human IgG4 anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody, inhibits PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in enhanced T cell responsiveness in vitro as well as in a non-human primate model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that AGEN2034 combined effectively with AGEN1884, a human IgG1 anti-CTLA-4 antibody, anti-TIGIT or anti-LAG-3 to further enhance T cell responsiveness;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that AIM can predict immunogenic peptides containing neoantigens and tumor specific phosphopeptides to develop immunogenic vaccines; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical data demonstrating ASV can effectively deliver antigens and induce an anti-tumor immunogenic response and pre-clinical data revealing that these vaccinogenic responses are optimized with combination checkpoint modulating antibodies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are developing our anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with Keytruda in a definable cohort of patients in 1L NSCLC with high PD-L1 (>50%) expression, where Keytruda is approved for use as a monotherapy with <50% response rates. We also plan to develop our proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with our proprietary anti-PD-1 antibody in second line cervical cancer. Chemoradiation therapy is the current standard of care for earlier lines of treatment. In distant metastatic patients, platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, is the current standard of care. However, there are no established therapies for second 
 4

line cervical cancer and the five-year survival rate of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer is 16.8%. Cervical cancer is a malignancy that is driven by the persistent infection by certain types of human papilloma virus (“HPV”). Anti PD-1/PD-L1 have shown to be active in virally induced disease and, specifically, HPV induced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. In these tumors, anti PD-1 blockade might induce objective responses as well as prolongation of survival.
 In addition to pursuing validated targets, our discovery pipeline includes next generation molecules to known targets (such as TIGIT and CD137) as well as potential first-in-class bispecific antibodies designed to go beyond T cell targeting to address tumor escape mechanisms within the tumor micro-environment. The most advanced of our discovery pipeline is our next generation CTLA-4, an IgG1 anti-CTLA-4 antagonist. This molecule is advancing through Investigational New Drug (“IND”) enablement.
 Partnered CPM Programs
 In January 2015, we entered into a broad, global alliance with Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”) to discover, develop and commercialize novel immuno-therapeutics using our antibody platforms. The collaboration was initially focused on four CPM programs targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3, and in November 2015, we expanded the alliance by adding three novel undisclosed CPM targets. Pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, Incyte made non-creditable, non-refundable upfront payments to us totaling $25.0 million. Targets under the collaboration were designated as either profit-share programs, where the parties shared all costs and profits equally, or royalty-bearing programs, where Incyte funded all costs, and we were eligible to receive milestones and royalties. Under the original collaboration agreement, programs targeting GITR, OX40 and two of the undisclosed targets were designated as profit-share programs, while the other targets were royalty-bearing programs. For each profit-share product, we were eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. For each royalty-bearing product, we were eligible to receive (i) up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones and (ii) tiered royalties on global net sales at rates generally ranging from 6%-12%. Concurrent with the execution of the original collaboration agreement, we and Incyte also entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Incyte purchased approximately 7.76 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million, or approximately $4.51 per share. In February 2017, we and Incyte amended the terms of the original collaboration agreement to, among other things, convert the GITR and OX40 programs from profit-share to royalty-bearing programs with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate for each. In addition, the profit-share programs relating to two undisclosed targets were removed from the collaboration, with one reverting to Incyte and one to Agenus (the latter being our TIGIT antibody program), each with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate. The remaining three royalty-bearing programs in the collaboration targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target remain unchanged, and there are no more profit-share programs under the collaboration. Pursuant to the amended agreement, we received accelerated milestone payments of $20.0 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist). Across all programs in the collaboration, we are now eligible to receive up to a total of $510.0 million in future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Concurrent with the execution of the amendment agreement, we and Incyte entered into a separate stock purchase agreement whereby Incyte purchased an additional 10 million shares of Agenus common stock at $6.00 per share. Immediately following the transaction, Incyte owned approximately 18.1% of our outstanding common stock.
 At the April 2016 AACR conference, we presented data for two antibody candidates under the Incyte collaboration: INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist) and INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist). The presentations covered pre-clinical pharmacology for each antibody, including optimized features. At AACR 2017, we presented additional pre-clinical data for both INCAGN1949 and INCAGN1876 which further characterized these antibody candidates. In June 2016, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INCAGN1876. The Phase 1/2 trial is exploring the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of INCAGN1876 combined with immune therapies, ipilimumab and nivolumab, in advanced or metastatic malignancies such as advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer, gastric cancer (including stomach, esophageal, and gastroesophageal junction), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In addition, in November 2016 we announced the commencement of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INCAGN1949. The Phase 1/2 trial is exploring the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of INCAGN1949 combined with immune therapies, ipilimumab and nivolumab, in advanced or metastatic malignancies such as advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or RCC.  
 In addition, in April 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Merck to discover and optimize fully-human antibodies against two undisclosed CPM targets. Merck selected a lead product candidate against one of the undisclosed Merck targets to advance into preclinical studies, leading to a $2.0 million milestone payment that we received in May 2016. In November 2017, we announced we had received a $4.0 million payment for the advancement of the undisclosed antibody under our license and research collaboration agreement with Merck. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck is responsible for all future product development expenses for the selected antibody candidate. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $99.0 million in milestone payments, in addition to royalties on any worldwide product sales.
 In 2017, we also formalized a research collaboration with UCB Biopharma SPRL (“UCB”). The collaboration leverages the antibody engineering capabilities of UCB and Agenus in novel bispecific antibody discovery. In addition, we have a collaboration agreement with Recepta Biopharma SA on the development of our antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1, which gives Recepta certain rights to South American countries. We expect to continue exploring additional future collaborations.
 Vaccine Platforms
 5

Our current vaccine platforms for the treatment of cancer, and potentially other indications, include our HSP based Prophage vaccine candidates, and our fully synthetic, neoantigen vaccine candidates, ASV and PSV.
 HSPs are a group of proteins present at high levels in most mammalian cells. Their expression is increased when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or other stresses. A potential role for HSPs in regulating immune responses was revealed when it was first discovered that HSP complexes purified from cancer cells produced immunity to cancer, whereas HSP complexes purified from normal tissue did not. This discovery led to the understanding that HSPs bind to and carry a broad sampling of the protein environment within cells, including mutant proteins that might arise from genetic mutations within cancer cells. It was further shown that immunization with HSP complexes purified from tumors generate both CD4 and CD8 positive T-cell immune responses. These activated T-cells target the cancer cells of the tumor, from which the HSP complexes were derived, for destruction. Thus, HSP complexes isolated from cancer cells may be particularly helpful in mediating successful immunization. Since HSPs are expressed in all tumor cells, the approach of immunizing with the HSP complexes isolated from a particular tumor may be broadly applicable to a variety of cancer types. We believe that we pioneered the use of gp96, an HSP, purified from a patient’s own tumor tissue, as a way to make I-O vaccine candidates. 
     Prophage Vaccine Candidates
 Our Prophage cancer vaccine candidate, HSPPC-96, is an autologous cancer vaccine therapy derived from cancer tissues that are surgically removed from an individual patient. As a result, a Prophage vaccine contains a broad sampling of potentially antigenic mutant proteins from each patient’s own tumor. Prophage vaccines are designed to program the body’s immune system to target only the specific cells that express those mutant antigens, thereby reducing the risk that the body’s immune response against the tumor after vaccination will also affect healthy tissue. Enhancing immune response using personalized vaccines, particularly in combination with CPMs, could be useful in cancers where a low number of mutant proteins leads to weakened immunogenicity. 
 To date, more than 1,000 patients have been treated with Prophage vaccines in clinical trials internationally, covering a broad range of cancer types, and no serious immune-mediated side effects have been observed. The results of these trials have been published and/or presented at scientific conferences. These results indicate observable clinical and/or immunological activity across many types of cancer.
 In January 2017, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”). The double-blind, randomized controlled Phase 2 trial is evaluating the effect of Prophage in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) in patients with ndGBM. The trial is being conducted by the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (“BTTC”), a consortium of top academic centers led by Dr. Mark Gilbert, Chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NCI Center for Cancer Research. The trial consists of two-arms with one arm receiving pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and a second arm receiving both Prophage and pembrolizumab in combination. Forty-five patients are being randomly assigned to each arm. Under this collaboration, we are supplying Prophage, Merck is supplying pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) and NCI and BTTC member sites are recruiting patients and conducting the trial. 
     Neoantigen Vaccine Platforms
 Mutation-based neo-epitopes, which will form the basis for the immunogens used in ASV, appear to be almost always particular to a given patient. Therefore, ASV is a largely individualized vaccine product candidate. With a small amount of a patient’s tumor as a sample, our ASV program is designed to utilize next generation sequencing technologies coupled with complex bioinformatics algorithms to identify mutations in a tumor’s DNA and RNA. Once these mutations have been identified, we plan to manufacture synthetic peptides encoding these neoepitopes, load these peptides on to our recombinant HSP70 and deliver a fully synthetic polyvalent vaccine to the patient. This program is based on the hypothesis that the HSP70 platform would shuttle the mutated peptides to sites where they could be recognized by the immune system and elicit a cytotoxic and helper T cell response in patients with cancer. 
 Biochemically based neoantigens, such as those arising from dysregulated phosphorylation of various proteins in malignant cells, can serve as a tumor fingerprint across a broad histology of tumors. Through the acquisition of PhosImmune, we have a portfolio of proprietary phosphorylated antigenic targets that can be used for therapeutic development. PSV is a vaccine candidate designed to induce immunity against this novel class of tumor specific neoepitopes. PSV is intended to induce cellular immunity to abnormal phosphopeptide neoepitopes that are characteristic of these various forms of cancer. Phosphopeptides (or phosphopeptide analogues) can be synthesized and complexed with HSP70, using an approach analogous to that used in the generation of our previous HerpV vaccine candidate. HerpV demonstrated good cellular and humoral responses to synthetic peptide immunogens complexed with HSP70 in a placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. We believe that similar responses could be obtained to phosphopeptide or phosphopeptide analogues bound to HSP70 when used as vaccines. Phosphorylation-based neoepitopes can apparently be found on specific types of cancer in many patients. Studies to optimize the immunogens to be used in PSV are ongoing.
     QS-21 Stimulon Adjuvant
 QS-21 Stimulon is an adjuvant, which is a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance an immune response to the target antigens. QS-21 Stimulon is a natural product, a triterpene glycoside, or saponin, purified from the bark of the Chilean soapbark tree, Quillaja saponaria. QS-21 Stimulon has the ability to stimulate an antibody-mediated immune response and has also been shown to activate cellular immunity. It has become a key component in the development of investigational 
 6

preventive vaccine formulations across a wide variety of diseases. These studies have been carried out by academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. A number of these studies have shown QS-21 Stimulon to be significantly more effective in stimulating immune responses than aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, the adjuvants most commonly used in approved vaccines in the United States today.
 Partnered QS-21 Stimulon Programs
 In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement and a supply agreement with GSK for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK License Agreement” and the “GSK Supply Agreement,” respectively). In January 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Manufacturing Technology Transfer and Supply Agreement (the “Amended GSK Supply Agreement”) under which GSK has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon. GSK is obligated to supply us, or our affiliates, licensees, or customers, certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon for a stated period of time. In March 2012, we entered into a First Right to Negotiate and Amendment Agreement amending the GSK License Agreement and the Amended GSK Supply Agreement to clarify and include additional rights for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement”). In addition, we granted GSK the first right to negotiate for the purchase of Agenus or certain of our assets, which expired in March 2017. As consideration for entering into the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement, GSK paid us an upfront, non-refundable payment of $9.0 million, $2.5 million of which is creditable toward future royalty payments. We refer to the GSK License Agreement, the Amended GSK Supply Agreement and the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement collectively as the GSK Agreements. In 2017, we received a final milestone payment of $1.0 million from GSK and are no longer entitled to any additional milestone payments under the GSK Agreements. Under the terms of the Agreement, we are generally entitled to receive 2% royalties on net sales of prophylactic vaccines for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of a resulting GSK product, with some exceptions; however, we have already sold this potential royalty stream in its entirety as discussed in more detail below. The GSK License and Amended GSK Supply Agreements may be terminated by either party upon a material breach if the breach is not cured within the time specified in the respective agreement. The termination or expiration of the GSK License Agreement does not relieve either party from any obligation which accrued prior to the termination or expiration. Among other provisions, the license rights granted to GSK survive expiration of the GSK License Agreement. The license rights and payment obligations of GSK under the Amended GSK Supply Agreement survive termination or expiration, except that GSK's license rights and future royalty obligations do not survive if we terminate due to GSK's material breach unless we elect otherwise.
 QS-21 Stimulon is a key component included in certain of GSK's proprietary adjuvant systems, and we believe that a number of GSK's vaccine candidates currently in development are formulated using adjuvant systems containing QS-21 Stimulon, including its shingles vaccine that was approved by the FDA and Health Canada in 2017. We do not incur clinical development costs for products partnered with GSK.
 In September 2015, we monetized a portion of the royalties associated with the GSK License Agreement to an investor group led by Oberland Capital Management for up to $115.0 million in the form of a non-dilutive royalty transaction. Under the terms of a Note Purchase Agreement with the investor group (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) we received $100.0 million at closing for which the investors had the right to receive 100% of our worldwide royalties under the GSK License Agreement on sales of GSK’s shingles (HZ/su) and malaria (RTS,S) prophylactic vaccine products that contain our QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant to pay down principle and interest. In November 2017 and pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we received an additional $15.0 million in cash from the investors based on the approval of HZ/su by the FDA. Pursuant to the terms of this transaction, we retained the right to receive all royalties from GSK after all principal, interest and other obligations were satisfied under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement also allowed us to buy back the loan and extinguish the notes early under pre-specified terms.
 In January 2018, we sold 100% of all royalties we were entitled to receive from GSK to Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “HCR”) and used the proceeds to extinguish the debt under the Note Purchase Agreement. HCR paid approximately $190.0 million at closing for the royalty rights, of which approximately $161.9 was used to extinguish the prior notes, yielding us approximately $28.0 million in net proceeds. We are also entitled to receive up to $40.35 million in milestone payments from HCR based on sales of GSK’s vaccines as follows: (i) $15.1 million upon reaching $2.0 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2024 and (ii) $25.25 million upon reaching $2.75 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2026. We would owe a reverse milestone payment of approximately $25.9 million to HCR in 2021 if neither of the following sales milestones are achieved: (i) 2019 sales of the GSK vaccines exceed $1.0 billion or (ii) 2020 sales of the GSK vaccines exceed $1.75 billion (the “Rebate Payment”). As part of the transaction, we provided a guaranty for the potential Rebate Payment and secured the obligation with substantially all of our assets pursuant to a security agreement, subject to certain customary exceptions and excluding all assets necessary for AgenTus Therapeutics, Inc.
 Manufacturing
 Manufacturing CPM Antibodies
 In December 2015, Agenus acquired an antibody manufacturing pilot plant in Berkeley, CA from XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), which we refer to as “Agenus West.” A team of former XOMA employees with valuable chemistry, manufacturing and controls experience joined us and continue to operate the facility. In addition, in February 2017, we amended our collaboration with 
 7

Incyte, transferring manufacturing responsibilities for all antibodies under the collaboration to them. This includes antibodies targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target. We have transferred the manufacturing know how to Incyte to support these endeavors and allow Agenus to focus on the manufacture of antibodies for some of our own CPM programs and those of existing and potential third-party collaborators.  Since the acquisition of Agenus West, we have made significant improvements in the plant, and added additional headcount increasing both scale and capacity. The plant is currently providing antibody production for our lead programs.  We aim to utilize our Agenus West pilot plant capabilities to accelerate antibody delivery, improve quality and increase product yield while providing us with greater manufacturing flexibility, all at reduced costs.
 Manufacturing Cancer Vaccines
 We manufacture our cancer vaccine candidates in our Lexington, MA facility.
 Each Prophage vaccine is manufactured using a patient’s own tumor. After the patient undergoes surgery to remove cancerous tumor tissue, the tumor is shipped frozen in a specially designed kit provided by us to our Lexington, Massachusetts facility. Each Prophage vaccine is produced to a specific standard, in a process taking approximately ten hours, after which it undergoes extensive quality testing for approximately two weeks. The turnaround time from the date of surgery to delivery of vaccine is approximately three to four weeks, which generally fits well with the patient’s recovery time from surgery. Once we release the vaccine, it is shipped frozen overnight to the hospital pharmacy or clinician. Prophage vaccines are given as a simple intradermal injection.
 ASV and PSV vaccine candidates are manufactured using HSP70 loaded with synthetic peptide synthesized by approved manufacturers. The sequence of the peptides is determined by sequencing and analysis of patient and tumor DNA and RNA and run through complex algorithms by our bioinformatics group who have specialized knowledge of the attributes required to elicit immune responsiveness. This process takes several weeks, after which the manufactured vaccine undergoes extensive quality testing, including sterility testing, which takes a further two weeks.
 We have established, within a single facility, well-defined, cost efficient vaccine manufacturing under GMPs, including bioanalytical, quality control and quality assurance, logistics, distribution and supply chain management. After manufacturing, Prophage and ASV vaccine candidates are tested and released by our analytical and quality systems staff. The quality control organization performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that the product meets all applicable specifications. Our quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with current GMP (“cGMP”) as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies.
 Our manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent vaccine output. Our quality control and quality assurance staff is similarly trained and evaluated as part of our effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities.
 QS-21 Stimulon
 Except in the case of GSK, we have retained worldwide manufacturing rights for QS-21 Stimulon, and we have the right to subcontract manufacturing for QS-21 Stimulon. In addition, under the terms of our agreement with GSK, upon request by us, GSK is committed to supply certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon to us and our licensees for a fixed period of time.
Intellectual Property Portfolio 
 We seek to protect our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets and know-how, and we currently own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 35 issued United States patents and approximately 120 issued foreign patents. We also own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 30 pending United States patent applications and approximately 125 pending foreign patent applications. We may not have rights in all territories where we may pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates.
  Through various acquisitions, we own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to a number of patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including methods for identifying therapeutic antibodies and product candidates arising out of such entities’ technology platforms. In particular, we own patents and patent applications relating to our Retrocyte Display technology platform, a high throughput antibody expression platform for the identification of fully-human and humanized monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2029 and 2031. We own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including a patent directed to methods for identifying phosphorylated proteins using mass spectrometry. This patent is projected to expire in 2023. We also own patents and patent applications relating to the SECANT® platform, a platform used for the generation of novel monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2028 and 2029. In addition, as we advance our research and development efforts with our institutional and corporate collaborators, we are seeking patent protection for certain newly identified therapeutic antibodies and product candidates. We can provide no assurance that any of our patents, including the patents that we acquired or in-licensed, will have commercial value, or that any of our existing or future patent applications, including the patent applications that were acquired or in-licensed, will result in the issuance of valid and enforceable patents. Our issued patents covering Prophage vaccine and methods of use thereof, alone or in combination with other agents, expired or will expire at various dates between 2015 and 2024. In particular, our issued U.S. patents 
 8

covering Prophage composition of matter expired in 2015. In addition, our issued patents covering QS-21 Stimulon composition of matter expired in 2008. We continue to explore means of extending the life cycle of our patent portfolio. 
 Various patents and patent applications have been exclusively licensed to us by the following entities:
 University of Virginia
 In connection with our acquisition of PhosImmune in December 2015, we obtained exclusive rights to a portfolio of patent applications and one issued patent relating to PTTs under a patent license agreement with the University of Virginia (“UVA”). The UVA license gives us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the PTT technology and an exclusive option to license any further PTT technology arising from ongoing research at UVA until December 2018. Under the license agreement, we will pay low to mid-single digit running royalties on net sales of PTT products, and a modest flat percentage of sublicensing income. In addition, we may be obligated to make milestone payments of up to $2.7 million for each indication of a licensed PTT product to complete clinical trials and achieve certain sales thresholds. The term of the UVA license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires or becomes no longer valid. The UVA license agreement may be terminated as follows: (i) by UVA in connection with our bankruptcy or cessation of business relating to the licensed technology, (ii) by UVA if we commit a material, uncured breach or (iii) by us for our convenience on 180 days written notice. 
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 On December 5, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Switzerland Inc. (formerly known as 4-Antibody AG)(“4-AB”), entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd. (“Ludwig”), which replaced and superseded a prior agreement entered into between the parties in May 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ludwig granted 4-AB an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights of Ludwig and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center arising from the prior agreement to further develop and commercialize GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 antibodies. On January 25, 2016, we and 4-AB entered into a second license agreement with Ludwig, on substantially similar terms, to develop CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies. Pursuant to the December 2014 license agreement, 4-AB made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to Ludwig. The December 2014 license agreement also obligates 4-AB to make potential milestone payments of up to $20.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of licensed GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 products, and potential milestone payments in excess of $80.0 million if such licensed products are approved in multiple jurisdictions, in more than one indication, and certain sales milestones are achieved. Under the January 2016 license agreement, we are obligated to make potential milestone payments of up to $12.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of CTLA-4 and PD-1 licensed products, and potential milestone payments of up to $32.0 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. Under each of these license agreements, we and/or 4-AB will also be obligated to pay low to mid-single digit royalties on all net sales of licensed products during the royalty period, and to pay Ludwig a percentage of any sublicensing income, ranging from a low to mid-double digit percentage depending on various factors. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid a percentage of sublicensing income totaling $2.0 million to Ludwig under the license agreements. The license agreements may each be terminated as follows: (i) by either party if the other party commits a material, uncured breach; (ii) by either party if the other party initiates bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings; or (iii) by 4-AB or us (as applicable) for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The license agreements also contain customary representations and warranties, mutual indemnification, confidentiality and arbitration provisions.
University of Connecticut Health Center
 In May 2001, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Connecticut Health Center (“
UConn”) which was amended in March 2003 and June 2009. Through the license agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to patent rights resulting from inventions discovered under a research agreement that was effective from February 1998 until December 2006. The term of the license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires in 2028 or becomes no longer valid. UConn may terminate the agreement: (1) if, after 30 days written notice for breach, we continue to fail to make any payments due under the license agreement, or (2) we cease to carry on our business related to the patent rights or if we initiate or conduct actions in order to declare bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice. We are required to make royalty payments on any obligations created prior to the effective date of termination of the license agreement. Upon expiration or termination of the license agreement due to breach, we have the right to continue to manufacture and sell products covered under the license agreement which are considered to be works in progress for a period of six months. The license agreement contains aggregate milestone payments of approximately $1.2 million for each product we develop covered by the licensed patent rights. These milestone payments are contingent upon regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, and commercial sales of products. We have also agreed to pay UConn a royalty on the net sales of products covered by the license agreement as well as annual license maintenance fees beginning in May 2006. Royalties otherwise due on the net sales of products covered by the license agreement may be credited against the annual license maintenance fee obligations. Under the March 2003 amendment, we agreed to pay UConn an upfront payment and to make future payments for each patent or patent application with respect to which we exercised our option under the research agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had paid approximately $900,000 to UConn under the license agreement. The license agreement gives us complete discretion over the commercialization of products covered by the licensed patent rights but also requires us to use commercially reasonable diligent efforts to introduce commercial products within and outside the United States. If we fail to meet these diligence requirements, UConn may be able to terminate the license agreement.

Regulatory Compliance
 Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of our investigational product candidates. In the United States, the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical products to rigorous review.
 In order to obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit proof of safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product. In most cases, this proof entails extensive pre-clinical, clinical, and laboratory tests. Before approving a new drug or marketing application, the FDA may also conduct pre-licensing inspections of the company, its contract research organizations and/or its clinical trial sites to ensure that clinical, safety, quality control, and other regulated activities are compliant with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), or Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), for specific non-clinical toxicology studies. The FDA may also require confirmatory trials, post-marketing testing, and extra surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products, or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Once approved, the labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a drug or biologic product must be in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements.
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the sponsor tests the product in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. In Phase 2, in addition to safety, the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
 The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of pre-clinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in the form of a new drug application (“NDA”), or in the case of biologics, a BLA. In a process that can take a year or more, the FDA reviews this application and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the new compound is both safe and effective for a particular indication and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing.
 Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, we must generally obtain approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of international jurisdictions prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those jurisdictions. We are also subject to cGMP, GCP, and GLP compliance obligations and are subject to inspection by international regulatory authorities. International requirements may in some circumstances be more rigorous than U.S. requirements and may require additional investment in manufacturing process development, non-clinical studies, clinical studies, and record-keeping that are not required for U.S. regulatory compliance or approval. The time required to obtain this approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and can also require significant resources in time, money and labor.
 Under the laws of the United States, the countries of the European Union and other nations, we and the institutions where we sponsor research are subject to obligations to ensure the protection of personal information of human subjects participating in our clinical trials. We have instituted procedures that we believe will enable us to comply with these requirements and the contractual requirements of our data sources. The laws and regulations in this area are evolving, and further regulation, if adopted, could affect the timing and the cost of future clinical development activities.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, various radioactive compounds, and for some experiments we use recombinant DNA. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by local, state, and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. We conduct our activities in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.
 Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products for the treatment of cancer.
 Many competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, and technical resources, and more experience in research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory matters, than we do. Competing companies developing or acquiring rights to more efficacious therapeutic products for the same diseases we are targeting, or which offer significantly lower costs of treatment, could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete. See Part I-Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks 
 10

Related to our Business-Our competitors may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources.”
 Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research institutions conduct significant amounts of research in biotechnology, medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting and retaining skilled scientific talent.
 The CPM landscape is crowded with several competitors developing assets against a number of targets. Development plans are spread out across various indications and lines of therapy, either alone or in combination with other assets. Competitors range from small cap to large cap companies, with assets in pre-clinical or clinical stages of development. Therefore, the landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. We and our partners have CPM antibody programs currently in clinical stage development targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, GITR and OX40. We are aware of many companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed to the same biological targets as these programs, including, without limitation, the following: (1) Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS”) markets ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and is developing agonists to GITR and OX-40, (2) Merck has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody in the United States, as well as an anti-CTLA-4 antagonist and an anti-GITR agonist in clinical development, (3) Ono Pharmaceuticals has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody in Japan, (4) AstraZeneca has an approved anti PD-L1 antibody, as well as anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, GITR and OX40 targeting antibodies in development, (5) Pfizer has an approved anti-PD-L1 (with Merck KgaA) as well as anti-PD-1, and anti-OX40 antibodies in clinical development, (6) Novartis has anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies in clinical trials, and (7) Roche/Genentech has an approved anti-PD-L1 antibody. We are also aware of other competitors with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in clinical development, including AbbVie, Arcus Biosciences, Boehringer Ingelheim, Tesaro, Beigene, Regeneron, Eli Lilly, Jiangsu HengRui Medicine, Shanghai Junshi, Macrogenics, CytomX, Janssen, CBT Pharmaceuticals, Checkpoint Therapeutics, CStone Pharmaceuticals, Livzon MabPharm Inc and Suzhou Alphamab. We are also aware of competitors with pre-clinical antibodies against these targets. In addition, we are also aware of competitors with clinical stage antibodies against targets in our earlier stage programs such as TIM-3, LAG-3, CD137, TIGIT and other undisclosed targets. These include, but are not limited to, BMS, Pfizer, Novartis, Merck, Roche, Tesaro, Eli Lilly, OncoMed, Boehringer Ingelheim, Astellas and Regeneron. Additionally, we are also aware of competitors with assets against these targets that are in pre-clinical development. There is no guarantee that our antibody product candidates will be able to compete with our competitors’ antibody products and product candidates. 
 We are planning to advance combinations of our anti-CTLA-4 antibody, AGEN1884, with Keytruda in 1L NSCLC, where Keytruda is currently approved. Specifically, we will be evaluating efficacy within a subset of patients who express ≥50% PD-L1 protein biomarker levels. We are aware of competitors who have approved immunotherapy products in this indication, including having a label specifically directed at this patient subset, such as Merck (anti-PD-1 monotherapy). We are also aware of industry sponsored clinical trials, including exploratory studies, that are directed at this specific patient population. These include, but are not restricted to, Incyte/Merck (anti-IDO + anti-PD-1), Merck (anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4), Regeneron (anti-PD-1), Roche (anti-PD-L1), Merck KgaA / Pfizer (anti-PD-L1), and Tesaro (anti-PARP + anti-PD-1). We are also aware of competitors who have approved immunotherapies or have published positive Phase 3 data for immunotherapies in 1L NSCLC. These include, and are not restricted to, Merck, BMS, and Roche. Additional competitors have ongoing clinical trials for immunotherapies in the 1L NSCLC setting, across PD-L1 expression levels.
 We are planning to develop our anti PD-1 antibody in second line cervical cancer. We are aware of industry sponsored clinical trials, including exploratory studies that are underway in cervical cancer. Our competitors include, but are not restricted to, Regeneron (anti-PD-1), Merck (anti-PD-1), Ono Pharmaceuticals and BMS (anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-LAG-3 or anti-IDO), Advaxis (HPV targeting vaccine alone or in combination with AstraZeneca’s anti-PD-L1 antibody or BMS’ anti-PD-1 antibody) and Lion Biotechnologies (autologous TILs). We are also aware that Advaxis has submitted a conditional Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for its HPV targeting vaccine in the European Union. Additionally, we are also aware of other early stage clinical trials testing alternate CPM targets in cervical cancer patients. These include, but are not restricted to, OX40 +/- CD137 agonists (Pfizer) and anti-PD-1 + anti-ICOS (GSK/Merck).
 We have autologous vaccine programs in development including our Prophage vaccine in clinical development for GBM and our neo-antigen based AutoSynVax vaccine in clinical development. We are aware of many companies pursuing personalized cancer vaccines in pre-clinical or clinical development, including, without limitation, the following: Aduro Biotech, Neon Therapeutics, Gritstone Oncology, Advaxis/Amgen, BioNTech, Moderna/Merck, Genocea Biosciences, Argos Therapeutics, EpiVax Inc. Nouscom, Immatics, EpiVax Inc., Achilles Therapeutics and BrightPath Biotherapeutics. 
 Several companies have products that utilize similar technologies and/or patient-specific medicine techniques that compete with our HSP based vaccines. Schering Corporation, a subsidiary of Merck, markets temozolomide for treatment of patients with ndGBM and refractory astrocytoma. Other companies are developing vaccines for the treatment of patients with ndGBM, including but not limited to Northwest Biotherapeutics (DC-Vax), Mimivax Inc. (SurVaxM) and Annias Immunotherapeutics (CMV Vaccine). Other companies may begin development programs as well.

To the extent we develop our vaccines in other indications or in combination with other product candidates, such as available standard of care agents (Avastin®), or with CPMs, they could face additional competition in those indications or in those combinations. In addition, and prior to regulatory approval, if ever, our vaccines and our other product candidates may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer and infectious disease therapies continue to accelerate.
 We are aware of compounds that claim to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon that are being used in clinical trials. Several other vaccine adjuvants are in development and could compete with QS-21 Stimulon for inclusion in vaccines in development. These adjuvants include, but are not limited to, (1) oligonucleotides, under development by Pfizer, Idera, and Dynavax, (2) MF59, under development by Novartis, (3) IC31, under development by Intercell (now part of Valneva), and (4) MPL, under development by GSK. In the past, we have provided QS-21 Stimulon to other entities under materials transfer arrangements. In at least one instance, it is possible that this material was used unlawfully to develop synthetic formulations and/or derivatives of QS-21. In addition, companies such as Adjuvance Technologies, Inc., CSL Limited, and Novavax, Inc., as well as academic institutions and manufacturers of saponin extracts, are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. These sources may be competitive to our ability to execute future partnering and licensing arrangements involving QS-21 Stimulon. The existence of products developed by these and other competitors, or other products of which we are not aware, or which other companies may develop in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed or sold using QS-21 Stimulon.
 We are also aware of a third party that manufactures pre-clinical material purporting to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon. The claims being made by this third party may create marketplace confusion and have an adverse effect on the goodwill generated by us and our partners with respect to QS-21 Stimulon. Any diminution of this goodwill may have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize future products, if any, incorporating this technology, either alone or with a third party.
