General
The Children’s Place, Inc. is the largest pure-play children’s specialty apparel retailer in North America. We design, contract to manufacture, sell at retail and wholesale, and license to sell trend right, high quality merchandise predominantly at value prices, primarily under our proprietary “The Children’s Place”, “Place”, “Baby Place”, “Gymboree”, and “Sugar & Jade” brand names. Our physical stores offer a friendly and convenient shopping environment, segmented into departments that serve the wardrobe needs of girls and boys (sizes 4-18), toddler girls and boys (sizes 6 months-5T), and baby (sizes 0-24 months). Our merchandise is also available online at www.childrensplace.com, www.gymboree.com, and www.sugarandjade.com. Our customers are able to shop online for the same merchandise available in our physical stores, in addition to certain merchandise which is exclusive to our e-commerce sites.
The Children’s Place was founded in 1969. The Company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 1997. As of January 29, 2022, we operated 672 stores throughout North America, as well as our online stores. During Fiscal 2021, we opened one store and closed 78 stores. During Fiscal 2020, we opened three stores and closed 178 stores. 
 Jane Elfers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, established several key strategic initiatives:
1.Superior Product - Product is our number one priority. We are focused on providing the right product, in the right channels of distribution, at the right time. We offer a full line of apparel, footwear and accessories so busy moms can quickly and easily put together head-to-toe outfits. Our design, merchandising, sourcing, and planning teams strive to ensure that our product is trend right, while at the same time balancing fashion and fashion basics with more frequent, wear-now deliveries. We reintroduced the Gymboree brand in February 2020 on an enhanced Gymboree website and in certain co-branded locations in Company stores in the U.S. and Canada, and in November 2021, we introduced our new brand, Sugar & Jade, which is targeted at the girls’ “tween” market and is offered exclusively online.
2.Digital Transformation - The transformation of our digital capabilities continues to expand with the development of completely redesigned responsive sites and mobile applications, providing an online shopping experience geared toward the needs of our “on-the-go” customers, expanded customer personalization, which delivers unique, relevant content designed to drive sales, loyalty and retention, and the ability to have our entire store fleet equipped with ship-from-store capabilities. Also, in response to increased digital demand, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has continued to increase the utilization of its third-party logistics provider to further support both our U.S. and Canadian e-commerce operations.
3.Fleet Optimization - As a result of the heightened demand for online purchasing, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our planned store closures under our fleet optimization initiative and have closed 256 stores, against our original target of 300 stores, over the past two fiscal years, including the 78 stores closed during Fiscal 2021. We have closed 527 stores since the announcement of this initiative in 2013. We are targeting 40 retail store closures in Fiscal 2022, which would bring our total store closures since the fleet optimization initiative began to 567 stores.
Overlaying these strategic initiatives is talent. Talent ultimately defines our success, and, over the past several years, we have built a best-in-class management team. We believe that our talented team is a significant competitive advantage for our Company.
Underlying these growth initiatives is a commitment to operational excellence. The Company’s commitment to operational excellence includes disciplined expense management and a focus on ongoing improvement in store and e-commerce operations, and combined with our finance, human resources, compliance and legal areas, form the strong base necessary to support our long-term growth initiatives.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to significantly impact regions all around the world, including the United States and Canada. This has resulted in continuing restrictions of businesses and other activities implemented by national, state, and local authorities and private entities, leading to significant adverse economic conditions and business and lifestyle disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial and retail markets. Federal, state, and local governments and health officials worldwide continue to impose varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as travel bans, restrictions on public gatherings, forced closures of businesses and other activities, social distancing, and the adoption of remote or hybrid learning models for schools, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. In addition, certain U.S. and Canadian mall owners continue to restrict hours of operation and the number of people permitted in stores. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic and consumer spending on discretionary items.
As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to experience business disruption with many of our retail stores across the U.S. and Canada. As of January 29, 2022, all of our stores were open to the public in the U.S., Canada, 
and Puerto Rico. Our distribution centers have remained open and operating during the pandemic to support our retail stores and e-commerce business.
Segment Reporting
In accordance with FASB ASC 280—Segment Reporting, we report segment data based on geography: The Children’s Place U.S. and The Children’s Place International. Each segment includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com, www.gymboree.com, and www.sugarandjade.com. Included in The Children’s Place U.S. segment are our U.S. and Puerto Rico-based stores and revenue from our U.S.-based wholesale business. Included in The Children’s Place International segment are our Canadian-based stores, revenue from our Canadian-based wholesale business, as well as revenue from international franchisees. We measure our segment profitability based on operating income, defined as income before interest and taxes. Net sales and direct costs are recorded by each segment. Certain inventory procurement functions such as production and design, as well as corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, real estate, human resources, legal, and information technology services, are managed by The Children’s Place U.S. segment. Expenses related to these functions, including depreciation and amortization, are allocated to The Children’s Place International segment based primarily on net sales. The assets related to these functions are not allocated. We periodically review these allocations and adjust them based upon changes in business circumstances. Net sales to external customers are derived from merchandise sales, and we have no customers that individually account for more than 10% of our net sales. The following tables show, by segment, our net sales and operating income for the past three fiscal years and total assets as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021:

Key Capabilities
Our objective is to sell high quality, value priced, trend right children’s merchandise. Our merchandise assortment offers one stop shopping across apparel, footwear, and accessories.
Merchandising Strategy
Our merchandising strategy delivers a compelling and coordinated assortment of apparel, footwear, and accessories that facilitate the purchase of head-to-toe outfits. We merchandise our deliveries by season and flow new product to stores monthly.
High Quality and Value 
We believe that offering high quality, value priced, trend right apparel, footwear, and accessories under “The Children’s Place”, “Place”, “Baby Place”, “Gymboree”, and “Sugar & Jade” brand names is a competitive advantage. 
Brand Image
We focus on our brand image and strengthening our customer loyalty by:
•Consistently offering high quality and age appropriate products and trend right fashion predominantly at value prices in a friendly and convenient store shopping environment and online;
•Providing coordinated outfits and accessories for our customers’ lifestyle needs;
•Providing exclusive products on our e-commerce sites to expand the breadth of our offerings;
•Creating strong merchandising and visual presentations to create compelling in-store and online experiences; 
•Emphasizing our great value fashion in marketing visuals to convey a consistent message across our brands;
•Leveraging our customer database to communicate with our customers and personalize communications to maximize customer satisfaction, engagement and retention; and
•Utilizing our MyPLACE Loyalty Rewards program and private label credit card to drive customer engagement and retention.
Low-Cost Global Sourcing 
We design, source, and contract to manufacture the substantial majority of the Company’s branded products. We believe that this is essential to assuring the consistency and quality of our merchandise, as well as our ability to deliver value to our customers. We have strong multi-year relationships with the substantial majority of our vendors. Through these relationships and our extensive knowledge of low cost sourcing on a global scale, we are able to offer our customers high-quality products at predominantly value prices. We maintain a network of sourcing offices globally in order to manage our vendors efficiently and respond to changing business needs effectively. Our sourcing offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, and our presence in Asia and Africa and other areas in which we source products, give us access to a wide range of vendors and allow us to work to maintain and/or reduce our merchandise costs by capitalizing on new sourcing opportunities while maintaining our high standard for product quality.
Merchandising Process
The strong collaboration between our cross-functional teams in design, merchandising, sourcing, and planning have enabled us to build our brands. 
Design
The design team gathers information from trends, color services, research, and trade shows. 
Merchandising
Each quarter, we develop seasonal merchandising strategies. 
Planning and Allocation
The planning and allocation organization works collaboratively with the merchandising, finance, and global sourcing teams to develop seasonal sales and margin plans to support our financial objectives and merchandising strategies. Further, this 
team plans the flow of inventory to ensure that we are adequately supporting store floor sets, online demand, and key selling periods.
Production, Quality Assurance, and Responsible Sourcing
During Fiscal 2021, we engaged independent contract vendors located primarily in Asia and Africa. We continue to pursue global sourcing opportunities to support our inventory needs and seek to reduce merchandise costs. We contract for the manufacture of the substantial majority of the products we sell. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. 
During Fiscal 2021, we sourced all of our merchandise directly without the use of third-party commissioned buying agents for our branded product. We source from a diversified network of vendors, purchasing primarily from Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and China. No country accounted for 15% or more of our production. 
In addition to our quality assurance procedures, we conduct a responsible sourcing program that seeks to protect our Company, enhance our brands and address the well-being of the people who make our products by providing guidance in line with industry standards to our vendors in their efforts to provide safe and appropriate working conditions for their employees. These efforts are part of an ongoing process to encourage our vendors to continually assess, and where appropriate, improve factory working conditions, and well-being of their employees who make our product. Additionally, under our responsible sourcing program, we monitor changes in local laws and other conditions (e.g., worker safety, workers’ rights of association, and political and social instability) in the countries from which we source in order to identify and assess potential risks to our sourcing capabilities. 
Environmental, Social & Governance
We published a comprehensive Environment, Social & Governance (“ESG”) Report in November 2021, which is available at http://corporate.childrensplace.com under the ESG tab. This ESG Report includes 22 public goals across our global operations, aligned with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) guidelines for apparel, accessories & footwear, Global Reporting Initiative core standards (“GRI”), and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
In recognition of the increasing importance to our shareholders and other stakeholders of enhanced board oversight of ESG topics, in Fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors directed the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee (previously the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) to formulate a recommendation to the Board of Directors concerning the assignment of oversight responsibilities for ESG topics, including human capital management and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”) matters. Following a comprehensive review and analysis of oversight responsibilities by the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee, in conjunction with governance and legal advisors, the Board of Directors approved the Committee’s recommendations to leverage director skillsets, rename the Committees to better reflect the Committees’ expanded roles, and amend Committee charters to include the enhanced oversight responsibilities.
Previously, oversight of ESG topics resided primarily with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In response to the recommendations made to and approved by the Board of Directors, components of the Company’s ESG activities were assigned between the other two committees, and both of those committees were renamed to better reflect their new oversight responsibilities. Following the reassignment, the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s ESG risk management activities, including environmental initiatives, and social topics such as responsible sourcing in the Company’s global supply chain. This Committee is also charged with the oversight of the Company’s corporate governance policies and practices. Separately, the Human Capital & Compensation Committee has the oversight responsibility for the Company’s human capital management policies and practices, including diversity, equity and inclusion topics and associated risks. The Human Capital & Compensation Committee also is charged with the oversight of the Company’s executive compensation policies, practices and plans, and associated risks.
In terms of environmental initiatives, we believe that purpose-led companies such as ours have the opportunity and responsibility to work to ensure that our business contributes to a healthy planet. We focus on topics that are important to our long-term success and where we believe we can have the most positive impact. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee oversees our environmental initiatives which aim to:
•Reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) in our operations and across our global supply chain through science-based goals to address climate change; 
•Deliver responsibly sourced product offerings through the use of sustainable raw materials;
•Reduce and manage water and chemical usage in manufacturing and processing in our global supply chain; and
•Divert the amount of waste from our operations sent to landfills and move to a more circular system through reusing and recycling.
In designing and implementing our environmental initiatives, we identify areas where we believe we can make a difference and establish quantitative goals in an effort to positively impact the communities and environments affected by our business. To have the greatest impact, we collaborate with experts, non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”), other non-profit organizations, industry peers, and third-party vendors and factories to identify and implement initiatives. The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability & Governance Committee oversees our commitment to a long-term approach across our global operations to act responsibly and efficiently. 
In terms of social initiatives, our commitment to positive social practices includes our responsible sourcing activities in our global supply chain, where we partner with our third-party vendors and factories, NGOs and others in supporting workers’ health, safety and well-being. We monitor compliance by our third-party vendors and factories with our Vendor Code of Conduct, local laws and ethical business practices to help ensure fair and safe work conditions for the people who make our products. We also recognize the importance of eliminating forced labor within the supply chain and its increasing significance in light of recent reports of human rights abuses in various regions of the world. In addition, we support and sponsor a number of worker well-being programs designed to improve the daily lives of the predominantly female factory workers who make our products. Our commitment to having a positive social influence also extends to our charitable mission of supporting children and families in need.
Human Capital Management
As of January 29, 2022, we had approximately 11,900 employees, approximately 2,000 of whom were based at our corporate offices and distribution centers. Approximately 1,500 were full-time store employees and approximately 8,400 were part-time and seasonal store employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
The Human Capital & Compensation Committee is actively engaged in overseeing our human capital management strategies, including our talent and succession planning initiatives designed to attract, develop, engage, reward and retain top retail, digital and business leaders, who can drive our financial performance and strategic growth initiatives and contribute to building long-term shareholder value. The Company has benefited greatly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the stability of our senior leadership team, who have an average tenure of over six years, including our CEO who has led the Company for over a decade. The Human Capital & Compensation Committee’s involvement in leadership development and succession planning is systematic and ongoing, culminating in an annual review by the Board of Directors of succession plans for all of our senior leaders, inclusive of development strategies for top talent within the Company. The Company has a strong track record of succession planning and growing talent within the organization with 60% of its senior leadership team promoted into their current role. In addition, during Fiscal 2020, almost 70% of all open corporate roles and over 50% of all field management roles were filled internally.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
In Fiscal 2021, the Board of Directors approved the assignment of oversight responsibilities for human capital management activities and risks, including DE&I, to the Human Capital & Compensation Committee. To improve its understanding of the Company’s culture and talent pipeline, the Board of Directors and its committees periodically meet with high-potential executives in formal and informal settings. More broadly, the Human Capital & Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors are regularly updated on key talent metrics for the overall workforce, including diversity and inclusion, pay equity, employee relations, recruiting and development programs, and overall progress against the Company’s human capital development strategies. Diversity and inclusion are top priorities for the Company, and we actively work to ensure that our workplace includes a range of perspectives and backgrounds at the Board of Directors level, in senior leadership, and throughout our management and associate base. The Company reports annually on employment data, including ethnicity, in line with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) guidelines, publishes its complete EEO-1 data on its corporate website, and continues to focus on building a culture which supports diversity, equity and inclusion, and which works to ensure fair compensation and opportunity for all employees regardless of gender or race.
The Company is female-led and believes that it is positioned to outperform by employing diverse teams operating in an inclusive environment. The Company’s position is enhanced by the diversity of teams across its stores, distribution centers and corporate headquarters, in its senior leadership team, and at the Board of Directors level. As reported in the Company’s ESG Report, 87% of the Company’s associates are women. Over 50% of both the members of our Board of Directors and senior leadership team are women. 87% of new hires and 90% of promotions during Fiscal 2020 were women. Additionally, 64% of our associates identify as racially diverse and associates identifying as racially diverse represented 70% of new hires and 62% of promotions during Fiscal 2020. In addition, the Company is committed to doubling its Black associate population at its corporate headquarters by 2025. The Company seeks to uphold its diverse and inclusive culture by striving to ensure its talent acquisition programs sustain and grow diverse representation across its workforce, promoting talent from within, building an inclusive culture through awareness and education, and rewarding all employees equitably.
For additional information concerning the Company’s environmental initiatives, DE&I initiatives and EEO-1 data, please refer to the Company’s ESG Report, which can be found on the Company’s corporate website at 
http://corporate.childrensplace.com under the ESG section, and the Company’s Proxy Statement for Fiscal 2021.
Company Stores
The following section highlights various store information for The Children’s Place operated stores as of January 29, 2022.
Existing Stores
As of January 29, 2022, we had a total of 672 The Children’s Place stores in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico and our online stores at www.childrensplace.com, www.gymboree.com, and www.sugarandjade.com. In addition, our seven international partners operated 211 international points of distribution in 16 countries. The following table sets forth the number of stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada as of the current and prior fiscal year end:

 | Number of Stores | 
Location | January 29, 2022 | January 30, 2021
United States | 582 | 640 
Canada | 83 | 101 
Puerto Rico | | 
Total Stores | 672 | 749 

At The Children’s Place, our store concepts consist of multiple formats ranging in size from approximately 2,500 to 22,800 square feet, which have evolved over time in response to market trends, and are strategically placed within each market. We try to create an open and brightly lit environment for customers. Our stores typically feature white fixtures to ensure the product is the focal point, using color to brand and create shop identifiers.
Fleet Optimization
We have closed 527 stores, including the 78 stores closed during Fiscal 2021, since the announcement of our fleet optimization initiative in 2013. As a result of the heightened demand for online purchasing, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our planned store closures and closed 256 stores over the past two fiscal years. Since 2013, we have reduced our total store square footage from 5.2 million to 3.2 million. These closures have resulted in improved profitability and operating margin accretion due to sales transfer to surrounding stores and/or e-commerce, low cost of exit, and the elimination of underperforming locations. In markets where we have closed stores, we are seeing the neighboring stores and e-commerce business in the area of the closing become more productive and profitable. These results further our commitment to continue to execute our optimization program.
We continuously review the performance of our store fleet. We base our decisions to open, close, or remodel stores on a variety of factors, including lease terms, landlord negotiations, market dynamics, and projected financial performance. When assessing whether to close a store, we also consider remaining lease life and current financial performance.
E-commerce Sales 
Each of our U.S. and International segments includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com, www.gymboree.com, and www.sugarandjade.com and digital growth remains one of our top strategic priorities. We are committed to delivering a best in class, end-to-end user experience, including product assortment and website operation, fulfillment, and customer service. We are further committed to delivering these experiences to our customers when, where, and how they are looking to access our brands, accounting for cross-channel behavior, growth of mobile devices, and the growing interest in our brands from international consumers. As such, we will continue to make required investments in back-end infrastructure, as well as front-end technology to deliver on this commitment. We believe that the critical investments made in areas such as e-commerce infrastructure and mobile optimization, as well as additional front-end website features, have improved our customer experience.
International Franchisees and Wholesale
We have 211 international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) with seven partners operating in 16 countries. We generate revenues from our franchisees from the sale of products and sales royalties. Our wholesale business includes our relationship with Amazon.
Store Operations
The Children’s Place store operations are organized by geographic region. Our U.S. Vice Presidents and Canada Regional Director oversee a number of district managers residing within each region. We have a centralized corporate store operations function which supports the operations of our stores. Our stores are staffed by store managers and full-time and part-time sales associates, with additional temporary associates hired to support seasonal needs. Our store managers spend a high percentage of their time on the store’s selling floor providing direction, motivation, and development to store associates. To maximize selling productivity, our teams emphasize greeting, replenishment, presentation standards, procedures, and controls. In order to motivate our store management, we offer a monthly incentive compensation plan that awards bonuses for achieving certain financial goals.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal influences, with historically heavier concentrations of sales during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Our first fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, our second and third fiscal quarter results are dependent upon back-to-school sales, and our fourth fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the holiday season. The business is also subject to shifts due to unseasonable weather conditions. As described elsewhere herein, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the foregoing seasonal influences. The following table shows the quarterly distribution, as a percentage of the full year, of net sales and operating income (loss) (results in Fiscal 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the government mandated temporary closure of all of our stores for substantial periods of time during Fiscal 2020):

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Net sales as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2021 | 22.8 | % | | 21.6 | % | 29.1 | % | 26.5 | %
Fiscal 2020 | 16.8 | % | | 24.2 | % | 27.9 | % | 31.1 | %
Operating income (loss) as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2021 | 23.9 | % | | 13.7 | % | 41.3 | % | 21.1 | %
Fiscal 2020 | (86.6) | % | | (32.3) | % | 11.7 | % | 7.2 | %

For more information regarding the seasonality of our business and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quarterly Results and Seasonality.”
Marketing
The Children’s Place and Gymboree are well-recognized brands, with a trend right offering and a compelling value proposition. Our direct marketing program utilizes both on-line and off-line channels. We relaunched the Gymboree brand in February 2020 with a meaningfully improved digital experience on www.gymboree.com, complemented by shop-in-shop locations in certain co-branded stores in the U.S. and Canada, by successfully executing on the specific design, sourcing, and merchandising characteristics that create Gymboree’s elevated, playful collections. Additionally, in November 2021, we introduced our new brand, Sugar & Jade, which is targeted at the girls’ “tween” market and is offered exclusively online.
We have a customer loyalty program and a private label credit card program. At the end of Fiscal 2021, members of our MyPLACE Rewards loyalty program and/or private label credit card program accounted for approximately 75% of sales. Our private label credit card is issued to our customers for use exclusively at The Children’s Place stores and online at www.childrensplace.com, www.gymboree.com, and www.sugarandjade.com, and credit is extended to such customers through a third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis to us. Additionally, in our effort to reach an even wider customer base who are digitally savvy during the COVID-19 pandemic and to utilize other forms of spending arrangements available, we have partnered with Afterpay to allow our customers to purchase our products on a “buy-now-pay-later” program. We promote affinity and loyalty through our marketing programs by utilizing specialized incentive programs. 
Distribution
In the United States, we own and operate a 700,000 square foot distribution center in Alabama, which supports both U.S. retail store operations and U.S. e-commerce operations. In Canada, we lease and operate a 95,000 square foot distribution center in Ontario for our Canadian retail store operations. We also use a third-party provider operating a 694,000 square foot distribution center in Indiana and a 286,000 square foot distribution center in Ontario, Canada to support our U.S. and Canadian 
e-commerce operations, respectively. On occasion, we may utilize additional facilities to support seasonal warehousing needs. We also use a third-party provider of warehousing and logistics services in both Malaysia and China to support our international franchise business. 
Competition
The children’s apparel, footwear, and accessories retail markets are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are specialty stores, mass merchants, and off-price stores, including Target Corporation, Old Navy, GapKids, and babyGap (each of which is a division of The Gap, Inc.), Carter’s, Inc., T.J. Maxx and Marshall’s (each of which is a division of TJX Companies, Inc.), Burlington Coat Factory, Inc., Kohl’s Corporation, Walmart Stores, Inc., and other department stores. We also compete with regional retail chains, catalog companies, and e-commerce retailers. One or more of our competitors are present in substantially all of the areas in which we have stores.
Trademarks and Service Marks
“The Children’s Place”, “Place”, “Baby Place”, “Gymboree”, “Crazy 8”, “Sugar & Jade” and certain other marks have been registered as trademarks and/or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and other foreign countries. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company acquired certain intellectual property and related assets of Gymboree Group, Inc. and related entities (the “Gymboree Assets”), which included the worldwide rights to the names “Gymboree” and “Crazy 8” and other intellectual property, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and customer databases. In November 2021, we launched the Sugar & Jade e-commerce website at www.sugarandjade.com. Registration of our trademarks and the service marks may be renewed to extend the original registration period indefinitely, provided the marks are still in use. We intend to continue to use and protect our trademarks and service marks and maintain their registrations. We have also registered our trademarks in other countries where we source our products and where we have established and possibly may establish franchising operations. We believe our trademarks and service marks have received broad recognition and are of significant value to our business.
