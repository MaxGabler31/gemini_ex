ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Historical Company Information
 We were initially incorporated in 1968 as GolfRounds, Inc., a Florida corporation.  During July 1999, GolfRounds, Inc. was re-domesticated to Delaware through a merger into its wholly-owned subsidiary GolfRounds.com, Inc. Effective May 28, 2014, GolfRounds.com, Inc., amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Fuse Medical, Inc. (“Fuse” or our “Company”) and merged with and into Fuse Medical, LLC, with Fuse Medical, LLC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fuse.  The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. Fuse was the legal acquirer, and Fuse Medical, LLC was deemed the accounting acquirer.  During 2015, certificates of termination were filed for Fuse Medical, LLC and its two subsidiaries.  
 Change-in-Control
 Since December of 2016, we have been controlled by two primary stockholders: NC 143 Family Holdings, LP, a family limited partnership controlled by Mark W. Brooks (“NC 143”), our Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and President; and Reeg Medical Industries, Inc. (“RMI”, and together with NC 143, the “Investors”), an investment holding company owned and controlled by Christopher C. Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary.
 On December 19, 2016 (the “Change-in-Control Date”), we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between the Investors and our Company, pursuant to which NC 143 acquired 5 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), for a purchase price of $400,000 and RMI acquired 4 million shares of our Common Stock for a purchase price of $320,000 (collectively the “Investor Shares”), effective as of the Change-in-Control Date.
 The closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement resulted in a change-in-control of our Company whereby the Investors beneficially acquired approximately 61.4% of our Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after the Change-in-Control Date. Mark W. Brooks became our Chairman of the Board and Christopher C. Reeg became our Chief Executive Officer, as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on December 23, 2016, which is herein incorporated by reference.   
 
CPM Acquisition
 On December 15, 2017, we entered into an agreement with NC 143 pursuant to which we would purchase all of the outstanding membership interests of CPM Medical Consultants, LLC (“CPM”) as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated December 19, 2017, with the SEC (the “CPM Acquisition Agreement”), which is herein incorporated by reference (such transaction, the “CPM Acquisition”).
 On December 29, 2017, we completed the previously-announced CPM Acquisition, pursuant to the CPM Acquisition Agreement. We issued 50 million shares of our Common Stock in exchange for 100% of the outstanding membership interests of CPM, at an agreed-upon value of $0.20 per share of Common Stock, as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed January 5, 2018, and amended by our Current Report on Form 8-K/A, dated March 12, 2018, which are both herein incorporated by reference. The effective date of the CPM Acquisition was December 31, 2017 (the “Effective Date”).  
 On the Effective Date and following the closing of the CPM Acquisition, NC 143 and RMI beneficially held approximately 90.4% of our Common Stock outstanding and Common Stock from convertible promissory notes if converted – as more fully described in “Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” contained in this 2017 Annual Report.
 In the CPM Acquisition, Fuse was the legal acquirer and, for accounting purposes, CPM was deemed to have acquired Fuse. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2017 (this “2017 Annual Report”) reflects CPM as the reporting entity for 2017 and 2016 and is consolidated with Fuse from and effective on the Change-in-Control Date.
 We are a “smaller reporting company” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Accordingly, this 2017 Annual Report will reflect the reporting requirements of smaller reporting companies as set forth in Regulation S-K, promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 Overview
 
We are a national distributor of medical devices, providing a broad portfolio of orthopedic implants including: (i) internal and external fixation products; (ii) upper and lower extremity plating and total joint reconstruction implants; (iii) soft tissue fixation and augmentation for sports medicine procedures; (iv) full spinal implants for trauma, degenerative disc disease, and deformity indications (collectively, “Orthopedic Implants”); and (v) a wide array of osteo-biologics and regenerative tissue which include human allografts,

substitute bone materials, tendons, and regenerative tissues and fluids (“Biologics”). All of our medical devices are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for sale in the United States, and all of our Biologics suppliers are licensed tissue banks accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”).
 We believe our broad portfolio of Orthopedic Implants and Biologics provide high-quality products to assist surgeons with positive patient outcomes and cost-effective solutions for our customers, which include hospitals, medical facilities, and sub-distributors. We operate under exclusive and non-exclusive agreements with our vendors and supply partners in the geographic territories that we serve.
 We pride ourselves on developing strong and collaborative supplier relationships, resulting in strong long-term partnerships with broad diversification.  Currently we maintain relationships with approximately 51 different suppliers, with our top five suppliers representing approximately 32% of our consolidated cost of revenue and our top ten suppliers representing more than 50% of our consolidated cost of revenues.
 One of our Biologics suppliers is Vivex Biomedical, Inc., a biomedical company, focused on cellular therapies that treat orthopedic, spine, wound, and soft tissue indications. OrthoSolutions Group Ltd. and Vilex in Tennessee, Inc. are two of our suppliers of Orthopedic Implants for lower extremities as well as FH Orthopedics, Inc. for shoulder replacement systems. Two of our other suppliers are Precision Spine, Inc. and Spinal Elements, Inc. for medical devices used in spine surgeries. We also have an agreement dated November 1, 2016, with Tyber Medical, LLC, a manufacturer of Orthopedic Implants, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.13, to develop and expand our private label initiatives.  
 We continuously review and expand our product lines to ensure we offer the most comprehensive, high-quality, and cost-effective selection of Orthopedic Implants and Biologics so that we can meet and exceed our customers’ needs while continuing to grow our existing customer base.
 We are currently negotiating new stocking distribution agreements with two manufacturing companies for non-exclusive distribution rights in the United States for their total knee and total hip replacement systems. We are also evaluating the opportunity to license those manufacturing companies’ technology for our own branding opportunities.
 We utilize our physical relationships, corporate partners, facility contracts and distribution channels, as well as their knowledge of the healthcare industry to further our business objectives and believe all sales are generated with transparency and the highest ethical standards. We continue to build our network of surgeons in select clinical specialties, many of whom we believe are leaders in their respective fields. These medical leaders and specialists may include the heads of teaching hospitals and universities, clinical residency programs, and clinical fellowship programs at some of the most respected institutions in the nation. We are currently in the process of creating product line advisory boards whereby these industry leaders will provide us with valuable insight to further our product development.
 Product Distribution Channels and Customer Base
 We utilize multiple distribution models including direct sales representatives and independent contractors. Our largest customers are hospitals and surgical facilities. We primarily resell products that we acquire directly from large medical device manufacturers or from authorized distributors. Our sales to hospitals and surgical facilities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 62% and 71%, respectively. Our sales to distributors on a wholesale basis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 38% and 27%, respectively.
Competition
 We primarily compete with large, vertically-integrated medical device manufactures that enjoy well-established distribution channels, national sales networks, direct sales models, and participation in large group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) contracted with major hospitals and surgery centers. Our competitors incentivize physicians, surgeons, and specialists’ opportunities through consulting agreements, clinical trials remuneration, royalties, and other compensation models.
 Generally, we view Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew, and Orthofix International, N.V., as examples of our vertically-integrated competitors. We believe our competitors, and companies like them, only distribute products they manufacture and have significant costs related to research and development and organizational support. On the other hand, we sell many manufacturers’ products and have no costs related to research and development, nor do we have similar costs for organizational support, because we are not vertically-integrated. Thus, we believe that our competitive advantage lies primarily with our single-source fulfillment sales model, allowing us to offer a broader assortment of several manufacturers’ products. Furthermore, without significant costs associated with research and development or organizational support, we believe that the compensation packages we offer to our sales team have higher-earning potentials than the compensation packages our competitors offer, allow us to attract and retain talented employees.
 We partner primarily with small- and medium-sized manufacturers of Orthopedic Implants that are subject to FDA compliance and approval standards. These manufacturers are highly innovative and cost effective because of their streamlined sales infrastructures.

Because of our organizational structure and our sales model, we tend to align well with our suppliers’ competitive strategies, meaning they will partner with us over a competitor. Moreover, we believe that many of the large manufacturers of Orthopedic Implants have patents that have expired or will soon expire on types of products we currently distribute or anticipate distributing. As a result, we believe those products will cease to carry a premium and will become commoditized. We believe that expiration of these patents and resulting commoditization will create significant opportunities for us to become a go-to distributor for these products at a lower price point than is currently available on the market.
 The market in which we operate is sensitive to changes in third-party and government reimbursements and to a lesser degree competitive discount pricing. We believe that our industry will see increased consolidation because the market is significantly fragmented with numerous medical device distributors offering similar product portfolios throughout the United States. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property includes trademarks pending for our private label portfolio, trade secrets, and intellectual property licenses arising out of our distribution agreements (“IP”). Our private label portfolio consists of (i) our amniotic membrane line that includes AmBioChoice and AmBioChoice Plus; (ii) our internal fixation product line that includes small bone screws; and (iii) our cervical and lumbar spinal implant line. We have applied for trademarks on our AmBioChoice and AmBioChoice Plus products. We are pursuing intellectual property license and purchase agreements to secure additional intellectual property for our use. Although we have not entered into any material agreements to date for the purchase or license of intellectual property, we believe that in the next calendar year we will identify and acquire viable intellectual property for use in our business. We also maintain stocking distribution agreements providing for exclusive distribution rights in certain geographic areas and use of associated trademarks, service marks, and tradenames for the sale and promotion of the products we offer, which generally have terms of one year, subject to renewal terms. Furthermore, we require leased employees, independent contractors, consultants, and advisors to execute assignment agreements that assign to us the IP existing and generated from their work. We believe our IP and exclusive distribution agreements provide us with important competitive advantages by (a) increasing our brand awareness and the brand awareness of the products we distribute; and (b) insuring that we use the latest design and manufacturing technology for our products.

Regulatory Issues
 Our business is subject to highly complex United States federal and state regulations that may impact our ability to fully implement our strategic plans and initiatives. We are required to obtain and hold licenses and permits and to comply with the regulatory requirements of various governmental agencies. If we fail to comply with such regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply with such regulations, the economic viability of our Company may be adversely affected.
 FDA Regulations
 The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal governmental agencies, and state authorities. These laws and regulations govern the approval of, clearance of, or license to commercialize Orthopedic Implants and Biologics, including compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, and sales of the products, record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections, and recalls and other matters. As a distributor and marketer of such FDA-regulated products, we may be subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products. We may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with requirements that apply to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with those applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as fines and civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecutions. To support our Biologic product lines, we are a registered establishment with the FDA for the storage and distribution of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps).
 Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 We are required to comply with federal and state laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Such healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to the relationships that we and our distributors have with healthcare professionals and entities (such as physicians and hospitals). The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations, substantial fines, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal sanctions. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect the economic viability of our Company.
Employees
 Effective January 1, 2017, we engaged AmBio Staffing, LLC (“AmBio”) a Texas licensed Professional Employment Organization, (“PEO”) to provide us with payroll processing, employee benefit administration, and related human capital services. Our Chairman of the Board and President, Mark Brooks, owns and controls AmBio. As of March 26, 2018, AmBio supports approximately 74 full time equivalents (“FTE”). Of those 72 FTEs, 42 FTEs directly support us, 19 FTEs support the operations of other companies, and we share 13 FTEs with other companies.
