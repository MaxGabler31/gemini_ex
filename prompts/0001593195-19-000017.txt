Item 1. Business
Overview
Tribune Publishing Company, formerly tronc, Inc., was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2013. Tribune Publishing Company together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Tribune”) is a media company rooted in award-winning journalism. Headquartered in Chicago, Tribune operates local media businesses in eight markets with titles including the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, The Baltimore Sun, Orlando Sentinel, South Florida’s Sun Sentinel, Virginia’s Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot, The Morning Call of Lehigh Valley Pennsylvania and the Hartford Courant. Tribune also operates Tribune Content Agency and on February 6, 2018, the Company became a majority owner of BestReviews LLC (“BestReviews”). On May 28, 2018, the Company acquired Virginian-Pilot Media Companies LLC, owner of The Virginian-Pilot, a daily newspaper based in Norfolk, Virginia, and associated businesses (“Virginian-Pilot”). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on acquisitions.
On May 23, 2018, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of forsalebyowner.com and on June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and various other titles of the Company’s California properties (“California Properties”). See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on dispositions and related discontinued operations.
Effective October 9, 2018, the Company changed its corporate name from tronc, Inc. to Tribune Publishing Company. The common stock of the Company began trading the morning of October 10, 2018 on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “TPCO.”
Tribune’s continuing legacy of brands, including The Virginian-Pilot, have earned a combined 60 Pulitzer Prizes and are committed to informing, inspiring and engaging local communities. Tribune’s brands create and distribute content across its media portfolio, offering integrated marketing, media and business services to consumers and advertisers, including digital solutions and advertising opportunities.
The Company’s results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the seasonality of Tribune’s revenues. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter revenues. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season.

In the first quarter of 2018, the U.S. imposed preliminary tariffs on certain Canadian newsprint suppliers and the Company’s newsprint suppliers raised their prices approximately 23.0% in response. On August 29, 2018, the International Trade Commission reached a negative determination on the tariffs stating that these imports do not cause material harm to the U.S. paper industry. As a result of this final determination, duties submitted in the intervening months will not be collected from the importers of record. Since the final determination, the Company has seen very little effort by newsprint suppliers to rescind price increases, which were wholly or partially due to pending duty and tariff determinations. As a result, the Company may continue to experience high newsprint prices for an undetermined amount of time. Higher newspaper prices may negatively impact profitability and demand for newsprint.
Significant transactions and recent events
On January 29, 2018, the Company and Cars.com, LLC agreed to convert the Company’s affiliate markets into Cars.com's direct retail channel. The agreement, which resulted in more than 2,000 car deal customers moving from the Company to Cars.com, took effect February 1, 2018. The Company’s related sales and support teams joined Cars.com in connection with the transition. The deal also includes a multi-year advertising and marketing agreement between the Company and Cars.com.
On February 6, 2018, the Company acquired a 60% membership interest in BestReviews LLC (“BestReviews”), a company engaged in the business of testing, researching and reviewing consumer products, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement (the “BestReviews Acquisition Agreement”), entered into on the same date among the Company, BestReviews Inc., a Delaware corporation (“BR Parent”), BestReviews and the stockholders of BR Parent named therein. The total purchase price of $68.3 million consisted of $33.7 million in cash, less a post-closing working capital adjustment received from the seller of $0.6 million, and $34.6 million in common stock of the Company. The Company issued 1,913,438 shares of common stock in connection with the closing (the “Stock Consideration”). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the acquisition.
On February 7, 2018, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA”) by and between the Company and Nant Capital, LLC (“Nant Capital”), pursuant to which the Company would sell the California Properties to Nant Capital for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million in cash, plus the assumption of unfunded pension liabilities related to the San Diego Pension Plan, less closing balance sheet and other adjustments totaling $12.6 million, plus a post-closing working capital adjustment received from the buyer of $2.1 million (the "Nant Transaction"). The Nant Transaction closed on June 18, 2018. Dr. Soon-Shiong, a former director of the Company, together with Nant Capital, beneficially own 8,743,619 shares of Tribune common stock, which represented 24.6% of the outstanding shares of Tribune common stock as of December 30, 2018. The gain on sale and operating results of the California Properties are included in discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the disposition.
On December 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with Merrick Ventures LLC (“Merrick Ventures”) and solely for certain sections thereof, Michael W. Ferro, Jr. and Merrick Media, LLC (“Merrick Media”). On March 18, 2018, Mr. Ferro retired from the Company’s Board of Directors. As Mr. Ferro was no longer actively engaged in the business and the Company remained contractually committed for the future payments due under the Consulting Agreement, the Company recognized expense for the full $15.0 million due under the Consulting Agreement. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company amended the Consulting Agreement to reduce the total fees due under the Consulting Agreement by $2.5 million (from $15 million to $12.5 million) and allow the Company to engage Merrick Ventures as its adviser, if it so chooses, but at no additional cost to the Company. If so engaged, the Company would indemnify Merrick Ventures if the Company requests it to meet with third parties. In June 2018, the Company paid the remaining $7.5 million in fees due under the amended Consulting Agreement in connection with the execution of the amendment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Consulting Agreement.
On May 23, 2018, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of forsalebyowner.com, LLC, for $2.5 million in cash, less a post-closing working capital payment to the buyer of $0.1 million. In connection with the sale agreement, the buyer agreed to purchase advertising placements from the Company in an amount equal to at least $4.5 million over a two-year term. The gain on sale and results are included in discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the disposition.

On May 28, 2018, the Company acquired Virginian-Pilot Media Companies, LLC (“Virginian-Pilot”), a company engaged in the ownership and operation of The Virginian-Pilot daily newspaper based in Norfolk, Virginia. The purchase price was $34.0 million less a post-closing working capital adjustment of $0.1 million received from the seller.

The Company also terminated the Senior ABL Facility. As a result of the Senior ABL Facility termination, the Company established $43.9 million of restricted cash for outstanding letters of credit previously secured by the Senior ABL Facility. As a result of the early extinguishment of debt, the Company incurred a $7.7 million loss related to expensing the remaining balance of original issue discount and debt origination fees. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the extinguishment and terminations of the credit facilities.
Segments
Subsequent to the Company’s name change, Tribune renamed its existing segments M and X. The Company manages its business as two distinct segments, M and X. Segment M is comprised of the Company’s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related digital expenses, except digital subscription revenues when bundled with a print subscription. Segment X includes the Company’s digital revenues and related digital expenses from local Tribune websites, third party websites, mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, Tribune Content Agency (“TCA”) and BestReviews.
Segment M
Segment M’s media groups include the Chicago Tribune Media Group, the New York Daily News Media Group, The Baltimore Sun Media Group, the Orlando Sentinel Media Group, the Sun Sentinel Media Group, the Virginia Media Group, the Morning Call Media Group and the Hartford Courant Media Group. The Virginia Media Group includes the Daily Press and the recently acquired The Virginian-Pilot. Tribune’s major daily newspapers have served their respective communities with local, regional, national and international news and information for more than 150 years. The Hartford Courant is the nation’s oldest continuously published newspaper and celebrated its 250th anniversary in October 2014.
In the year ended December 30, 2018, 41.8% of segment M’s operating revenues were derived from advertising. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in published issues of the newspapers and from the delivery of preprinted advertising supplements. Approximately 41.1% of operating revenues for the year ended December 30, 2018 were generated from the sale of newspapers and other owned publications to individual subscribers or to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers. The remaining 17.1% of operating revenues for the year ended December 30, 2018 were generated from the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services and other related activities.
Newspaper print advertising is typically in the form of display, classified or preprint advertising. Advertising and marketing services revenues are comprised of three basic categories: retail, national and classified. Retail is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with the general public. National is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with other businesses. Classified is a type of advertising which is other than display or preprint.
Circulation revenue results from the sale of print editions of newspapers to individual subscribers and the sale of print editions of newspapers to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers.
Other revenues are derived from commercial printing and delivery services provided to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services and other related activities. The Company contracts with a number of national and local newspapers to both print and distribute their respective publications in local markets where it is a newspaper publisher. In some instances where it prints publications, it also manages and procures newsprint, ink and plates on their behalf. These arrangements allow the Company to leverage its investment in infrastructure in those markets that support its own publications. As a result, these arrangements tend to contribute incremental profitability and revenues. The Company currently distributes national newspapers (including The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal) in its local markets under multiple agreements. Additionally, in New York, Chicago and South Florida, the Company provides some or

all of these services to other local publications. To provide delivery services to other newspapers, the Company contracts with independent third party delivery vendors and does not provide such services directly.

Competition 
Each of the Company’s nine major daily newspapers holds a leading market position in their respective designated market areas as determined by Nielsen (“DMA”), and competes for readership and advertising with both local or community newspapers as well as national newspapers and other traditional and web-based media sources. Increasingly, the Company is facing competition from digital platforms that have content, search, aggregation and social media functionalities, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, over-the-top video services, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor, and other media as advertisers adjust their spending based on the perceived value of the audience reached and the cost to reach that audience.  Over time, less competition for advertising dollars is coming from the traditional local, regional and national newspapers.

The competition for advertising dollars comes from local, regional, and national newspapers, digital platforms that have content, search, aggregation and social media functionalities, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor, and other media as advertisers adjust their spending based on the perceived value of the audience reached and the cost to reach that audience.
The secular shift of how content is consumed, including the ubiquity of mobile platforms, has led to increased competition from a wide variety of new digital content offerings, many of which are often free to users. Besides price, variables impacting customer acquisition and retention include the quality and nature of the user experience and the quality of the content offered.
To address the structural shift to digital media, the Company provides editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats - from the printed daily newspaper to leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook, Apple News and Twitter; on smartphones, tablets and e-readers; on websites and blogs; in niche online publications and in e-mail newsletters.
Raw Materials
As a publisher of newspapers, Tribune utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. During 2018, we consumed approximately 123 thousand metric tons of newsprint. The Company currently obtains substantially all of its newsprint under a long-term contract with a national purchasing aggregator who then draws upon Canadian and U.S. based newsprint producers. We believe that our current source of paper supply is adequate. Our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. Newsprint and ink expense accounted for 6.1% of total operating expenses in the year ended December 30, 2018.
Employees
As of December 30, 2018, we had approximately 4,448 full-time and part-time employees, including approximately 1,090 employees represented by various employee unions. We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
Intellectual Property
Currently, our operations are generally not reliant on patents owned by third parties. However, because we operate a large number of websites and mobile applications in high-visibility markets, we do defend patent litigation, from time to time, brought primarily by non-practicing entities, as opposed to marketplace competitors. We have sought patent protection in certain instances; however, we do not consider patents to be material to our business as a whole. Of greater importance to our overall business are the federal, international and state trademark registrations and applications that protect, along with our common law rights, our brands, certain of which are long-standing and well known, such as Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and The Hartford Courant. Generally, the duration of a trademark registration is perpetual if it is renewed on a timely basis and continues to be used properly as a trademark. We also own a large number of copyrights, none of which individually is material to the business. We maintain certain licensing and content sharing relationships with third-party content providers that allow us to produce the particular content mix we provide to our customers in our markets. The Company entered into a number of agreements with Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company (“TCO”), or its subsidiaries that provide for licenses to certain intellectual property, and in particular, we entered into a license agreement with TCO that provides a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for us to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names, including the Tribune name. Other than the foregoing and commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business as a whole.
Available Information
Tribune maintains its corporate website at www.tribpub.com. The Company makes available free of charge on www.tribpub.com this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the Company’s Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to all those reports, all as filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
