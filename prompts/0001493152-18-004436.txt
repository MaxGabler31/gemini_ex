Corporate Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2010 under the name “Redstone Literary Agents, Inc.”. Following incorporation, we commenced the business of representing authors to publishers.
 
Upon the resignation of Mary Wolf as an officer of our company on August 28, 2014, we ceased pursuing the business of representing authors to publishers and sought new business opportunities.
 
In July 2017, we decided to operate a new business of providing services for blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies and incorporated a Nevada subsidiary, AppCoin Innovations (USA) Inc. on August 1, 2017.

Effective August 17, 2017, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, AppCoin Innovations Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name. As a result, we changed our name from “Redstone Literary Agents, Inc.” to “AppCoin Innovations Inc.”.
 
Effective February 14, 2018, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, ICOX Innovations Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name. As a result, we have changed our name from “AppCoin Innovations Inc.” to “ICOX Innovations Inc.”.
 
Recent Developments
 
On October 18, 2017, we entered into a business services agreement with Business Instincts Group Inc. (“BIG”), whereby we retained the services of BIG to provide certain services, including creating, designing and project managing the launching of initial coin offerings for our clients, in consideration for a monthly fee of $35,000 and a signing bonus of $100,000 payable as follows: (i) $50,000 upon closing of up to $750,000 of equity financing and (ii) $50,000 payable on signing of the first client agreement. The agreement continues for a two-year term which will automatically be renewed unless: (i) mutually agreed to by BIG and us, or (ii) written notice of non-renewal is provided by the non-renewing party to the other at least 90 days prior to the end of the term. The agreement may be terminated by either party, without cause, at any time upon the provision of 90 days written notice to the other party. Our chairman, Cameron Chell, is a director, officer and an indirect shareholder of BIG.
 
On November 20, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with WENN Digital Inc. (“WENN”) whereby we provided to WENN a loan in the principal amount of $100,000, which was to be loaned to Ryde GmbH (“Ryde”) by WENN. The principal amount of the loan bears interest at an annual rate of 7% and matures on November 20, 2018. As partial consideration for us agreeing to provide the loan to WENN, WENN agreed to issue to us such number of shares such that we will own 7.5% of the issued and outstanding common stock of WENN after the issuance of WENN’s common stock to founding shareholders of WENN. On January 3, 2018, WENN fully repaid us the principal amount of the loan with accrued interest, being $100,843.83.
 
On December 29, 2017, we entered into a business services agreement with WENN and, on March 19, 2018, we entered into the amendment no. 1 to business services agreement dated as of March 15, 2018 with WENN. Pursuant to the business services agreement, we agreed to provide WENN with the services in connection with WENN’s development of an image rights management and protection platform (the “Platform”) using blockchain technology, including (i) the business development and technical services, (ii) the business launch services and (iii) the post-business launch support services.
 
WENN was created by combining two substantial, existing businesses, Ryde and The WENN Media Group Limited (“WENN Media”). To our knowledge, Ryde and WENN Media have deep big data, blockchain development, copyright legal experience, proven AI-enabled image recognition and a post-licensing platform. We understand that WENN plans to build a sustainable community on the blockchain of the world’s photographers, offering them, among other things: (i) an efficient and cost-effective means to manage, protect and monetize their creative work; (ii) fast and free copyright protection registration; (iii) efficient and fully transparent accounting reporting; (iv) instant payments; and (v) innovative new revenue streams. The stockholders of WENN currently include us, Blockchain Merchant Group, Inc., Business Instincts Group Inc., Ryde, and WENN Media and, upon the closing of its acquisitions of Ryde and WENN Media, are expected to include certain shareholders of those entities.
 
We do not intend to find or make referrals to, or otherwise solicit, or assist in any way in the solicitation of, investors for investment in WENN’s coin offerings, act as a placement agent for the sale of WENN’s coins, or otherwise engage in any activity that would require us to register under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or similar provisions under state law.

The business services agreement with WENN provides that the fees for the services provided in connection with the development and launch of the Platform (the business development and technical services and business launch services) were deemed earned on the date of execution of the business services agreement. We have waived WENN’s requirement to pay the $250,000 fixed fee in connection with the business development and technical services as a concession. We have recognized the business development and technical services fee of $500,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, which WENN paid in January 2018 upon the completion of its first round of pre-ICO fundraising.
 
The fees for the post-business launch support services (the “Monthly Services”) are $35,000 per month and they will be due at the beginning of each month in which the Monthly Services are performed. With respect to the Monthly Services, we have agreed to provide the Monthly Services for one year commencing on the date of the Platform Launch (as defined below), after which the business services agreement and the provision of the Monthly Services will automatically renew for a one year period and can be terminated by either our company or WENN with 30 days’ written notice. “Platform Launch” means the publicized product launch of the Platform to the general public, including the ability of the general public to use Tokens as the primary means of exchange for transactions on the Platform.
 
In addition, the business services agreement with WENN provides that the work fee in the amount of $4,175,000 is deemed earned on March 15, 2018 and the work fee is subject to a Renegotiation Obligation (as defined below). The business services agreement with WENN also provides that the additional fee of rights to receive an aggregate of 20,000,000 Platform tokens or coins (the “Tokens”) pursuant to a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens is also deemed earned on the date of execution of the business services agreement and the additional fee is subject to a Renegotiation Obligation. However, for financial reporting purposes, the work fee and additional fee are deemed earned on the date of the launch of the Platform. If WENN does not raise more than $40 million in connection with its offer and sale for cash of (i) one or more Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (“SAFTs”), which SAFTs will entitle the holders thereof to receive Tokens under certain circumstances, and/or, (ii) Tokens, in the event that WENN determines to offer and sell Tokens in lieu of or in addition to SAFTs in connection with its fundraising efforts (collectively, the “WENN Offering”), prior to May 31, 2018, we will be required to return the work fees and additional fee to WENN and WENN and our company will be required to negotiate in good faith the amount of each of such fee (such requirement to negotiate is referred to herein as the “Renegotiation Obligation”).
 
We have agreed that WENN will not be responsible for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our company in connection with our performance of the services. In addition, we have agreed to pay, and otherwise be financially responsible for (including through the reimbursement of disbursements made by WENN and its affiliates), (i) all legal costs and expenses incurred by WENN, our company and any of their affiliates in connection with the WENN Offering; (ii) all business and travel expenses incurred by WENN, our company and any of their affiliates in connection the WENN Offering; and (iii) all fees and expenses incurred by WENN in connection with its conversion of cryptocurrencies into US dollars in connection with the WENN Offering, including bank, exchange and other similar fees and expenses. WENN will have the right to deduct any such amounts from the fees otherwise payable by it to our company and apply such deducted amounts to the payments to our company.
 
The business services agreement will continue for a period of one year unless earlier terminated by either our company or WENN.
 
Either we or WENN may terminate the business services agreement upon the provision of 30 days’ written notice to the other party. If we provide such notice, WENN may immediately terminate the business services agreement and we will be entitled to no further compensation except for any fees earned prior to the date of the termination. If WENN provides such notice, we may immediately terminate the business services agreement and will be entitled to no further compensation, except for the following lump sum payments: (i) any fees earned to the effective date of termination; and (ii) a lump sum payment of $105,000.

For the purpose of determining our fees earned to the date of the termination in the event that either party terminates the business services agreement, all fees for services in connection with the development and launch of the Platform (the business development and technical services and business launch services) and the additional fee of rights to receive an aggregate of 20,000,000 Tokens are deemed earned on the date of execution of the business services agreement and the work fee is deemed earned as of March 15, 2018. However, the work fees and additional fee are subject to the Renegotiation Obligation. As such, our work fee and additional fee are not determinable or deemed collectible for the financial reporting purposes until the WENN Offering is completed or, if applicable, those fees are renegotiated pursuant to the Renegotiation Obligation.
 
Our chairman and director, Cameron Chell, is a director, officer and an indirect shareholder of Business Instincts Group Inc. which owns 10% of the common stock of WENN and he is also a director, officer and indirect shareholder of Blockchain Merchant Group, Inc. which owns 2.5% of the common stock of WENN and we own 7.5% of the common stock of WENN. Mr. Chell is also a director, chairman and secretary of WENN. Our president, Bruce Elliott, is a former chief marketing officer of WENN.
 
Our first client, WENN, has entered into a licensing partnership agreement with Eastman Kodak Company, which announced the launch of the KODAKOne blockchain platform and KODAKCoin initial coin offering. We are providing the services relating to the KODAKOne blockchain platform and the KODAKCoin initial coin offering pursuant to a business services agreement dated December 29, 2017, as amended as of March 15, 2018 with WENN.
 
Description of Business
 
Overview
 
Our new business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations.
 
A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology which has the potential to bring significant efficiencies to many applications in diversity of fields ranging from global supply chains to financial services and beyond. One of the key promises of blockchains is reduced transaction and networking costs by removing the need for traditional third party intermediaries, such as banks, lawyers, escrow agents, etc. Blockchain is considered a foundational technology.
 
A cryptocurrency is a digital asset – often referred to as a coin or token – that is used as a medium of exchange using cryptography and decentralized control via a blockchain to secure the transaction and to control the creation of additional units of the currency.
 
We anticipate that we will enable companies to focus on their core competencies while providing the necessary resources and expertise to execute a strategy that will enable companies to integrate new blockchain plus cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations. Our plan is to be compensated on a fee-for-services model. We may also accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
 
Our services include strategic planning, project planning and program management, structure development and administration, business plan modelling, customer development, including customer discovery and scoping as well as product commercialization and support, technology development and support, whitepaper preparation, due diligence reporting, governance planning and management.

Blockchain Technology
 
Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Functionally, a blockchain can serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority.
 
Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system and decentralization can be achieved with a blockchain. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records and other records management activities, such as identity management, documenting provenance, digital asset registration and transaction processing.
 
Initial Coin Offerings and Cryptocurrency
 
Initial coin offerings are an important new business tool that facilitates the distribution of a cryptocurrency enabling companies to develop communities in support of their business plans or projects. The community can financially participate in the initial coin offering without the company issuing equity because the community is participating in cryptocurrency via an initial coin offering. By having a structured stake in the company or project, the investors are incentivized to increase the project’s overall value thereby driving the value of the cryptocurrency issued in the initial coin offering. A cryptocurrency is a digital asset – often referred to as a coin or token – that is used as a medium of exchange using cryptography and decentralized control via a blockchain to secure the transaction and to control the creation of additional units of the currency.
 
We may receive fees from initial coin offering proceeds, in a combination of cash and tokens, coins or equity, to the extent permitted under applicable law. We intend to hold cryptocurrencies on our balance sheet and to sell them from time to time via regulated trading exchanges, to the extent permitted under applicable law. We are not involved in the issuance of cryptocurrencies or mining or other related technical cryptocurrency production.

CoinLaunch’s integrated cryptocurrency funding system enables backers to fund various campaigns using a built-in crypto-payment gateway. It also includes an affiliate and referral system that tracks and manages all aspects of the promotion of ICO campaigns. The platform facilitates the payment of referrals using a CoinLaunch Token, which then can be used to purchase ICOs offered on the platform or redeemed for other cryptocurrencies. The platform includes an integrated compliance system that allows for any vetted ICOs to comply with various local regulations, including know-your-client and anti-money laundering regulations.

Only a “list of authorized investors and their Ethereum wallet addresses” can hold ST20 tokens. In order to launch a legally compliant token, Polymath platform brings together issuers, legal delegates, smart contract developers, know-your-client verification, and a decentralized exchange. All transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on product development, marketing and distribution. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire larger market share and develop and offer more competitive products and services. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to develop our business plan. In the face of competition, we may not be successful in sufficient market share to make our business profitable.
 
Intellectual Property and Technology
 
We do not currently own any intellectual property. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, patents, trademark and copyright laws to protect any intellectual property that we create, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights may be protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.
 
We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. In addition, while we are not aware that our services or proprietary rights infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, we may receive notices from third parties asserting that we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights. Any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service stoppages or lead us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements rather than disputing the merits of such claims. An adverse outcome in litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, or require us to cease operating our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
As we have just begun our new business, we have devoted no substantial efforts to research and development within the last two fiscal years.
 
Government Regulation
 
Current and future legislation and rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins or other cryptocurrency is viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoins and other cryptocurrency may not be excluded from the definition of “security” by regulatory rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions, unless an exemption is available, including transacting in bitcoin or cryptocurrency amongst owners, and require registration of trading platforms as “exchanges” such as Coinsquare. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies under the law. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our own account and harm investors.

We intend to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or know your customer rules relating to tokens imposed by the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.
 
Employees
 
As at March 30, 2018, we have two executive officers, Bruce Elliott, who is our president, and Michael Blum, who is our chief financial officer, secretary, and treasurer, and no employees. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We also employ consultants on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of product design and development and other business functions including marketing and accounting. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus.
