ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc. (“the Company” or “SEER”) was originally organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 13, 2002 for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses, under the name of Satellite Organizing Solutions, Inc. (“SOZG”). In January 2008, SOZG changed its name to Strategic Environmental & Energy Resources, Inc., reduced its number of outstanding shares through a reverse stock split and consummated the acquisition of both, REGS, LLC and Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the environmental, waste management and renewable energy industries. SEER currently operates five companies with four offices in the western and mid-western U.S. Through these operating companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed and owned technologies with many customer installations throughout the U.S. Each of the five operating companies, which includes our majority owned entities, is discussed in more detail below.
 
The Company’s domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER’s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously, establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy, waste and water treatment and industrial services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however, is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patent-pending technologies and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable “green gas” capture and sale, compressed natural gas fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical waste destruction. Many of SEER’s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides synergistic services, technologies and products.
 
The Company now owns and manages three operating entities and two entities that have no significant operations to date, as REGS was abandoned during the third fiscal quarter of 2021. References in this report to abandoned or abandonment refer to the Company’s determination not to provide financial support to, or conduct operations in or through, REGS.
 
Subsidiaries 
 
Wholly owned
 
MV, LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies), (“MV”): (operating since 2003) MV designs and sells patented and/or proprietary, dry scrubber solutions for management of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) in biogas, landfill gas, and petroleum processing operations. These system solutions are marketed under the product names H2SPlus™ and OdorFilter™. The markets for these products include landfill operations, agricultural and food product processors, wastewater treatment facilities, and petroleum product refiners. MV also develops and designs proprietary technologies and systems used to condition biogas for use as renewable natural gas (“RNG”), for a number of applications, such as transportation fuel and natural gas pipeline injection.
 
SEER Environmental Materials, LLC (“SEM”): (formed September 2015) is a wholly owned subsidiary established as a materials technology business with the purpose of developing advanced chemical absorbents and catalysts that enhance the capability of biogas produced from, landfill, wastewater treatment operations and agricultural digester operations.

REGS, LLC d/b/a Resource Environmental Group Services (“REGS”): (operated from 1994 to September 2021) previously designed and manufactured environmental systems and provided general industrial cleaning services and waste management consulting to many industry sectors. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company ceased bidding on, and accepting contracts for the services division of its REGS subsidiary. The results from the subsidiary are included in discontinued operations for the years ended 2021 and 2020. No contracts have been uncompleted relating to the services division; therefore, the services division did not have any performance obligations as of December 31, 2020, nor thereafter. After the industrial cleaning services division was discontinued as of 2019, REGS continued with its manufacturing and assembly operations during 2020 and into 2021. These operations consisted primarily of building kilns and related equipment. As of September 2021, the Company wound down REGS, ceased all operations, and abandoned the entity as a subsidiary. REGS operations for the periods reported were included in discontinued operations. Assets and liabilities were stranded and written off in accordance with GAAP; however, the Company cannot provide any assurance as to the treatment of such assets or liabilities or the abandonment by third parties, including governmental authorities.
 
Majority owned
 
Paragon Waste Solutions, LLC (“PWS”): (formed late 2010) PWS is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction technology using a pyrolytic heating process combined with “non-thermal plasma” assisted oxidation. This technique involves gasification of solid waste by heating the waste in a low-oxygen environment, followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in the presence of plasma. The term “non-thermal plasma” refers to a low energy ionized gas that is generated by electrical discharges between two electrodes. This technology, commercially referred to as CoronaLux™, is designed and intended for the “clean” destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste (i.e., hospital “red bag” waste) thereby eliminating the need for costly segregation, transportation, incineration or landfill (with their associated legacy liabilities). PWS is a 54% owned subsidiary.
 
PelleChar, LLC (“PelleChar”): (formed September 2018) owned 51% by SEER. PelleChar has secured third-party pellet manufacturing capabilities from one of the nation’s premier pellet manufacturers. Working closely with Biochar Now, LLC, PelleChar commenced sales in 2019 of its proprietary pellets containing the proven and superior Biochar Now product starting with the landscaping and big agriculture markets. At this time, PelleChar is the only company able to offer a soil amendment pellet containing the Biochar Now product that is produced using the patented pyrolytic process. PelleChar activity to date relates to startup of operations, and an increasing sales effort. Revenue and expenses of PelleChar were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Joint Ventures
 
PWS MWS Joint Venture: In October 2014, PWS and Medical Waste Services, LLC (“MWS”) formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology. In 2015, MWS licensed and installed a CoronaLux™ unit at an MWS facility, and subsequently received a limited permit to operate from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”) and the California Department of Public Health. In November 2017, PWS received final air quality permit approval from SCAQMD allowing for full operations of the CoronaLux™ unit at the MWS facility.
 
Paragon Southwest Joint Venture: In December 2017, PWS and GulfWest Waste Solutions, LLC (“GWWS”) formed Paragon Southwest Medical Waste, LLC (“PSMW”) to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology. PSMW has an exclusive license to the CoronaLux™ technology in a six-state area of the Southern United States. In addition to the equity position, PWS is the operating partner for the business and intends to sell a number of additional systems to the joint venture. In 2017, PSMW purchased and installed three CoronaLux™ units at an PSMW facility.

Segment Information
 
The Company currently has identified three segments as follows:
 

 | | % of Annual Revenues | 
-----------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+---
 | | 2021 | | | 2020
MV, SEM, PelleChar | Environmental Solutions | | 93 | % | | 92 | %
PWS | Solid Waste | | | % | | | %

 
Reach is not currently operating but should operations commence it will be part of the Environmental Solutions segment. The MV RCM Joint Venture is not currently operating but should operations commence it will be part of the Environmental Solutions segment.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had three customers who comprised 10% or more of our accounts receivable and had a balance of approximately $295,900. As of December 31, 2020, we had one customer who comprised 10% or more of our accounts receivable and had a balance of approximately $229,100. See Item 1A Risk Factors.
 
Financial Condition
 
As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $29.4 million as of December 31, 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income, from continuing operations of $0.2 million, and 2020, we incurred net losses, from continuing operations, of approximately $2.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020 our current liabilities exceed our current assets by approximately $7.5 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The primary reason for that working capital deficit decreased from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, is due to the abandonment of REGS as an entity, and stranded a net of liabilities that are no longer consolidated liabilities under the Company. The Company has limited shares of authorized and unissued common stock available for issue which may limit the ability to raise capital or settle debt through issuance of shares. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue to operate as a going concern for a period of at least one year after the date of the issuance of our audited financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2021.
 
Realization of a major portion of our assets as of December 31, 2021, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies, diversifying our service customer base and market concentrations and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions, including discontinuing a line of business with insufficient margins. Our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate through our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux™ waste destruction units will be critical to achieving profitability. We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding domestic markets attributable to increased federal and state emission control regulations (particularly in the nation’s oil and gas fields) and a growing demand for energy conservation and renewable energies. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing that may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. Our financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.
 
Industry
 
With its diverse services, technologies, and environmental solution offerings, SEER participates in the worldwide markets of environmental compliance, renewable energy and gaseous and solid waste minimization/management. There are ever-increasing emissions and solid waste regulations, as well as statutory programs at the local, state, federal and international levels that create and mandate the need for renewable energies and waste minimization, proper handling, storage, treatment and disposal of virtually all types of waste.

The industrial waste management industry in North America was shaped first by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), which requires waste generators to, among other things, transport, treat, store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations. After RCRA, growing national awareness of environmental issues, coupled with corporate and institutional awareness of environmental liabilities, have contributed to the growth of the industry and associated governing legislation on the state and federal levels.
 
Today, collection and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes are subject to local, state, and federal requirements and controls that regulate health, safety, the environment, zoning and land-use. Included in these regulations is the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), of the United States. CERCLA holds generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of sites where there has been a hazardous release, strictly, jointly and severally liable for environmental cleanup costs resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous materials.
 
The enactment of the federal Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA) resulted in a major shift in the federal government’s role in air pollution control. This legislation authorized the development of comprehensive federal and state regulations to limit emissions from both stationary (industrial) sources and mobile sources. The Act has been amended and expanded in scope many times since its enactment and remains a major consideration for safely and responsibly conducting business in the U.S.
 
These and countless other similar regulatory programs mandate the need for environmental services and technologies such as those offered by SEER and its companies.
 
There are substantial barriers to entry in the waste management industry, including the high degree of expertise and training required, regulatory compliance, insurance, and licensing costs and procedures, strict federal, state, provincial and local permitting and oversight processes, and significant capital costs of equipment and qualified personnel.
 
Business Strategy
 
SEER’s operations to date have been fueled by a combination of synergistic and vertical integration, acquisitions, strategic alliances and organic growth. SEER acquired MV as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2015 SEM was created to provide recurring and high-margin revenue to the Company by offering an internal source of diverse media solutions required to treat various waste and off-gas streams, particularly digesters and landfills. This enables pricing flexibility by the technology solutions affiliates that, in turn, should result in increased sales of systems that leads to greater demand for media. We intend to continue pursuing an aggressive strategy of both acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and organic growth while expanding our geographic footprint into other regions of the United States and foreign markets. Potential acquisitions may include businesses that secure supply chain and vendor logistics or complement our core businesses or companies that provide a similar set of services in regions where the Company does not currently have operations.
 
Upon full development of certain patented and patent-pending technologies, we intend to explore licensing relationships with larger, established companies to generate sustainable revenue streams from domestic and international applications.

Intellectual Property
 
MV was issued a patent in 2012 related to “Oil-Gas Vapor Collection, Storage, and Recovery System, etc.” Patent No. US 8,206,124 B1. MV was issued a second patent in 2014 titled “Fugitive Gas Capture”, US Patent No. 8,708,663 B1, that expanded claims in the earlier patent. In 2017, MV was issued a third patent titled “Dry Chemical Scrubber with Ph Adjustment” Patent No. US 9,630,144 B2. The patents will expire in 2029 and 2031, unless otherwise extended. MV is in the process of expanding the scope and number of claims of this issued patent.
 
In 2013, PWS filed provisional and non-provisional patent applications in the name and for the benefit of SEER arising out of and related to its waste disposal technology involving a pyrolitic first phase and a “cold plasma” second phase system referred to as “plasma light,” or CoronaLux™ technology. In October 2014 SEER was issued patent No. 8,870,735 for this CoronaLux™ technology. In 2014, PWS filed a provisional patent related to destruction of volatile organic compounds. A pyrolytic process is basically the decomposition of any material at elevated temperatures in a very low oxygen-containing atmosphere, as compared to conventional incineration or pyrolysis processes. In July 2016 SEER was issued patent No. 9,393,519 for this CoronaLux™ technology. In January 2017 SEER was issued patent No. 9,550,148 for heavy metal control adding to the pollution control aspect of the CoronaLux™ technology. The patents will expire in or around 2033.
 
Competition
 
The industrial services industry is highly competitive. We compete with several small and medium-sized companies in the gas treatment sector. In the face of this competition, we have been effective in maintaining, and in some sectors, growing our revenue opportunities due to the wide range of services we offer, a competitive pricing structure, our innovative and proprietary/patent-pending technologies, and a reputation for reliability, built over the nearly 20 years of business operations as well as the care we take in performing and completing each customer project.
 
The medical waste industry is also highly competitive with fewer, but larger businesses in the space and one entity having a dominant position in the industry.
 
In all its businesses, the Company currently holds very small parts of very large and growing markets. MV competes by providing superior hydrogen sulfide (“H2S”) “scrubbing” solutions that result in more cost-effective removal of H2S from process gas streams. H2S is highly corrosive and is a precursor to sulfur dioxide, a highly regulated air pollutant. Therefore, removing H2S from industrial process waste streams is essential to enhance personnel safety, extend the life of industrial equipment, and minimize resulting air pollution. In the markets served by MV there are a number of competing technologies employed such as: biological scrubbing, chemical scrubbing, and dry scrubbing with activated carbon. PWS competes by offering a unique on-site, on-demand waste destruction solution, eliminating the need for waste segregation, transportation, incineration, autoclaving and/or landfilling; in turn, eliminating all of the associated costs and legacy liabilities associated with current options for medical waste handling. We believe that the patented CoronaLux™ technology results in a superior option in the medical waste management sector and in ultimate emissions cleaner than other solutions available in the market.

Environmental Matters and Regulation
 
Significant federal environmental laws affecting us are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund Act”, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”).
 
RCRA. RCRA is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal. Pursuant to RCRA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has established a comprehensive “cradle-to-grave” system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous or solid waste. States that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the EPA have been delegated authority by the EPA to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the EPA’s program. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit from the EPA or an authorized state agency, unless a specific exemption exists, and must comply with certain operating requirements.
 
The Superfund Act. The Superfund Act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. It also provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA of the release of hazardous substances into the environment. It authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup. The statute provides for strict, and in certain cases, joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs, and for liability for the cost of damages to natural resources, to the parties involved in the generation, transportation and disposal of such hazardous substances. Under the statute, we may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance that is released into the environment, or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment.
 
The Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act was passed by Congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for specific sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride, or criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for non-attainment areas to meet certain ambient air quality standards. These amendments also require the EPA to promulgate regulations, which (i) control emissions of 189 hazardous air pollutants; (ii) create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities similar to RCRA operating permits; (iii) mandate the phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals; and (iv) provide for enhanced enforcement.
 
Clean Water Act. This legislation prohibits discharges into the waters of the United States without government authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and treatment facilities.
 
Other Federal Laws. In addition to regulations specifically directed at the transportation, storage, and disposal facilities, there are a number of regulations that may “pass-through” to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities. Each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste, facility or industry. In our transportation operations, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass. Health and safety standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or “OSHA”, are applicable to all of our operations.
 
Pursuant to the EPA’s authorization of their RCRA equivalent programs, a number of states have regulatory programs governing the permitting and operation of hazardous waste facilities. Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water and clean air. Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land-use restrictions. Although our facilities occasionally have been cited for regulatory violations, we believe we are in substantial compliance with all federal, state and local laws regulating our business.

Insurance
 
To cover potential risks associated with the variety of services that the operating companies provide, we maintain adequate insurance coverages, including: 1) Casualty Insurance providing coverage for Commercial General Liability, Automotive Liability, Professional Liability Insurance and Employee Benefits Liability in the amounts of $1 million each, respectively, per year; 2) Contractor’s Pollution Liability Insurance, which has limits of $1 million per occurrence and $1 million in the aggregate; and 3) An Excess Umbrella Liability Policy of $5 million per occurrence and $5 million aggregate limit overall.
Health, Safety and Compliance
 
Preserving the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate, as well as remaining in compliance with local, state and federal rules and regulations are the highest priorities for us and our companies. We strive to maintain the highest professional standards in our compliance and health and safety activities. To achieve this objective, we engage with a professional safety firm and emphasize comprehensive training programs for new employees as well as ongoing mandatory refresher programs, and safety bonus programs for existing employees. These programs are administered at both the corporate and field levels on a daily basis. Our efforts to ensure the health and safety of employees have been formally recognized by our customers as well as by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

Research and Development
 
Research and Development (“R&D”) costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses. R&D expenses consist primarily of salaries, project materials, contract labor and other costs associated with ongoing product development and enhancement efforts. We spent approximately $0 on R&D for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020. As the Company brings its organic fertilizer products, Pellechar10™ and Pellechar30™, to market, it plans to allocate a small R&D budget in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, anticipated to be less than $100,000.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 14 non-union hourly and salaried employees, 1 of which was part-time. Our business has some seasonality that requires us to use day laborers.
