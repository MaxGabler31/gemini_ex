Item 1. Business
Who we are
Match Group, Inc. is a leading provider of dating products available in over 40 languages to our users all over the world through applications and websites we own and operate. We operate a portfolio of brands, including Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, OkCupid, OurTime, Pairs and Hinge, as well as a number of other brands, each designed to increase our users’ likelihood of finding a meaningful connection. Through our portfolio of trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users.
As used herein, “Match Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to Match Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Consumers’ dating preferences vary significantly, influenced in part by demographics, geography, religion and sensibility. As a result, the market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the dating category as a whole.
Given these wide-ranging consumer preferences, our strategy focuses on a brand portfolio approach, through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We believe that this approach maximizes our ability to capture additional users. We work to apply a centralized discipline to learnings, by sharing best practices and technologies across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs and maximize profitability. Additionally, we centralize certain other administrative functions, such as legal, human resources, finance, tax, and others. This approach allows us to quickly introduce new products and features, optimize marketing strategies, and more effectively deploy talent across our organization.
Enabling dating in a digital world
Prior to the proliferation of mobile devices and computers, human connections traditionally were limited by social circles, geography and time. Today, the adoption of mobile technology and the internet has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships, create new interactions and develop romantic connections. Additionally, the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas that previously prevented individuals from using technology to help find and develop those connections.
We believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users, including:

• | Expanded options: Dating products provide users access to a large number of like-minded people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet.


• | Efficiency: The search and matching features, as well as the profile information available on dating products, allow users to filter a large number of options in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone.


• | More comfort and control: Compared to the traditional ways that people meet, dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around the process of reaching out to new people. This leads to many people who would otherwise be passive participants in the dating process taking a more active role.


• | Convenience: The nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time, regardless of where they are.

Depending on a person’s circumstances at any given time, dating products can act as a supplement to, or substitute for, traditional means of meeting people. When selecting a dating product, we believe that users consider the following attributes:

• | Brand recognition: Brand is very important. Users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and a higher level of security. Generally, successful dating brands depend on large,

active communities of users, strong algorithmic filtering technology and awareness of successful usage among similar users.

• | Successful experiences: Demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through word-of-mouth recommendations. Successful experiences also drive repeat usage.


• | Community identification: Users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can associate. By selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic, religion, geography or intent (for example, casual dating or more serious relationships), users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify.


• | Product features and user experience: Users tend to gravitate towards dating products that offer features and user experiences that resonate with them, such as question-based matching algorithms, location-based features, offline events or search capabilities. User experience is also driven by the type of user interface (for example, swiping versus scrolling), a particular mix of free and paid features, ease of use, privacy and security. Users expect every interaction with a dating product to be seamless and intuitive.

Our portfolio
Dating is a highly personal endeavor and consumers have a wide variety of preferences that determine what type of dating product they choose. As a result, our strategy focuses on a portfolio approach of various brands in order to reach a broad range of users. Our brands are collectively available in over 40 languages all over the world. The following is a list of our key brands: 
Tinder. Tinder was launched in 2012 and has since risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the online dating category with limited marketing spend, growing to over 4.3 million Subscribers today. Tinder’s distinctive “right swipe” feature has led to significant adoption among the millennial generation, previously underserved by the online dating category. Tinder employs a freemium model, through which users are allowed to enjoy many of the core features of Tinder for free, including limited use of the “swipe right” feature with unlimited communication with other users. However, to enjoy premium features, such as unlimited use of the “swipe right” feature, a Tinder user must subscribe to either Tinder Plus, launched in early 2015, or Tinder Gold, which was launched in late summer 2017. Tinder users and Subscribers may also pay for certain premium features, such as Super Likes and Boosts, on a pay-per-use basis.
Match. Match was launched in 1995 and helped create the online dating category. Among its distinguishing features are the ability to search profiles, receive algorithmic matches and attend live events, promoted by Match, with other Subscribers. Additionally, new features, such as Missed Connections, which uses location-based technology to enable users to connect with other users with whom they have crossed paths in the past, engage users into more meaningful connections. Match is a brand that focuses on users with a higher level of intent to enter into a relationship and its product and marketing are designed to reinforce that approach. Match relies heavily on word-of-mouth traffic, repeat usage and paid marketing.
PlentyOfFish. PlentyOfFish was launched in 2003 and acquired in October 2015. Similar to Match, among its distinguishing features is the ability to both search profiles and receive algorithmic matches. Similar to Tinder, PlentyOfFish has grown to popularity over the years with very limited marketing spend and also relies on a freemium model. PlentyOfFish has broad appeal in the central United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and a number of other international markets.
Meetic. Meetic, a leading European online dating brand based in France, was launched in 2001. Similar to Match, among its distinguishing features are the ability to search profiles, receive algorithmic matches, and attend live events, promoted by Meetic, with other Subscribers and non-Subscribers from time to time. Also, similar to Match, Meetic is a brand that focuses on users with a higher level of intent to enter into a relationship and its product and marketing are designed to reinforce that approach. Meetic relies heavily on word-of-mouth traffic, repeat usage and paid marketing.
OkCupid. OkCupid was launched in 2004 and has attracted users through a mathematical and Q&A approach to the online dating category. Similar to Tinder and PlentyOfFish, OkCupid has grown in popularity over the years without significant marketing spend and also relies on a freemium model. OkCupid has a loyal highly educated user base predominately located in major cities in the United States and United Kingdom.

OurTime. OurTime is the largest brand within our affinity-oriented brands. OurTime is the largest community of singles over age 50 of any dating product.
Pairs. Pairs was launched in 2012 and acquired in May 2015. Pairs is a leading provider of dating products in Japan, with a strong presence in Taiwan and a growing presence in other select Asian countries. Pairs is a dating app that was specifically designed to address social barriers generally associated with the use of dating products in Asian countries, particularly Japan. 
Hinge. Hinge was launched in 2012 and following a series of investments, Match took a controlling stake in Hinge in June 2018 and purchased all of the remaining outstanding equity in December 2018. Hinge is a mobile-only experience and employs a freemium model. Hinge focuses on users with a higher level of intent to enter into a relationship and its product is designed to reinforce that approach.
All our products enable users to establish a profile and review other users’ profiles without charge. Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free, and some of which require payment depending on the particular product. In general, access to premium features requires a subscription, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance. Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of a subscription purchased, the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access, and whether or not a Subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers. In addition to subscriptions, many of our products offer the user certain features, such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time, or to review certain profiles without any signaling to the other users, and these features are offered on a pay-per-use, or à la carte, basis. The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand-by-brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
The brands in our portfolio both compete and collaborate with each other. We attempt to empower individual business leaders with the authority and incentives to grow each of our brands. Our brands compete with each other and with third-party dating businesses on brand characteristics, product features, and business model. We also attempt to centrally facilitate excellence and efficiency across the entire portfolio by:

• | centralizing operational functions across certain brands where we have strength in personnel and sufficient commonality of business interest (for example, ad sales, online marketing and technology centralized across some, but not all, brands);


• | developing talent across the portfolio to allow for expertise development and career advancement while giving us the ability to deploy the best talent in the most critical positions across the company at any given time;


• | sharing analytics and similar data to leverage product and marketing successes across our businesses rapidly for competitive advantage; and


• | centralizing certain administrative functions, like legal, trust and safety, privacy, human resources, and finance, across the entire portfolio to enable each brand to focus more on growth.

Revenue
Our revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscriptions, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and the balance from à la carte features, where users pay a non-recurring fee for a specific action or event. Each of our brands offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its unique community. In addition to direct revenue from our users, we generate indirect revenue from online advertising, which makes up a much smaller percentage of our overall revenue as compared to direct revenue.
Sales and marketing 
Certain of our brands attract the majority of their users through word-of-mouth and other free channels. Other brands rely on paid user acquisition for a significant percentage of their users. Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising, banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, email campaigns, video advertising, business development or partnership deals, and hiring influencers to promote our products. Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events.

Technology
Consistent with our general operating philosophy, each of our brands tends to develop its own technology systems to support its product, leveraging both open-source and vendor supported software technology. Each of our various brands has dedicated engineering teams responsible for software development and creation of new features to support our products across the full range of devices, from native mobile applications to desktop and mobile-web. Our engineering teams use an agile development process, allowing us to deploy frequent iterative releases for product features.
We host the majority of our brands in leased data centers located within the general geography served by the brand. Other brands, such as Tinder, utilize hosted web services, primarily Amazon Web Services, to support their infrastructure.
Competition
The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally. We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products. 
In addition to other online dating brands, we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services, such as in-person matchmakers. Arguably, our biggest competition comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other, and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | our ability to continue to increase consumer acceptance and adoption of online dating products, particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world where the stigma is only beginning to erode;


• | continued growth in internet access and smart phone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets;


• | the continued strength of our brands;


• | the breadth and depth of our active communities of users relative to those of our competitors;


• | our ability to evolve our products in response to our competitors’ offerings, user requirements, social trends, the ever-evolving technological landscape, and the ever-changing regulatory landscape, in particular, as it relates to the regulation of online platforms;


• | our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our products;


• | our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies; and


• | the design and functionality of our products.

A large portion of online dating customers use multiple dating products over a given period of time, either concurrently or sequentially, making our broad portfolio of brands a competitive advantage.
Intellectual property 
We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property, as critical to our success.
For example, we rely heavily upon the use of trademarks (primarily Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, Meetic, OurTime, Pairs, and Hinge, and associated domain names, taglines and logos) to market our dating products and applications and build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program, pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos and renew existing trademark and service mark registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine it to be necessary or otherwise appropriate and cost-effective. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark monitoring policy pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as potential unauthorized use of our material trademarks and service marks. Our enforcement of this policy affords us valuable protection under current laws, rules and regulations. We also reserve and file registrations (to the extent available) and renew existing registrations for domain names that we believe are material to our business.

We also rely upon a combination of in-licensed third-party and proprietary trade secrets, including proprietary algorithms, and upon patented and patent-pending technologies, processes and features relating to our matching process systems or related features, products and services with expiration dates from 2023 to 2036. We have an ongoing invention recognition program pursuant to which we apply for patents to the extent we determine it to be core to our product or businesses or otherwise appropriate and cost-effective.
We rely on a combination of internal and external controls, including applicable laws, rules and regulations and contractual restrictions with employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others, to establish, protect and otherwise control access to our various intellectual property rights.
Government regulation 
We are subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet generally, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. As a result, we could be subject to actions based on negligence, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions. See “Risk factors—Risks relating to our business—Inappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands’ reputations, which in turn could adversely affect our business” and “—Risks relating to our business—We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.”
Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches, primarily in the case of our operations in the United States and European Union and our handling of personal data of users located in the United States and European Union, respectively. As a result, we could be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions. See “Risk factors—Risks relating to our business—Unauthorized access of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.”
As the provider of dating products with a subscription-based element, we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain U.S. states and other countries that apply to our automatically-renewing subscription payment models. Finally, certain U.S. states and certain countries in Asia have laws that specifically govern dating services.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,400 full-time employees and approximately 100 part-time employees worldwide.

Relationship with IAC
Equity ownership and vote. Match Group has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and shares of Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis. As of February 1, 2019, IAC owned 209,919,402 shares of Class B common stock representing 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock and 15,813,277 shares of common stock. These holdings collectively represent approximately 81.1% of our outstanding shares of capital stock and approximately 97.6% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.
Intercompany agreements. In connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in November 2015, we entered into certain agreements relating to our relationship with IAC after the offering. These agreements include, among others, the six agreements described below.
Master transaction agreement. The master transaction agreement sets forth the agreements between us and IAC regarding the principal transactions necessary to separate our business from IAC, as well as governs certain aspects of our relationship with IAC.
