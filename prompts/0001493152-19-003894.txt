Company History and Recent Developments
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013, and initially sought to create reality television programming. References in this Report to “ICGL”, “Image Chain”, the “Company”, the “Registrant”, “we”, “our” or “us” are to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
 
On May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “FDHG Exchange Agreement”) with Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”) and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who were to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the FDHG Exchange Agreement (the “FDGH Shareholders”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the FDHG Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance to the stockholders of FDHG of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (“Common Stock”) and 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (“Preferred Stock”).
 
As a result of the closing of the FDHG Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG, through its subsidiaries, manufactured and sold “Image Tea”-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.
 
On June 11, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000. The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, The increase in authorized Common Stock was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital.
 
On or about November 15, 2016, FDHG disposed of its ownership of all operating assets, and as a result ICGL became a shell company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the “Disposition Event”). The Disposition Event is evidenced by a bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document.
 
On February 13, 2017, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”) to correct a mistake made in the Company’s original Articles of Incorporation with regard to the Preferred Stock issued in connection with the FDHG Exchange Agreement. As a result, ICGL had 395,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The Company subsequently entered into an agreement pursuant to which the holder of the Preferred Stock agreed to retire the Preferred Stock in exchange for receiving an equal number of shares of Common Stock of the Company. As of the date of this Report, that exchange of Preferred Stock for Common Stock has not yet occurred.
 
On May 1, 2017, upon recommendation of the Board of Directors, a majority of Image Chain’s common stockholders consented in writing to amendment of Image Chain’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) effect a reverse stock split on a 1 for 100 stock split basis from 400,000,000 authorized shares with a par value of $0.001 per share to 4,000,000 authorized shares with a par value of $0.001, and (ii) after the reverse stock split, to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 3,950,000 to 2,000,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per share, and to decrease the authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 50,000 to zero (0). As of the date of this Report, the reverse stock split and increase in authorized shares have been completed, and the decrease in shares of Preferred Stock is still in process, as a result 50,000 shares of Preferred Stock are authorized and outstanding.

The Share Exchange
 
On November 14, 2017, Image Chain entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Image P2P and the shareholders of Image P2P (the “Sellers”).

As a result of the Share Exchange, Image P2P became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. Image P2P, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in producing, marketing and selling tea polyphenol products, and is developing for production tea polyphenol-based products. Image P2P is located in the PRC.
 
The Share Exchange has been accounted for as a reverse- merger and recapitalization of Image Chain where Image Chain (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and Image P2P (the acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction, the Company is deemed to be a continuation of the business of Image P2P.

Company Overview
 
On November 28, 2018, the Company disposed of Asia Grand Will Limited and its subsidiaries and hence has terminated its business of tea polyphenol products production and sales.
 
Currently, since the Sino-US trade war may affected the enterprises operating in China in 2018, the Company has gradually shifted its market target to Malaysia. It is seeking to develop business in healthy Halal food.
 
While we expect to focus on our efforts in the Halal Food License area, we will continue to seek new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business in order to best protect our shareholder interests. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements in the Halal Food License business, or for any other potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.
 
Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
