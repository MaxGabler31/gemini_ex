Item 1.    Business
Limbach Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was formed on July 20, 2016 as a result of a business combination with Limbach Holdings LLC (“LHLLC”). The Company is an integrated building systems solutions firm whose expertise is in the design, modular prefabrication, installation, management and maintenance of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (“HVAC”), mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls systems. The Company provides comprehensive facility services consisting of mechanical construction, full HVAC service and maintenance, energy audits and retrofits, engineering and design build services, constructability evaluation, equipment and materials selection, offsite/prefabrication construction, and the complete range of sustainable building solutions. The Company operates primarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, and Southwestern regions of the United States.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries included Limbach Company LLC, which operates in New England, Eastern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and the Mid-Atlantic region; Limbach Company LP, which operates in the Southern California region; Harper Limbach, a Florida-based subsidiary and Jake Marshall, LLC and Coating Solutions, LLC, both of which are Tennessee-based subsidiaries. Each of our operations provide design, construction and maintenance services in some or all of the HVAC, plumbing and electrical fields.
The Jake Marshall Transaction. On December 2, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), the Company, and Limbach Facility Services LLC (“LFS”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Jake Marshall, LLC (“JMLLC”), Coating Solutions, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company (“CSLLC” and together with JMLLC, the “Acquired Companies” and each an “Acquired Company”) and the owners of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which LFS purchased all of the outstanding membership interests in the Acquired Companies from the Sellers (the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement collectively being the “Jake Marshall Transaction”). The Jake Marshall Transaction closed on the Effective Date. As a result of the Jake Marshall Transaction, each of the Acquired Companies became wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company.
The consideration paid by the Company for the Jake Marshall Transaction was $21.3 million (the “Closing Purchase Price”), consisting of cash paid to the Sellers, net of adjustments for working capital. The Sellers were permitted to retain the cash in the Acquired Companies at closing subject to certain adjustments for working capital, which was ultimately reflected in the total purchase price set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, the Sellers may receive up to an aggregate of $6.0 million in cash, consisting of two tranches of $3.0 million, as more fully set forth in the Purchase Agreement, if the gross profit of the Acquired Companies equals or exceeds $10.0 million in (i) the approximately 13 month period from closing through December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Earnout Period”) or (ii) Fiscal Year 2023 (the “2023 Earnout Period”), respectively (collectively, the “Earnout Payments”). To the extent, however, that the gross profit of the Acquired Companies is less than $10.0 million, but exceeds $8.0 million, during either the 2022 Earnout Period or 2023 Earnout Period, the $3.0 million amount will be prorated for such period.
See Note 3 – Acquisitions in the accompanying notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further information on the Jake Marshall Transaction.
Segments
The Company operates in two segments, which were renamed as of January 1, 2021 to reflect the Company's two distinct approaches to its customer base and to better align with its owner direct strategy. The previously named Construction segment is now known as General Contractor Relationships (“GCR”); the previously named Service segment is now known as Owner Direct Relationships (“ODR”). The Company's operating segments are based on the relationship with its customers, (i) GCR, in which the Company generally manages new construction or renovation projects that involve primarily HVAC, plumbing, or electrical services awarded to the Company by general contractors or construction managers, and (ii) ODR, in which the Company provides maintenance or service primarily on HVAC, plumbing or electrical systems, building controls and specialty contracting projects direct to, or assigned by, building owners or property managers. This work is primarily performed under fixed price, modified fixed price, and time and material contracts over periods of typically less than two years. 
GCR Segment
The Company’s GCR revenue decreased by 20.6% to $350.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $441.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in GCR revenue was primarily due to our continued focus on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing opportunities that are smaller in size, shorter in duration, and 
where we can leverage our captive design and engineering services. Gross profit improved to 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company provides its GCR segment services through a variety of project delivery methodologies.
• Competitive Lump Sum Bidding (also referred to as “Plan & Spec” Bidding). Plan & Spec bidding is a competitive bid process among multiple contractors bidding on nearly complete or completed design documents based on a lump sum price for delivery of the project. Price is the predominant selection criteria in this process.
• Design/Assist. Design/Assist is a process in which a specialty contractor is selected among competing contractors using best value methodology. In best value, a selection is made based primarily upon qualifications and project approach, and secondarily on select cost factors. Cost factors are usually limited to a fixed fee and expense estimate and an estimate of the cost of work. With Design/Assist, the specialty contractor is typically contracted early in the design process to provide design and preconstruction input as needed to assist the customer in maintaining the established budget and completing design and drawings. This delivery option often includes a guaranteed maximum price (“GMP”) on a fixed fee basis; however, sometimes the owner may offer a lump sum price to be established following the completion of design. Typically, once the specialty contractor is selected, there is no further competition. In some cases, the owner has the option of holding a competitive process at the end of design. On occasion, an owner may arrange for a cost-plus fixed fee arrangement exclusive of a GMP or lump sum arrangement.
• Design/Build. Design/Build projects may be secured on a best value or qualification-based selection basis. A Design/Build contract may be delivered as a lump sum or GMP. With Design/Build, a prime general contractor (“GC”)/construction manager (“CM”) or other contractor will directly contract with a building owner. In many cases, the prime contractor will also procure specialty contracting services on a Design/Build lump sum or GMP basis. On occasion, the Company has the opportunity to provide Re-design/Build services. With Re-design/Build, the Company typically contracts on a Design/Assist basis to participate during the design phase, as described above. If the project’s HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical design is substantially over budget, then the Company may offer to re-design the project and bring the project back into budget. Higher margins may be earned on these contracts in comparison to Design/Assist contracts and can be executed with less risk due to having designed the systems.
• Performance Contracting. In select locations within specific market sectors, the Company provides performance contracting to building owners. Performance contracting involves the assessment of a building owner’s facilities and offers a proposal to reduce energy and operating costs over a specified period of time. Energy and operating savings are delivered through replacement of energy or cost inefficient systems and equipment with more efficient systems. The Company’s performance contracting team is able to deliver the capital improvements using our Design/Build platform and then, in some instances, guarantee the energy and operating systems over an agreed upon time-frame. In most cases, the building owner provides the financing for performance contracting. In other cases, the Company arranges for third-party financing as part of the contract. Typically, performance contracts are offered on a negotiated basis. Negotiated contracts can provide for higher margins and lower risk than conventional projects. To assure the Company’s cost and operating saving guarantees, the Company requires that it provides maintenance services during the term of the agreement.
ODR Segment
The Company’s ODR revenue increased by 10.3% to $140.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross profit improved to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
The Company’s key business initiatives for its ODR segment include the establishment of long-term relationships with building owners on a direct basis as compared to contracting with a GC/CM. The Company strives to convert GCR projects into ODR business opportunities. The Company has been successful in converting GCR projects into long-term maintenance contracts with building owners; however, a large portion of the Company’s maintenance services are delivered to building owners for whom the Company has not performed construction or renovation services. Accordingly, the Company’s ODR platform can operate on a standalone basis or in conjunction with its GCR platform. The Company believes that its ODR offerings provide a distribution channel through which it can continue to deliver an expanded offering of value-added services direct to building owners that further reinforces its value proposition and differentiated capabilities. The Company’s ODR business includes multiple technical offerings, often delivered pursuant to renewable, “evergreen” contracts and provides generally for the following revenue and gross profit streams:
• Maintenance Contracts. Through “evergreen” contracts, the Company provides maintenance services for HVAC, electrical and/or plumbing systems and equipment.
• Service Project Contracts. Smaller than typical construction projects, this work is contracted directly for a building owner. On projects that are predominantly HVAC, plumbing, and/or electrical in scope, the Company may act as the “prime” GC.
• Spot Work. “Spot Work” is construction and/or service work performed on an emergency basis for building owners who are already under contract with the Company for construction and/or maintenance work.
• Automatic Temperature Controls (“ATC”). The Company provides design, installation and maintenance for specialized ATC systems through its maintenance and construction platforms to building owners and GC/CM customers.
• Special Projects Division (“SPD”). In addition to the Company’s major construction projects and its maintenance services, the Company provides construction services through its special project divisions (“SPD”). Each of the Company’s branch locations offers SPD services. SPD services are typically less than $1 million in construction cost and have short durations and limited scopes of work. These projects are primarily secured through lump sum competitive bids, though on occasion these projects may be negotiated. When design is required for an SPD project, Limbach Collaborative Services (“LCS”), formerly Limbach Engineering & Design Services, often supports the contract. Although SPD work is normally performed on projects under $1 million, the margins earned on these projects can be substantially higher than larger construction projects. Typically, the project duration for SPD services is shorter than that of large construction projects, and can sometimes be completed in less than 30 days.
• Energy Monitoring. Limbach's Energy Assessment for Performance (“LEAP”) program improves energy performance in buildings with a data-driven approach. LEAP's web-based energy management and sustainability software automatically tracks utility bills, updates key performance indicators like the Energy Star benchmarks and monitors energy use in real-time. On a routine schedule, professional engineers and certified energy managers provide expert analysis and coaching towards low and no-cost efficiency gains and discover longer-term opportunities to capture greater cost savings. 
Due to the Company’s on-going contractual relationships with certain building owners established through its maintenance services, it is well positioned with those owners when they are ready to initiate major capital construction projects. As a result, the Company’s maintenance services often lead to and help drive and support the growth of its HVAC, plumbing and electrical construction business.
For additional financial information about the Company’s operating segments, see Note 11 – Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Limbach Collaborative Services. Located in Orlando, Florida, LCS provides captive engineering capabilities, estimating and virtual design services. LCS provides professional engineering, energy analysis, estimation, and detail design and three-dimensional building installation coordination services to our various branch offices, direct to building owners, and clients in both our GCR and ODR segments. This capability allows the Company to leverage these services across its entire business. In addition, this capability distinguishes the Company from competitors that more typically provide Design/Build services by hiring external engineering companies. By providing professional engineering through LCS, the Company delivers integrated Design/Build services to the market. By bundling engineering services with construction, the Company’s clients avoid the costly expense of separate engineering services.
The core capability of LCS is professional engineering. Combined throughout the Company’s business, it maintains eight registered professional engineers on staff, who are supported by a staff of approximately 33 estimators and designers. LCS acts as the engineer of record for projects where the Company serves as a Design/Build specialty contractor. LCS engineers have experience in healthcare, institutional, commercial, hospitality, and industrial projects. The Company’s operations in all of its regions have complete access to a large staff of professional engineers and designers through LCS. LCS controls the development and maintenance of the Company’s Limbach Modeling and Production System (“LMPS”). LMPS is a comprehensive database, workflow, and reporting system used by LCS and all of the Company’s branches to design, estimate, plan, and track construction projects. The Company believes LMPS is unique in the industry and provides a competitive advantage by providing highly technical services in-house in a cost effective manner. LMPS is a Building Information Modeling (“BIM”) tool that allows the Company to construct mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering (“MEP”) systems in a virtual environment, avoid conflicts in the field, eliminate rework caused by coordination issues, maximize the use of off-site prefabrication of assemblies, and capture installation productivity and construction progress. The Company utilizes LMPS beginning with the original engineering concept and throughout the construction process to continuously monitor progress and avoid wasted efforts. Many others in the industry expend additional costs to third parties for redrawing and remodeling effort to achieve the same results.
Strategy
The Company focuses on creating value for building owners by targeting opportunities for long-term relationships. The key objectives of the Company’s strategy is to improve profitability and generate quality growth in its operations, to enable sustainable and efficient building environments, to continue investing in its workforce and to acquire strategically synergistic businesses. In order to accomplish the Company’s objectives, it is currently focused on the following areas:
ODR Growth Initiative. The Company’s principal focus over the past year, and a focus that the Company expects to continue in coming years, was the accelerated growth of its ODR segment, which includes maintenance services, small projects, building controls installation and service, building environment management and performance services, and other project opportunities performed direct for building owners. The Company is focused on expanding the number and breath of owner relationships that it serves on a direct basis and to leverage these expanded owner-direct relationships to deliver a broad suite of services. The Company has made substantial investments to expand its ODR revenue by increasing the value it can offer to service and maintenance customers. The Company is actively concentrating managerial and sales resources on training and hiring experienced employees to sell and profitably perform ODR work. In many locations the Company has added or upgraded its capabilities, and the Company believes its investments and efforts have provided customer value and stimulated growth. To further enhance the Company’s ODR services within one of its largest market sectors, healthcare, the Company is now offering a Program Management Service. Program Management Services provide the Company’s healthcare customers with advisory support and strategic guidance to help match their long-term facility needs. These services include the defining of capital program needs for new and existing facilities. In addition, these services offer assessments of existing facilities for project upgrades to improve the operations of the buildings tied to MEP systems.
The Company continues to expand its owner-direct offerings to include other digital solutions to manage and monitor the performance of building systems, including data analytics, energy consumption and sustainability. These services allow the Company to develop new revenue streams leveraging its professional services capabilities, to support multi-location regional and national customers in core end-markets, and to drive energy retrofit and performance optimization projects for building owners. 
Improved GCR Segment Margins. In the Company’s GCR segment, its efforts are focused on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing opportunities that are smaller in size, shorter in duration, and where it can leverage its captive design and engineering services.
Maintain a Diverse Customer, Geographic and Project Base. The Company has a distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that it believes reduces its exposure to negative developments in any given sector. The Company also has significant geographical diversification across regions of the United States, again reducing its exposure to negative developments in any given region. The Company’s core market sectors consist of the following:
•Healthcare, including research, acute care and inpatient hospitals for regional and national hospital groups, and pharmaceutical and biotech laboratories and manufacturing facilities;
•Education, including both public and private colleges, universities, research centers and K-12 facilities;
•Sports and entertainment, including sports arenas, entertainment facilities (including casinos) and amusement rides;
•Infrastructure, including passenger terminals and maintenance facilities for rail and airports;
•Government, including various facilities for federal, state and local agencies;
•Hospitality, including hotels and resorts;
•Commercial, including office building, warehouse and distribution centers and other commercial structures;
•Mission critical facilities, including data centers; and
•Industrial manufacturing facilities, including indoor grow farms and automotive, energy and general manufacturing plants.
The Company is particularly focused on expanding its top four sectors noted above (healthcare, education, mission critical facilities and industrial manufacturing facilities), leveraging its core areas of expertise and targeting projects with optimal risk/reward characteristics. 
Investment in its Employees. Employee development underpins the Company’s efforts to execute its strategy. The Company seeks to attract and retain quality employees by providing them an enhanced career path that offers a stable income, attractive 
benefits packages and excellent advancement opportunities. The Company invests in its employees through safety and wellness programs, internal communication, career development training programs, recognition programs and succession planning initiatives.
Fully Integrated Operations. A core growth strategy of the Company includes offering design, construction and maintenance services for the full complement of HVAC, plumbing and electrical services in all of our branch operations. The Company currently offers certain of these services in each of its regions, with electrical self-perform design, installation and maintenance services being offered primarily in its Mid-Atlantic region. In addition, the Company offers electrical services through installation subcontracting in its Ohio, Eastern Pennsylvania and Florida regions. Over the coming years, the Company plans to further equip each of its regions to provide a combined offering of mechanical construction and maintenance, and building system management services. The Company believes this combined offering is appealing to building owners who own and operate facilities with complex building systems. The Company also offers services to building owners known as MEP Prime, a service where the Company acts as the general contractor on assignments that predominantly include a heavy concentration of mechanical HVAC, electrical, plumbing and building controls systems, along with other trades such as concrete and drywall, to offer a complete service package. 
Complex systems lend themselves to delivery methodologies that fit the Company’s value proposition to its customers and integrated business model, including design/assist and design/build. The Company believes that few specialty contractors in the United States offer fully integrated HVAC, plumbing and electrical services. The Company believes its integrated approach provides a significant competitive advantage, especially when combined with our proprietary design and production software systems. The Company’s integrated approach allows for increased prefabrication of HVAC components, improved cycle times for project delivery and reduced risks associated with onsite construction.
Growth through Acquisitions. The Company believes that it can further increase its cash flow and operating income by acquiring strategically synergistic companies that will supplement the Company’s current business model, address capability gaps and enhance the breadth of its service offerings to better serve its clients. The Company has dedicated and continues to dedicate its resources to seek opportunities to acquire and integrate businesses that have attractive market positions, a record of consistent positive cash flow, and desirable geographic market locations.
In 2021, the Company was ranked the 7th largest mechanical contractor according to information provided by Engineering News Record. 
GCR and ODR Backlog
The Company refers to its estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue it had recognized under such contracts, as “backlog.” Backlog includes unexercised contract options. The Company’s backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Additionally, the difference between the Company’s backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the portion of unexercised contract options that are excluded, under certain contract types, from its remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by the Company or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Additional information related to the Company’s remaining performance obligations is provided in Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the accompanying notes to its consolidated financial statements. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.”
The Company’s GCR backlog was $337.2 million and $393.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Projects are brought into backlog once the Company has been provided a written confirmation of award and the contract value has been established. At any point in time, the Company has a substantial volume of projects that are specifically identified and advanced in negotiations and/or documentation, however those projects are not booked as backlog until the Company has received written confirmation from the owner or the GC/CM of their intention to award it the contract and they have directed the Company to begin engineering, designing, incurring construction labor costs or procuring needed equipment and material. The Company’s GCR projects tend to be built over a 12- to 24-month schedule depending upon scope and complexity. Most major projects have a preconstruction planning phase which may require months of planning before actual construction commences. The Company is occasionally employed to deliver a “fast-track” project, where construction commences as the preconstruction planning work continues. As work on the Company’s projects progress, it increases or decreases backlog to take into account its estimate of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changes in conditions, change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenue, and the percentage of completion of the Company’s work on the projects. Based on historical trends, the Company estimates that 65% of its GCR backlog as of December 31, 2021 will be recognized as revenue during 2022. Additionally, the reduction in GCR backlog has been intentional as the Company looks to focus on higher margin projects than historically, as well as its focus on smaller, higher margin owner direct projects. As of December 31, 2021, GCR 
backlog included approximately $33.8 million of backlog associated with the operations of the entities acquired in the Jake Marshall Transaction. 
The Company’s ODR backlog was $98.0 million and $50.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts reflect unrecognized revenue expected to be recognized over the remaining terms of our service contracts and projects. Based on historical trends, the Company estimates that 69% of its ODR backlog as of December 31, 2021 will be recognized as revenue during 2022. The Company believes its ODR backlog increased due to its continued focus on ODR growth. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, ODR backlog included approximately $22.6 million of backlog associated with the operations of the entities acquired in the Jake Marshall Transaction. 
Customers
The Company’s customer base primarily consists of building owners and their third-party representatives, general contractors and construction managers.
The Company’s aforementioned strategic goals include continued growth of its direct relationships with building owners. Building owners control capital and operating investments. This not only improves the Company’s position when entering into construction contracts with these owners, but also allows it to build long-term relationships around recurring maintenance services and smaller repair and installation projects. This also positions the Company to deliver additional products and services in the future, including digital offerings. In its typical customer life cycle, the Company pursues opportunities to build or renovate facilities through a GC/CM. In most cases, this relationship is the Company’s primary point of entry into the building owner’s organization. However, the Company maintains hundreds of building owner relationships through its contracts for program management, maintenance, smaller project renovations and energy retrofits. In the Company’s experience, when building owners are planning a project that involves predominantly HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical services, they often ask the GC/CM to assign the work directly to the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no direct ODR customer relationship accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue.
The Company believes it has strong relationships with many national commercial GC/CMs. As one of its core risk management processes, the Company is selective in choosing to work with GC/CMs that have similar core values, that have a solid payment history, that have experienced and available project management labor, and who value the Company’s services and reputation. Most of the Company’s branches also maintain strong relationships with local and regional GC/CMs that fit its selection criteria. For the year ended December 31, 2021, two GCR segment customers accounted for approximately 17% and 12% of consolidated total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had one GCR segment customer that accounted for approximately 14% of consolidated total revenue.
Competition
The HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and maintenance industry is highly competitive and the geographic markets in which the Company competes has numerous companies that provide similar services. Factors influencing the Company’s competitiveness include price, reputation for quality, ability to reduce customer costs, experience and expertise, financial strength, surety bonding capacity, knowledge of local markets and conditions, availability and experience of craft labor, and customer relationships. Competitors tend to be regional firms that vary in size and depth of resources. There are, however, significant national competitors that have greater national presence and breadth of expertise than the Company does.
Materials & Equipment
The Company purchases materials, including sheet metal, steel and copper piping, electrical conduit, wire and other various materials from numerous sources. The Company also purchases equipment from various manufacturers. The price and availability of materials and equipment may vary from year to year due to market conditions and industry production capacities. Global supply chain issues, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (defined below), have resulted in increased material and equipment costs, as well as higher competition for resources and labor constraints within distribution networks, which has also caused increased costs and scheduling delays, pushing revenue into future periods. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company was impacted by supply chain issues delaying equipment delivery, which resulted in revenue being pushed to future periods. The Company continues to monitor the short- and long-term impacts resulting from the global supply chain issues and is taking steps to mitigate against additional impacts. 
Human Capital
To ensure that the Company is well positioned to provide innovative system solutions and reliable services in a safe, efficient and responsible manner, the Company seeks to employ a team of highly dedicated and accomplished people who genuinely care about the success of the Company. Creating an engaging workplace environment that provides for competitive pay and 
benefits, attractive career development opportunities, and a collaborative, respectful culture further enables the Company to achieve continued success.
Employees. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 1,650 employees, including approximately 450 full-time salaried employees, comprised of project managers, estimators, superintendents and engineers who manage crews in its construction business and office staff. The Company also had approximately 1,200 craft employees, some of whom are represented by various labor unions. The Company believes it has a good relationship with its employees. In most locations, the Company has developed strong partnerships with local unions to have access to an experienced, talented craft workforce. 
Core Values and Core Purpose. From the technician in the field to the leadership of its business, the Company focuses on caring for people. The Company’s core purpose “is to create great opportunities for people.” The Company has implemented internal development programs, which allow it to attract and retain talent and emphasize the importance of promoting from within. The Company believes its core values reflect who it is. The Company cares about its people and believes its approach provides a competitive advantage. The Company believes it has strong employee retention rates as a result of its ability to hire, develop and retain top industry talent.
The Company’s culture is driven by its Core Values:
•We CARE
•We Strive for EXCELLENCE
•We Act with INTEGRITY
•We Are ACCOUNTABLE
The Company believes each employee is essential to its continued success and the Company seeks to provide every employee with the foundation and environment needed to achieve the employee’s goals. This objective begins with the Company's commitment to diversity and inclusion. We CARE, one of the Company’s Core Values, is the foundation of its efforts to create a diverse and inclusive organization. Building a culture where all of its employees feel a sense of belonging is important to the Company. The Company’s diversity efforts began as a focus on Women in Construction and Service (“WICS”), which highlighted the opportunity to attract and grow the number of women in the industry. WICS was the Company’s first employee resource group, which was created to make sure its employees feel empowered, included and heard. The Company expanded its diversity and inclusion efforts by creating its Embrace Forum. The vision of this initiative is to create a diverse and inclusive environment where employees feel safe, respected and valued. The Embrace Forum has a broad reach and consists of leaders across the organization who seek to influence an evolving workforce and enhance recruitment, development and engagement strategies.
In addition, the Company screens leadership hires and measures employee performance against these Core Values, and regularly measures employee engagement against these values through the Company’s annual employee engagement survey. The Company’s “We Care” survey, which has been issued for the past 15+ years, provides leadership with insights, including constructive ideas on how to improve the overall business for those who work for it.
Benefits & Wellness. The Company focuses on the most crucial component for its success: its people. The Company appreciates the fact that it owes its century-old existence to employees who work hard to help the Company prosper.
As such, the Company has committed itself to the health, safety and well-being of its workers and their families. One of the ways the Company shows its commitment is through offering competitive employee compensation and benefits packages, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of each individual in its organization, which include:
•Health and Welfare Plans. All full-time employees who do not participate in union plans are offered a range of choices among medical, dental and vision plans, life, accident, dependent and disability insurance, and pre-tax health spending accounts that include employer contributions.
•Retirement Savings. The Company helps provide its employees with financial security by offering a 401(k) Savings Plan, which includes company matching contributions, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
•Employee Assistance Programs. Through the Company’s Employee Assistance Program, it offers its employees, and their dependents or household members, access to services and counseling on a variety of personal, professional, legal, and financial matters, at no cost.
•Wellness Program. Consists of various activities and financial incentives intended to inspire the Company’s team towards healthy living through personal accountability. 
Safety Culture. Safety is integral to the Company’s unique culture and Core Values. The Company cares about its employees and their families, and it holds each other accountable for working safely. The Company’s safety culture is based on its “Hearts and Minds Commitment to Safety” Program, established in 2013 by senior staff and field professionals via its Hearts and Minds Forum. The Company’s Hearts & Minds program asks its employees to take direct responsibility for eliminating and preventing all incidents and injuries at home and in the workplace, which is done by:
•Hiring the Right People. The Company is focused on hiring qualified employees who share in its Core Values.
•Knowing the Details. Performed through thorough planning and having acute awareness of present surroundings, which aids in executing work safely. 
•Engaging at All Levels. Setting a great example of completing all tasks safely, at work and at home, by everyone from company leadership to craft professional.
•Mentoring and Coaching. Acting as a mentor and coach to show team members how to practice good safety behavior.
This program helped earn the Company’s Ohio location, the highest honor for which Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) can name a company; OSHA-Voluntary Protection Programs Star Site. This was the first time a union mechanical contractor has earned such an honor in the United States. The Company strives to achieve this honor at its other locations. 
In the February 2020 issue of Safety+Health Magazine, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Charles A. Bacon, III, was recognized by the National Safety Council as one of nine CEOs who “Get It.” Peers, building owners, and safety professionals recognize the Company as a leader and innovator in safety culture and process. The Company has received a myriad of awards and recognition for its safety programs and processes regionally and nationally. “We Care” goes beyond a statement, it is the core of the Company’s culture. 
Seasonality
Severe weather can impact the Company’s operations. In the northern climates where it operates, and to a lesser extent the southern climates as well, severe winters can slow the Company’s productivity on construction projects, which shifts revenue and gross profit recognition to a later period. The Company’s maintenance operations may also be impacted by mild or severe weather. Mild weather tends to reduce demand for the Company’s maintenance services, whereas severe weather may increase the demand for its maintenance and spot services.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption and volatility on a global scale resulting in, among other things, an economic slowdown, impacts to global supply chains, and the possibility of a continued economic recession. In limited instances, during fiscal 2020, the Company faced disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic as certain projects chose to shutdown work irrespective of the existence or applicability of government action. In most markets, construction is considered an essential business and the Company continued to staff its projects and perform work during fiscal 2020 and into 2021, and most of the projects that were in progress at the time shutdowns commenced were restarted. 
As new variants of the virus emerge, the Company remains cautious as many factors remain unpredictable. The Company actively monitors and responds to the changing conditions created by the pandemic, with focus on prioritizing the health and safety of the Company’s employees, dedicating resources to support the Company’s communities, and innovating to address the Company’s customers’ needs. During 2021, the Company faced impacts of both the Delta and Omicron variants, with disruptions to the Company’s workforce, which impacted revenue.
Supply chain disruptions, material shortages and escalating commodity prices as a result of COVID-19 are expected to continue into 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company was impacted by supply chain issues delaying equipment delivery, which resulted in revenue being pushed to future periods. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s vendors and the pricing and availability of materials or supplies utilized in the Company’s operations continues to evolve and may have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations in future periods. The Company continues to monitor the short- and long-term impacts of the pandemic, including the current supply chain disruptions.
As vaccines have become more readily available, the Company has experienced a growing number of the Company’s clients requiring that the Company’s workforce present on the client's property be vaccinated against the virus. Additionally, requirements to mandate COVID-19 vaccination of the Company’s workforce or requirements of the Company’s unvaccinated employees to be tested could result in labor disruptions, employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs. See ““Item 1A. Risk Factors — COVID-19 vaccination mandates applicable to us and certain of our employees may result in our inability to pursue certain work, an increase in attrition rates or absenteeism within our labor force, challenges securing future labor needs, inefficiencies connected to employee turnover, and costs associated with implementation and on-going compliance, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects on the Company’s workforce of the U.S. Government vaccine mandate for employees, contractors, and subcontractors that service federal contracts and the OSHA requirement on the Company’s workforce. 
The Company continues to monitor developments involving the Company’s workforce, customers, suppliers and vendors and take steps to mitigate against additional impacts, but given the unprecedented and evolving nature of these circumstances, the Company cannot predict the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
Government and Environmental Regulations
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. The Company also is subject to compliance with numerous other laws and regulations of federal, state, local agencies, and authorities, including those relating to workplace safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues (including the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws), immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of its business. In addition, a relatively limited number of the Company’s construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses. A large portion of the Company’s business uses labor that is provided under collective bargaining agreements. As such, the Company is subject to federal laws and regulations related to unionized labor and collective bargaining (including the National Labor Relations Act).
The Company continually monitors its compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements. While compliance with existing laws, regulations and other requirements has not materially adversely affected the Company’s operations in the past, and it is not aware of any proposed requirements that the Company anticipates will have a material impact on its operations, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change or that compliance will not otherwise adversely affect the Company’s operations in the future. In addition, while the Company typically passes any costs of compliance on to its customers under the applicable project agreement, either directly or as part of its estimate depending on the type of contract, there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur compliance expenses in the future that materially adversely affect its results of operations. Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and other laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon persons that contribute to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.
Climate Change and Sustainability
The Company recognizes its environmental and societal responsibilities and is committed to sustainability and to improving its environmental footprint as well as operating its business in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of the Company’s employees and customers, as well as the public. The Company’s focus on environmental stewardship and improving productivity drives not only its efforts to become more energy efficient but also improvements in the Company’s customers' impact on climate change. Replacing an aging building’s existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building’s energy consumption and carbon footprint while improving cost, air quality, and overall system effectiveness.
The Company is subject to the requirements of numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and rules that promote the protection of the environment. While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not currently anticipate that they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures or competitive position in the short term.
