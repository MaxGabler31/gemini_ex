Subsidiaries
 We operate through our subsidiaries, including:
 Clinigence Health, Inc. (CHI)
 Based in Fort Lauderdale, FL, CHI is a healthcare information technology company providing a cloud-based platform that enables healthcare organizations to provide value-based care and population health management (PHM). Our proprietary cloud-based PHM platform extracts claims and clinical data from multiple claims and EHR systems, which it then uses to report clinical quality measures (GPRO, MIPS, etc.), gaps in care, risk-stratification of patients, generates a utilization dashboard on every provider, has predictive analytics and a provider scorecard. The CHI platform provides SaaS solutions that enable connected intelligence across the care continuum by transforming massive amounts of data into actionable insights. CHI’s solutions help healthcare organizations improve the quality and cost effectiveness of care, enhance population health management and optimize provider networks.
AHP Health Management Services, Inc. (AHP)
 Based in Los Angeles, California, AHP’s affiliated IPA, AHISP currently provides care for 22,065 patients, including approximately 1800 Medicare Advantage patients, through a network of 141 primary care physicians and 660 specialists. An IPA is an association of independent physicians, or other organization that contracts with independent physicians, and provides services to HMOs, which are medical insurance groups that provide health services generally for a fixed annual fee, on a negotiated per capita rate, flat retainer fee, or negotiated FFS basis.

Procare Health Inc. (Procare)
 Based in Garden Grove, California, Procare is a management services organization (“MSO”) that currently provides services for one health maintenance organization (“HMO”) and three IPAs in Southern and Northern California. MSOs are business organizations that provide the necessary administrative infrastructure and technology for risk-bearing IPAs to function successfully in their relationships with contracted payors and regulatory agencies. MSOs enable physician organizations to succeed in the assumption of financial and population risk, to improve the organization’s performance in care delivery and to provide actionable data analytics. Procare provides claims administration, compliance, credentialing, quality management, utilization management, contracting, provider relations, member services, care management, coding optimization and financial reporting services, among other services.
Investments
 Accountable Healthcare America, Inc. (AHA)
 Based in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, AHA is a medical management platform company that had an investment in an accountable care organization with approximately (Accountable Care Medical Group of Florida, Inc.” or “ACMG”) 16,000 Medicare members through a network of over 65 providers. Through its investment, AHA provides a suite of services for its providers, including care coordination, high-risk care managers, documentation improvement and medical coding programs, medical management best practices programs, health management programs such as annual wellness visits and chronic care management, and performance improvement plans.
 On November 12, 2021, ACMG was sold to Genuine Health Group, LLC for a purchase price of $30 million less costs and adjustments. AHA’s share of the proceeds was $5,887,806. Cash of $4,554,676 was received at Closing, and a receivable of $1,333,130 was recorded. The Stock Purchase Agreement also contains additional earn out consideration payments upon which AHA is expected to receive its pro-rata portion, however, we cannot assign a definitive value to the contingent consideration at this time
 Our Revenue Streams
 Our revenue reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes revenue generated by our subsidiaries and consolidated entities. Revenue generated by consolidated entities, however, does not necessarily result in available or distributable cash for the Company. Our revenue streams flow from various multi-year renewable contractual arrangements that vary by type of business operation as follows:
Capitation Revenue
 Our capitation revenue comes from our AHP subsidiary and consists primarily of capitated fees for medical services its VIE AHISP provides under capitated arrangements made directly with various managed care providers including HMOs. Capitation revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of enrollees selecting us as their healthcare provider. Capitation is a fixed payment amount per patient per unit of time paid in advance for the delivery of health care services, whereby the service providers are generally liable for excess medical costs. The actual amount paid is determined by the ranges of services provided, the number of patients enrolled, and the period of time during which the services are provided. Capitation rates are generally based on local costs and average utilization of services. Because Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates managed care providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual enrollee, managed care providers with higher acuity enrollees receive more, and those with lower acuity enrollees receive less, capitation that can be allocated to service providers. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled.

Per member per month (“PMPM”) managed care contracts generally have a term of one year or longer. All managed care contracts have a single performance obligation that constitutes a series for the provision of managed healthcare services for a population of enrolled members for the duration of the contract. The transaction price for PMPM contracts is variable as it primarily includes PMPM fees associated with unspecified membership that fluctuates throughout the term of the contract. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives, performance guarantees and risk shares.
 SaaS Subscriptions Revenue 
 Our SaaS revenue comes from our CHI subsidiary. SaaS-based subscriptions are generally marketed under multi-year agreements with annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or month-to-month renewals and revenue is recognized ratably over the renewal period with the unearned amounts received recorded as deferred revenue.
Management Fee Income
 Procare’s revenue is generated primarily through management fees that are received based on Gross Capitation Revenues of the IPA/Physician Groups. Revenue is paid monthly and is a flat fixed rate determined by the agreement. In addition to Management Fees, there is revenue generated through consultant services that are charged as a flat fixed rate and represent a small portion of the total revenue.
Our Key Payors
 A limited number of payors represent a significant portion of our net capitation revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, two payors accounted for an aggregate of 23% of our total net capitation revenue and in 2022 we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from these two payors.
Our Key Customers
 In 2020, the largest two SaaS customers represented 24% of revenues during that period.
 Our Strengths and Advantages
 The combination of the four companies fuses a healthcare information technology company with medical management companies to form a unique, scalable operating platform that we believe is well positioned for the ongoing transition of U.S. healthcare from fee-for-service payments to value-based reimbursements, including full-risk, global capitation models. The platform also addresses another major theme in U.S. healthcare: faced with mounting costs, shifting regulations and burdensome billing, reporting and technology requirements, many physicians and medical groups have been selling their practices to larger hospital systems. The strategy of the combined company is to be one of the few, technology-enabled national medical groups by acquiring and/or operating medical groups, independent practice associations (“IPAs”), accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), management services organizations (“MSOs”) and individual practices, allowing providers to focus on providing the best quality of care to their patients.
Regulatory Environment
 The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:

• | the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Anti-Kickback Act;
--+-------------------------------


• | the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act;
--+------------------------------


• | reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or PPACA
Our revenue will be dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or PPACA made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.
  Protected Health Information (PHI)
HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, which includes us.
 Because of the extreme sensitivity of the PHI we store and transmit, the security features of our technology platform are very important. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive client and patient data, including HIPAA-regulated PHI.
 Corporate Practice of Medicine
 Our consolidated financial statements include our subsidiaries and VIE. Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners, such as Clinigence and its subsidiaries, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, or exercising control over medical decisions by physicians. These laws are generally referred to as corporate practice of medicine laws. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws permit only physicians to practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions or engage in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In these states, a violation of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition constitutes the unlawful practice of medicine, which is a public offense punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. In addition, any physician who participates in a scheme that violates the state’s corporate practice of medicine prohibition may be punished for aiding and abetting a lay entity in the unlawful practice of medicine.
 California is a corporate practice of medicine state, and we operate our California based subsidiary AHP by maintaining a long-term MSA with our affiliated IPA, which is owned and operated by physicians only, and employs or contracts with additional physicians to provide medical services. Under the MSA, our wholly owned MSO is contracted to provide non-medical management and administrative services such as financial and risk management as well as information systems, marketing and administrative support to the IPA. The MSA has an initial term of 20 years and is generally not terminable by our affiliated IPA except in the case of bankruptcy, gross negligence, fraud, or other illegal acts by the contracting MSO.
 Through the MSA, we have exclusive authority over all non-medical decisions related to the ongoing business operations of the affiliated IPA. Consequently, Clinigence consolidates the revenue and expenses of the affiliated IPA as their primary beneficiary from the date of execution of the MSA.
 Under this arrangement our MSO performs only non-medical functions, does not represent to offer medical services, and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by physicians. The California Medical Board, as well as other states' regulatory bodies, has taken the position that MSAs that confer too much control over a physician practice to MSOs may violate the prohibition against corporate practice of medicine. Some of the relevant laws, regulations, and agency interpretations in California and other states that have corporate practice prohibitions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. Moreover, state laws are subject to change and regulatory authorities. Other parties, including our affiliated IPA, may assert that, despite these arrangements, Clinigence and its subsidiaries are engaged in the prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that such arrangements constitute unlawful fee-splitting between physicians and non-physicians. If this occurred, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our MSA could be found legally invalid and unenforceable in whole or in part, and we could be required to restructure arrangements with our affiliated IPA. If we were required to change our operating structures due to determination that a corporate practice of medicine violation existed, such a restructuring might require revising our MSA terms.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to Our General Business and Operations
 If our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered effective, our business and stock price could be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards.. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and strain our personnel, systems, and resources.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to make a formal assessment and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, resources, including accounting-related costs and management oversight.
 Additionally, current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to maintain or develop effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
 Uncertain or adverse economic conditions could adversely impact us.
 A downturn in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, and stock price. Historically, government budget limitations have resulted in reduced spending. Given that Medicaid is a significant component of state budgets, an economic downturn would put continued cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for healthcare services in California. The existing federal deficit and continued deficit spending by the federal government can lead to reduced government expenditures, including for government-funded programs in which we participate such as Medicare. An economic downturn and sustained unemployment may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs and the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates. Although we attempt to stay informed, any sustained failure to identify and respond to these trends could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business, and prospects.

Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock.
 From time to time, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that future deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our business strategy and performance may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflicts, including the conflict in Ukraine, may also adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock.
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may impact certain aspects of our business, financial condition, results of operation, and growth.
 The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures introduced by local, state, and federal governments to contain the virus and mitigate its public health effects have created significant impact to the global economy. We expect the evolving COVID-19 pandemic to continue to impact certain aspects of our business, results of operations, and financial condition and liquidity, but given the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the pandemic, we cannot accurately predict at this time the future potential impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
 Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 impacted certain aspects of our business as community self-isolation practices and shelter-in-place requirements reduced our inpatient visits. Continued shelter-in-place, quarantine, executive order, or related measures to combat the spread of COVID-19, as well as the perceived need by individuals to continue such practices to avoid infection, among other factors, have impacted and are expected to continue to impact certain aspects of our results of operations, business, and financial condition. These measures and practices resulted in temporary closures of outpatient clinics, and may result in delays in entry into new markets and expansion in existing markets. Governmental authorities in California began reopening and lifting or relaxing shelter-in-place and quarantine measures only to revert back to such restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. In addition, due to the shelter-in-place orders across the country, we have implemented work-from-home policies for many employees, which may impact productivity and disrupt our business operations.
 Healthcare organizations around the world, including our medical offices, have faced, and will continue to face, substantial challenges in treating patients with COVID-19, such as the diversion of hospital staff and resources from ordinary functions to the treatment of COVID-19, supply, resource, and capital shortages, and overburdening of staff and resource capacity. In the United States, governmental authorities have also recommended, and in certain cases required, that elective, specialty, and other procedures and appointments, including certain primary care services, be suspended or canceled to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19, and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19. Some of these measures and challenges will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and will harm the results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition of these healthcare organizations, including certain of our health network partners. We cannot accurately predict at this time the ultimate severity or duration that the foregoing measures and challenges may have on these healthcare organizations, including us and our health network partners.

The COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises could also diminish the public’s trust in healthcare facilities, especially facilities that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. As certain of our medical offices treat patients with COVID-19 or other infectious disease, patients may be discouraged from visiting our offices, including cancelling appointments.
 Our affiliated physician groups also face an increased risk of infection with COVID-19, which may result in staffing shortages at our offices or increased workers’ compensation claims. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, the widespread pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, potentially reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
 The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We cannot at this time precisely predict what effects the COVID-19 outbreak will have on certain aspects of our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including due to uncertainties relating to the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, and the governmental responses to the pandemic.
 If there is a change in accounting principles or the interpretation thereof affecting consolidation of VIEs, it could impact our consolidation of total revenues derived from our affiliated physician groups.
 Our financial statements are consolidated and include the accounts of our majority-wholly owned AHP subsidiary and non-owned affiliated physician group that is a VIE, which consolidation is effectuated in accordance with applicable accounting rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Such accounting rules require that, under some circumstances, the VIE consolidation model be applied when a reporting enterprise holds a variable interest (e.g., equity interests, debt obligations, certain management, and service contracts) in a legal entity. Under this model, an enterprise must assess the entity in which it holds a variable interest to determine whether it meets the criteria to be consolidated as a VIE. If the entity is a VIE, the consolidation framework next identifies the party, if one exists, that possesses a controlling financial interest in the VIE, and then requires that party to consolidate as the primary beneficiary. An enterprise’s determination of whether it has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires that a qualitative determination be made and is not solely based on voting rights. If an enterprise determines the entity in which it holds a variable interest is not subject to the VIE consolidation model, the enterprise should apply the traditional voting control model which focuses on voting rights.
 In our case, the VIE consolidation model applies to our controlled, but not owned, physician-affiliated entity. Our determination regarding the consolidation of our affiliate, however, could be challenged, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, in the event of a change in accounting rules or FASB’s interpretations thereof, or if there were an adverse determination by a regulatory agency or a court or a change in state or federal law relating to the ability to maintain present agreements or arrangements with our affiliated physician group, we may not be permitted to continue to consolidate the revenues of our VIE.

Our business will be subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, health epidemics or pandemics, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism. 
 We expect to have facilities located in the Southeast United States, including Florida, a region known for hurricane activity and Los Angeles California, a region known for earthquakes and wildfires. A significant natural disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, wildfire,or flood, occurring at our headquarters, at one of our other facilities or where a business partner is located could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster, health epidemics or pandemic, or man-made problem were to affect our network service providers or Internet service providers, this could adversely affect the ability of our customers to use our products and platform. In addition, health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters and acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business, or the businesses of our customers or service providers. We also expect to rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications and internal technology systems for our engineering, sales and marketing and operations activities. Although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a health epidemic or pandemic, natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Breaches or compromises of our information security systems or our information technology systems or infrastructure could result in exposure of private information, disruption of our business, and damage to our reputation, which could harm our business, results of operation, and financial condition
 As a routine part of our business, we utilize information security and information technology systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or private information regarding our patients, employees, vendors, and others, including individually identifiable health information. A security breach of our network, hosted service providers, or vendor systems, may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks, including on companies within the healthcare industry. Although we believe that we take appropriate measures to safeguard sensitive information within our possession, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks targeted at us, our patients, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. We invest in industry-standard security technology to protect personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect personal information or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical failures. To our knowledge, we have not experienced any material breach of our cybersecurity systems. If we or our third-party service providers systems fail to operate effectively or are damaged, destroyed, or shut down, or there are problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or there are security breaches in these systems, any of the aforementioned could occur as a result of natural disasters, software or equipment failures, telecommunications failures, loss or theft of equipment, acts of terrorism, circumvention of security systems, or other cyberattacks, we could experience delays or decreases in service, and reduced efficiency of our operations. Additionally, any of these events could lead to violations of privacy laws, loss of customers, or loss, misappropriation or corruption of confidential information, trade secrets or data, which could expose us to potential litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions, or other statutory penalties, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and cause it to incur significant losses and remediation costs.
 We rely on complex software systems and hosted applications to operate our business, and our business may be disrupted if we are unable to successfully or efficiently update these systems or convert to new systems. 
 We are increasingly dependent on technology systems to operate our business, reduce costs, and enhance customer service. These systems include complex software systems and hosted applications that are provided by third parties. Software systems need to be updated on a regular basis with patches, bug fixes, and other modifications. Hosted applications are subject to service availability and reliability of hosting environments. We also migrate from legacy systems to new systems from time to time. Maintaining existing software systems, implementing upgrades, and converting to new systems are costly and require personnel and other resources. The implementation of these systems upgrades, and conversions is a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation activities, consultants, system hardware and software, often requires transforming our current business and processes to conform to new systems, and therefore, may take longer, be more disruptive, and cost more than forecast and may not be successful. If the implementation is delayed or otherwise is not successful, it may hinder our business operations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are many factors that may materially and adversely affect the schedule, cost, and execution of the implementation process, including, without limitation, problems in the design and testing of new systems; system delays and malfunctions; the deviation by suppliers and contractors from the required performance under their contracts with us; the diversion of management attention from our daily operations to the implementation project; reworks due to unanticipated changes in business processes; difficulty in training employees in the operation of new systems and maintaining internal control while converting from legacy systems to new systems; and integration with our existing systems. Some of such factors may not be reasonably anticipated or may be beyond our control.

We may be unable to renew our leases on favorable terms or at all as our leases expire, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 We operate several leased premises. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to occupy such premises in the future. We may be unable to timely renew such leases or renew them on favorable terms, if at all. If any current lease is terminated or not renewed, we may be required to relocate our operations at
 substantial costs or incur increased rental expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 We currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues in California and are vulnerable to changes in that state.
 We primarily operate in California. Any material changes with respect to consumer preferences, taxation, reimbursements, financial requirements, or other aspects of the healthcare delivery in California or the state’s economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Our success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to adapt to the ever-changing healthcare industry and continued development of additional services.
 Although we expect to provide a broad and competitive range of services, there can be no assurance of acceptance of current services by the marketplace. Our ability to procure new contracts may be dependent upon the continuing results achieved at the current facilities, upon pricing and operational considerations, and the potential need for continuing improvement to our existing services. Moreover, the markets for our new services may not develop as expected nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in marketing any such services

 The healthcare industry is highly competitive.
 We compete directly with national, regional, and local providers of inpatient healthcare for patients and physicians. There are many other companies and individuals currently providing healthcare services, many of which have been in business longer and/or have substantially more resources. Since there are virtually no substantial capital expenditures required for providing healthcare services, there are few financial barriers to entry the healthcare industry. Other companies could enter the healthcare industry in the future and divert some or all of our business. We also compete with physician groups and privately-owned healthcare companies in local markets. In addition, our relationships with governmental and private third-party payors are not exclusive and our competitors have established or could seek to establish relationships with such payors to serve their covered patients. Competitors may also seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions, which would have an adverse impact on our growth strategy. Individual physicians, physician groups, and companies in other healthcare industry segments, including those with which we have contracts, and some of which have greater financial, marketing, and staffing resources, may become competitors in providing healthcare services, and this competition may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position.
 We therefore may be unable to compete successfully and even after we expend significant resources.

New physicians and other providers must be properly enrolled in governmental healthcare programs before we can receive reimbursement for their services, and there may be delays in the enrollment process.
 Each time a new physician joins us or our affiliated groups, we must enroll the physician under our applicable group identification number for Medicare and Medicaid programs and for certain managed care and private insurance programs before we can receive reimbursement for services the physician renders to beneficiaries of those programs. The estimated time to receive approval for the enrollment is sometimes difficult to predict and, in recent years, the Medicare program carriers often have not issued these numbers to our affiliated physicians in a timely manner. These practices result in delayed reimbursement that may adversely affect our cash flows.
 Changes associated with reimbursements by third-party payors may adversely affect our operations.
 The medical services industry is undergoing significant changes with government and other third-party payors that are taking measures to reduce reimbursement rates or, in some cases, denying reimbursement altogether. There is no assurance that government or other third-party payors will continue to pay for the services provided by our affiliated medical groups. Furthermore, there has been, and continues to be, a great deal of discussion and debate about the repeal and replacement of existing government reimbursement programs, such as the ACA. As a result, the future of healthcare reimbursement programs is uncertain, making long-term business planning difficult and imprecise. The failure of government or other third-party payors to cover adequately the medical services provided by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Our business may be significantly and adversely affected by legislative initiatives aimed at or having the effect of reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicare and other government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies. In order to participate in the Medicare program, we must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements. These programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis. As a result, we cannot increase our revenue by increasing the amount that we and our affiliates charge for services. To the extent that our costs increase, we may not be able to recover the increased costs from these programs. In addition, cost containment measures in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicare reimbursement for various services. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 made numerous changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and other healthcare-related programs, including new systems for establishing annual updates to Medicare rates for physicians’ services.
 We may have difficulty collecting payments from third-party payors in a timely manner.
 We derive significant revenue from third-party payors, and delays in payment or refunds to payors may adversely impact our net revenue. We assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed payments. In particular, we rely on some key governmental payors. Governmental payors typically pay on a more extended payment cycle, which could require us to incur substantial expenses prior to receiving corresponding payments. In the current healthcare environment, as payors continue to control expenditures for healthcare services, including through revising their coverage and reimbursement policies, we may continue to experience difficulties in collecting payments from payors that may seek to reduce or delay such payments. If we are not timely paid in full or if we need to refund some payments, our revenues, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Decreases in payor rates could adversely affect us.
 Decreases in payor rates, either prospectively or retroactively, could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, and results of operations.
 Federal and state laws may limit our ability to collect monies owed by patients.
 We use third-party collection agencies whom we do not control to collect from patients any co-payments and other payments for services that our physicians provide. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 (the “FDCPA”) restricts the methods that third-party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. State laws vary with respect to debt collection practices, although most state requirements are similar to those under the FDCPA. Therefore, such agencies may not be successful in collecting payments owed to us and our affiliated physician groups. If practices of collection agencies utilized by us are inconsistent with these standards, we may be subject to actual damages and penalties. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 We have established reserves for our potential medical claim losses, which are subject to inherent uncertainties, and a deficiency in the established reserves may lead to a reduction in our assets or net incomes.
 We establish reserves for estimated IBNR claims. IBNR estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables, including the utilization of healthcare services, historical payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, changes in membership, and other factors. The estimation methods and the resulting reserves are periodically reviewed and updated.
 Many of our contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services. Such interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed. The inherent difficulty in interpreting contracts and estimating necessary reserves could result in significant fluctuations in our estimates from period to period. Our actual losses and related expenses therefore may differ, even substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If actual claims exceed our estimated reserves, we may be required to increase reserves, which would lead to a reduction in our assets or net income.
 Competition for qualified physicians, employees, and management personnel is intense in the healthcare industry, and we may not be able to hire and retain qualified physicians and other personnel.
 We depend on our affiliated physicians to provide services and generate revenue. We compete with many types of healthcare providers, including teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals, and other practice groups, for the services of clinicians and management personnel. The limited number of residents and other licensed providers on the job market with the expertise necessary to provide services within our business makes it challenging to meet our hiring needs and may require us to train new employees, contract temporary physicians, or offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to experienced professionals, which could decrease our profit margins. The limited number of available residents and other licensed providers also impacts our ability to renew contracts with existing physicians on acceptable terms. As a result, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected. Even though our physician turnover rate has remained stable over the last three years, if the turnover rate were to increase significantly, our growth could be adversely affected. Moreover, unlike some of our competitors who sometimes pay additional compensation to physicians who agree to provide services exclusively to that competitor, our affiliated IPAs have historically not entered into such exclusivity agreements and have allowed our affiliated physicians to affiliate with multiple IPAs. This practice may place us at a competitive disadvantage regarding the hiring and retention of physicians relative to those competitors who do enter into such exclusivity agreements.
 The healthcare industry is increasingly reliant on technology, which could increase our risks.
 The role of technology is greatly increasing in the delivery of healthcare, which makes it difficult for traditional physician-driven companies, such as us, to adopt and integrate electronic health records, databases, cloud-based billing systems, and many other technology applications in the delivery of healthcare services. Additionally, consumers are using mobile applications and care and cost research in selecting and usage of healthcare services. We may need to incur significant costs to implement these technology applications and comply with applicable laws. For example, the nature of our business and the requirements of healthcare privacy laws impose significant obligations on us to maintain privacy and protection of patient medical information. We rely on employees and third parties with technology knowledge and expertise and could be at risk if technology applications are not properly established, maintained, or secured. Any cybersecurity incident, even unintended, could expose us to significant fines and remediation costs and materially impair our business operations and financial position.

If we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, including changes to laws and regulations regarding or affecting the U.S. healthcare reform, our business may be harmed.
 Due to the importance of the healthcare industry in the lives of all Americans, federal, state, and local legislative bodies frequently pass legislation and promulgate regulations relating to healthcare reform or that affect the healthcare industry. As has been the trend in recent years, it is reasonable to assume that there will continue to be increased government oversight and regulation of the healthcare industry in the future. We cannot assure our stockholders as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any new healthcare legislation or regulations, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential new legislation or regulations on our business. It is possible that future legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures, or regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities at the federal or state level, could adversely affect our business or could change the operating environment of the hospitals and other facilities where our affiliated physicians provide services. It is possible that the changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, or other governmental healthcare program reimbursements may serve as precedent to possible changes in other payors’ reimbursement policies in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursements could lead to adverse changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Although we do not anticipate that a single-payer national health insurance system will be enacted by the current Congress, several legislative initiatives have been proposed by members of Congress and presidential candidates that would establish some form of a single public or quasi-public agency that organizes healthcare financing, but under which healthcare delivery would remain private. If enacted, such a system could adversely affect our business.
 Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Many healthcare industry participants and payers are consolidating to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. We expect regulatory and economic conditions to result in additional consolidation in the healthcare industry in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our partners’ organizations may grow. If a partner experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our products and services. In addition, as healthcare providers consolidate to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our partners of products and services that compete with our products and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Relating to Regulatory Compliance
 Laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties and restructuring.
 Some states have laws that prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in some arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. California is one of the states that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine.
 In California, we operate by maintaining contracts with our affiliated physician group, which is each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide physician services. Under this arrangement, our subsidiary provides management services, receives a management fee for providing management services, does not represent to offer medical services, and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physician or the affiliated physician groups. Accordingly, we do not directly own any equity interests in out affiliated physician group in California. In the event that the affiliated physician group arrangement is terminated, we are unable to enforce such arrangement, or the arrangement is invalidated under applicable laws, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and we may have to restructure our organization and change our arrangements with our affiliated physician group, which may not be successful.
 We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:
 
• | the False Claims Act, that provides for penalties against entities and individuals who knowingly or recklessly make claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs, as well as third-party payors, that contain or are based upon false or fraudulent information;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of the Social Security Act (emanating from the DRA) that require entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5 million or more from a single Medicaid program to provide its employees, contractors, and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state false claims acts and related statutes, that establish a new Medicaid Integrity Program designed to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse, and that increase financial incentives for both states and individuals to bring fraud and abuse claims against healthcare companies;

Any violation or alleged violation of any of these laws or regulations by us or our affiliates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.
 To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the OIG, have recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim or statement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
 The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.

The impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending in the US is currently unknown, but may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our revenue will be dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.
 The ACA, among other things, increased the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud, and abuse laws and encouraged the use of information technology. Several of these changes require implementing regulations which have not yet been drafted or have been released only as proposed rules.
 Such changes in the regulatory environment may also result in changes to our payor mix that may affect our operations and revenue. 
 In addition, certain provisions of the ACA authorize voluntary demonstration projects, which include the development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services and post-acute services for episodes of hospital care. Further, the ACA may adversely affect payors by increasing medical costs generally, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas. The full impact of these changes on us cannot be determined at this time.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Compliance with federal and state privacy and data security laws is expensive, and we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches.
Numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of personally identifiable information, or PII, including protected health information. These laws and regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, which includes us.
 HIPAA requires healthcare providers like us to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.
 HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations start at $100 per violation and are not to exceed $50,000 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.5 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.
 In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities or business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.

HIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.” If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.
 Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PII, including PHI. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our Clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability.
 New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.
 Because of the extreme sensitivity of the PII we store and transmit, the security features of our technology platform are very important. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive client and patient data, including HIPAA-regulated PHI. As a result, our reputation could be severely damaged, adversely affecting client and patient confidence. Members may curtail their use of or stop using our services or our client base could decrease, which would cause our business to suffer. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, penalties and regulatory actions for violation of HIPAA and other applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation, notification to individuals and for measures to prevent future occurrences. Any potential security breach could also result in increased costs associated with liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage that may have been caused by such breaches, incentives offered to clients or other business partners in an effort to maintain our business relationships after a breach and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences, including organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. While we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses in the amount of at least $3.0 million, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.
 We outsource important aspects of the storage and transmission of Client and Member information, and thus rely on third parties to manage functions that have material cyber-security risks. We attempt to address these risks by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle client and patient information to sign business associate agreements contractually requiring those subcontractors to adequately safeguard personal health data to the same extent that applies to us and in some cases by requiring such outsourcing subcontractors to undergo third-party security examinations. In addition, we periodically hire third-party security experts to assess and test our security posture. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures and other safeguards will adequately protect us from the risks associated with the storage and transmission of client and patient’s proprietary and protected health information.
 In addition, various states have enacted laws governing the privacy of personal information collected and used by businesses online. For example, California has recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. This law, in part, requires that companies make certain disclosures to consumers via their privacy policies, or otherwise at the time the personal data is collected. The Company will have to determine what personal data it is collecting from individuals and for what purposes, and to update its privacy policy every 12 months to make the required disclosures, among other things. Since this law is newly enacted and has not yet gone into effect, it is unclear whether it will have any material impact on the Company’s business and operations.

Healthcare providers could be subject to federal and state investigations and payor audits.
 Due to our affiliates’ participation in government and private healthcare programs, we are from time to time involved in inquiries, reviews, audits, and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing, and documentation requirements. Federal and state government agencies have active civil and criminal enforcement efforts against healthcare companies, and their executives and managers. The DRA, which provides a financial incentive to states to enact their own false claims acts, and similar laws encourage investigations against healthcare companies by different agencies. These investigations could also be initiated by private whistleblowers. Responding to audit and investigative activities are costly and disruptive to our business operations, even when the allegations are without merit. If we are subject to an audit or investigation, a finding could be made that we or our affiliates erroneously billed or were incorrectly reimbursed, and we may be required to repay such agencies or payors, may be subjected to pre-payment reviews, which can be time-consuming and result in non-payment or delayed payments for the services we or our affiliates provide, and may be subject to financial sanctions or required to modify our operations.
 Controls designed to reduce inpatient services and associated costs may reduce our revenues.
 Controls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our operations. Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals and other care providers to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost on a post-discharge basis. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the HHS that a provider is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization and should be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. The ACA potentially expands the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on its use, and, as a result, efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Utilization review is also a requirement of most non-governmental managed care organizations and other third-party payors. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by third party payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and any changes thereto may have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of our services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.
 We do not have a Knox-Keene license.
 The Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 was passed by the California State Legislature to regulate California managed care plans and is currently administered by the DMHC. A Knox-Keene Act license is required to operate a healthcare service plan, e.g., an HMO, or an organization that accepts global risk, i.e., accepts full risk for a patient population, including risk related to institutional services, e.g., hospital, and professional services. Applying for and obtaining such a license is a time consuming and detail-oriented undertaking. We currently do not hold any Knox-Keene license. If the DMHC were to determine that we have been inappropriately taking risk for institutional and professional services as a result of our various hospital and physician arrangements without having any Knox-Keene license or applicable regulatory exemption, we may be required to obtain a Knox-Keene license and could be subject to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

A Knox-Keene Act license or exemption from licensure, where applicable, is required to operate a healthcare service plan, e.g., an HMO, or an organization that accepts global risk, i.e., accepts full risk for a patient population, including risk related to institutional services, e.g., hospital, and professional services.
 If our affiliated physician group is not able to satisfy California financial solvency regulations, they could become subject to sanctions and their ability to do business in California could be limited or terminated.
 The DMHC has instituted financial solvency regulations. The regulations are intended to provide a formal mechanism for monitoring the financial solvency of a RBO in California, including capitated physician groups. Under current DMHC regulations, our affiliated physician groups, as applicable, are required to, among other things:
 
• | Maintain, at all times, a minimum “cash-to-claims ratio” (which means the organization’s cash, marketable securities, and certain qualified receivables, divided by the organization’s total unpaid claims liability) of 0.75; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submit periodic reports to the DMHC containing various data and attestations regarding their performance and financial solvency, including IBNR calculations and documentation and attestations as to whether or not the organization (i) was in compliance with the “Knox-Keene Act” requirements related to claims payment timeliness, (ii) had maintained positive tangible net equity (“TNE”), and (iii) had maintained positive working capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the event that a physician group is not in compliance with any of the above criteria, it would be required to describe in a report submitted to the DMHC the reasons for non-compliance and actions to be taken to bring it into compliance. Under such regulations, the DMHC can also make some of the Information contained in the reports, public, including, but not limited to, whether or not a particular physician organization met each of the criteria. In the event any of our affiliated physician groups are not able to meet certain of the financial solvency requirements, and fail to meet subsequent corrective action plans, it could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or removal of, its ability to do business in California. There can be no assurance that our affiliated physician group, such as our IPA, will remain in compliance with DMHC requirements or be able to timely and adequately rectify non-compliance. To the extent that we need to provide additional capital to our affiliated physician group in the future in order to comply with DMHC regulations, we would have less cash available for other parts of our operations.
 Our revenue will be negatively impacted if our physicians fail to appropriately document their services.
 We rely upon our affiliated physicians to appropriately and accurately complete necessary medical record documentation and assign appropriate reimbursement codes for their services. Reimbursement is conditioned upon, in part, our affiliated physicians providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided and the medical necessity for the services. If our affiliated physicians have provided incorrect or incomplete documentation or selected inaccurate reimbursement codes, this could result in non-payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors and result in recoupments or refund demands, affecting revenue already received.

Primary care physicians may seek to affiliate with our and our competitors’ IPAs at the same time.
 It is common in the medical services industry for primary care physicians to be affiliated with multiple IPAs. Our affiliated IPA therefore may enter into agreements with physicians who are also affiliated with our competitors. However, some of our competitors at times have agreements with physicians that require the physician to provide exclusive services. Our affiliated IPA often has no knowledge, and no way of knowing, whether a physician is subject to an exclusivity agreement without being informed by the physician. Competitors could initiate lawsuits against us alleging in part interference with such exclusivity arrangements. An adverse outcome from any such lawsuit could adversely affect our business, cash flows and financial condition.
 If we inadvertently employ or contract with an excluded person, we may face government sanctions. 
 Individuals and entities can be excluded from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violating certain laws and regulations, or for other reasons such as the loss of a license in any state, even if the person retains other licensure. This means that the excluded person and others are prohibited from receiving payments for such person’s services rendered to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, and if the excluded person is a physician, all services ordered (not just provided) by such physician are also non-covered and non-payable. Entities that employ or contract with excluded individuals are prohibited from billing the Medicare or Medicaid programs for the excluded individual’s services and are subject to civil penalties if it does. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General maintains a list of excluded persons. Although we have instituted policies and procedures to minimize such risks, there can be no assurance that we will not inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or that our employees or contracts will not become excluded in the future without our knowledge. If this occurs, we may be subject to substantial repayments and civil penalties which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, and financial condition.
 We may be subject to liability for failure to fully comply with applicable corporate and securities laws.
 We are subject to various corporate and securities laws. Any failure to comply with such laws could cause government agencies to take action against us, which could restrict our ability to issue securities and result in fines or penalties. Any claim brought by such an agency could also cause us to expend resources to defend ourselves, divert the attention of our management from our business and could significantly harm our business, operating results, and financial condition, even if the claim is resolved in our favor. We received six (6) shareholder demand letters from multiple plaintiffs’ securities law firms in connection with the Company’s proxy statement filed with the SEC on February 14, 2022. This demand letters requested certain additional disclosures in connection with the proposed Nutex Merger. We did not provide any further disclosures. As of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no further action has been taken by these shareholders and no lawsuit has been filed against us by these firms.
 We cannot preclude the possibility that claims or lawsuits brought relating to any alleged securities law violations or breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the proposed Nutex Merger could potentially require significant time and resources to defend and/or settle and distract our management and board of directors from focusing on our business.
 We may face lawsuits not covered by insurance and related expenses may be material. Our failure to avoid, defend, and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows.
 We are exposed to and become involved in various litigation matters arising out of our business, including from time to time, actual or threatened lawsuits. Malpractice lawsuits are common in the healthcare industry. The medical malpractice legal environment varies greatly by state. The status of tort reform, availability of non-economic damages, or the presence or absence of other statutes, such as elder abuse or vulnerable adult statutes, influence the incidence and severity of malpractice litigation. We may also be subject to other types of lawsuits, such as those initiated by our competitors, stockholders, employees, service providers, contractors, or by government agencies, including when we terminate relationships with them, which may involve large claims and significant defense costs. Many states have joint and several liabilities for providers who deliver care to a patient and are at least partially liable. As a result, if one provider is found liable for medical malpractice for the provision of care to a particular patient, all other providers who furnished care to that same patient, including possibly us and our affiliated physicians, may also share in the liability, which could be substantial individually or in aggregate.

The defense of litigation, including fees of legal counsel, expert witnesses, and related costs, is expensive and difficult to forecast accurately. Such costs may be unrecoverable even if we ultimately prevail in litigation and could consume a significant portion of our limited capital resources. To defend lawsuits, it may also be necessary for us to divert officers and other employees from our normal business functions to gather evidence, give testimony, and otherwise support litigation efforts. If we lose any material litigation, we could face material judgments or awards against them. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of the proceedings in which we are involved now or in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, and financial condition. We may also in the future find it necessary to file lawsuits to recover damages or protect our interests. The cost of such litigation could also be significant and unrecoverable, which may also deter us from aggressively pursuing even legitimate claims
 Our affiliated physicians are required to carry first dollar coverage with limits of coverage equal to $1.0 million for all claims based on occurrence up to an aggregate of $3.0 million per year We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us, our affiliated professional organizations, or our affiliated physicians. Liabilities incurred by us or our affiliates in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Insurance coverage generally must be renewed annually and may not continue to be available to us in future years at acceptable costs and on favorable terms, which could increase our exposure to litigation.
 Risks Related to Our Growth Strategy and Business Model
  Our growth strategy may not prove viable and we may not realize expected results. In order to grow our business, we plan to drive greater awareness of our affiliated providers and their offerings and adoption of our platform from enterprises across new vertical markets. We intend to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as well as in technological development, to meet evolving customer needs in these and other markets. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be successful in gaining new customers from any or all of these markets. We have limited experience in marketing and selling our products and services generally, and in particular in these new markets, which may present unique and unexpected challenges and difficulties.
 If the costs of the new marketing channels we use increase dramatically, then we may choose to use alternative and less expensive channels, which may not be as effective as the channels we currently use. As we add to or change the mix of our marketing strategies, we may need to expand into more expensive channels than those we are currently in, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have limited experience marketing our products and platform and we may not be successful in selecting the marketing channels that will provide us with exposure to customers in a cost-effective manner. As part of our strategy to penetrate the new vertical markets, we will incur marketing expenses before we are able to recognize any revenue in such markets, and these expenses may not result in increased revenue or brand awareness. We have made in the past, and may make in the future, significant expenditures and investments in new marketing campaigns, and these investments may not lead to the cost-effective acquisition of additional customers. If we are unable to maintain effective marketing programs, then our ability to attract new customers or enter into new vertical markets could be adversely affected.

We could experience significant losses under capitation contracts if our expenses exceed revenues.
 Under a capitation contract, a health plan typically prospectively pays an IPA, periodic capitation payments based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which an IPA manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that IPA. If our affiliated IPA is able to manage care-related expenses under the capitated levels, we realize operating profits from capitation contracts. However, if care-related expenses exceed projected levels, our affiliated IPA may realize substantial operating deficits, which are not capped and could lead to substantial losses. Additionally, factors beyond our control, such as natural disasters, the potential effects of climate change, major epidemics, pandemics, or newly emergent viruses (such as COVID-19), could reduce our ability to effectively manage the costs of providing healthcare.
 If our agreement with our affiliated physician group is deemed invalid or are terminated under applicable law, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially impaired.
 There are various state laws, including laws in California, regulating the corporate practice of medicine, which prohibit us from directly owning medical professional entities. These prohibitions are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or inappropriately influencing a physician’s professional judgment. These and other laws may also prevent fee-splitting, which is the sharing of professional service income with non-professional or business interests. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. We currently derive revenues from an MSA arrangement with our affiliated IPA, whereby we provide management and administrative services to them. If this agreement and arrangement is held to be invalid under laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and other laws or if there are new laws that prohibit such agreements or arrangements, a significant portion of our revenues will be lost, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 The arrangements we have with our VIEs are not as secure as direct ownership of such entities.
 Because of corporate practice of medicine laws, we entered into contractual arrangements to manage certain affiliated physician practice groups, which allow us to consolidate those groups for financial reporting purposes. We do not have direct ownership interests in any of our VIEs and are not able to exercise rights as an equity holder to directly change the members of the boards of directors of these entities so as to affect changes at the management and operational level. Under our arrangements with our VIEs, we must rely on their equity holders to exercise our control over the entities. If our affiliated entities or their equity holders fail to perform as expected, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements.
 Any failure by our affiliated entities or their owners to perform their obligations under their agreements with us would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our affiliated physician practice group is owned by individual physicians who could die, become incapacitated, or become no longer affiliated with us. Although our MSA with this affiliate provides that they will be binding on successors of current owners, as the successors are not parties to the MSA, it is uncertain in case of the death, bankruptcy, or divorce of a current owner whether their successors would be subject to such MSA.
 Our revenues and operations are dependent on a limited number of key payors.
 Our operations are dependent on a concentrated number of payors. Two payors accounted for an aggregate of 23% our total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and two customers accounted for an aggregate 24% of our total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. We believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of key payors, which may terminate their contracts with us, or our physicians credentialed by them upon the occurrence of certain events. They may also amend the material terms of the contracts under certain circumstances. Failure to maintain such contracts on favorable terms, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

An exodus of our patients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may also be impacted by a shift in payor mix, including eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.
 A material decline, in the number of patients that we and our affiliated physician groups serve, whether a government or a private entity is paying for their healthcare, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could result from increased competition, new developments in the healthcare industry, or regulatory overhauls. In light of the repeal of the individual mandate requirement under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (also known as Affordable Care Act or Obamacare) via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, some people are expected to lose their health insurance and thus may not continue to afford services by our managed medical groups. In addition, due to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. A shift in payor mix, from managed care and other private payors to government payors or the uninsured may result in a reduction in our rates of reimbursement or an increase in our uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease our net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs could also change the number of patients who participate in such programs or the number of uninsured patients. For those patients who remain with private insurance, changes in those programs could increase patient responsibility amounts, resulting in a greater risk for uncollectible receivables. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We are dependent in part on referrals from third parties and preferred provider status with payors.
 Our business relies in part on referrals from third parties for our services. We receive referrals from community medical providers, emergency departments, payors, and hospitals in the same manner as other medical professionals receive patient referrals. We do not provide compensation or other remuneration to referral sources for referring patients to us. A decrease in these referrals due to competition, concerns about our services and other factors could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and adversely impact our financial condition. Similarly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain preferred provider status with significant third-party payors in the communities where we operate. If we are unable to maintain our referral base or our preferred provider status with significant third-party payors, it may negatively impact our revenues and financial performance
 Our business model depends on numerous complex management information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could undermine our ability to receive payments and otherwise materially harm our operations and may result in violations of healthcare laws and regulations.
 We depend on a complex, specialized, integrated management information system and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for our billing operations. We may be unable to enhance existing management information systems or implement new management information systems when necessary. We may experience unanticipated delays, complications, or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems. Our management information systems may require modifications, improvements, or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures, as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to create and implement these systems depends on the availability of technology and skilled personnel. Our failure to successfully implement and maintain all of our systems could undermine our ability to receive payments and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our failure to successfully operate our billing systems could also lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.

Consolidation in the health care industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Many health care industry participants and payers are consolidating to create larger and more integrated health care delivery systems with greater market power. We expect regulatory and economic conditions to result in additional consolidation in the health care industry in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our customers’ organizations may grow. If a customer experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our products and services. In addition, as health care providers consolidate to create larger and more integrated health care delivery systems with greater market power, these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our customers of products and services that compete with our products and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our use of “open source” software could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation. 
 We use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code, which could include valuable proprietary code of the user, on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours. 
 The security of our platform, networks or computer systems may be breached, and any unauthorized access to our customer data will have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. 
 The use of our platform will involve the storage, transmission and processing of our clients’ private data, and this data may contain confidential and proprietary information of our clients or other personal or identifying information regarding our clients, their employees or other persons. Individuals or entities may attempt to penetrate our network or platform security, or that of our third-party hosting and storage providers, and could gain access to our clients’ private data, which could result in the destruction, disclosure or misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information of our clients’ or their customers, employees and business partners. If any of our clients’ private data is leaked, obtained by others or destroyed without authorization, it could harm our reputation, we could be exposed to civil and criminal liability, and we may lose our ability to access private data, which will adversely affect the quality and performance of our platform. 
 In addition, our platform may be subject to computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks, all of which have become more prevalent in our industry. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, they may include the theft or destruction of data owned by us or our customers, and/or damage to our platform. Any failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security and availability of our products or services and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our customers may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new users.

While we will implement procedures and safeguards that are designed to prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, they may not be able to protect against all attempts to breach our systems, and we may not become aware in a timely manner of any such security breach. Unauthorized access to or security breaches of our platform, network or computer systems, or those of our technology service providers, could result in the loss of business, reputational damage, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, civil and criminal penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations or contractual obligations, and significant costs, fees and other monetary payments for remediation. If customers believe that our platform does not provide adequate security for the storage of sensitive information or its transmission over the Internet, our business will be harmed. Customers’ concerns about security or privacy may deter them from using our platform for activities that involve personal or other sensitive information.
 We could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brand and the proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and foreign jurisdictions so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. Clinigence Health Inc. owns U.S. Patent Application No. 15/882,688, which is a utility patent application currently pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Any patents that have been applied for or that may be issued in the future may not provide significant protection for our intellectual property. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 The particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, or our business decisions about when to file patent applications and trademark applications, may not be adequate to protect our business. We could be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights or those of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, result in a diversion of significant resources, lead to the narrowing or invalidation of portions of our intellectual property and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or alleging that we infringe the counterclaimant’s own intellectual property. Any of our patents, patent applications, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. 
 We expect to also rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our business partners, employees, consultants, advisors, customers and others in our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, processes and methods. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information, and it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy our software or other proprietary technology or information, or to develop similar software independently without our having an adequate remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in these cases we would not be able to assert any trade secret rights against those parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. 
 In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying, transfer and use of our proprietary technology or information may increase.
  
29
--

 
Our means of protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors could independently develop similar technology. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results.
Our success depends upon our ability to refrain from infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we grow and enter new markets, we will face a growing number of competitors. As the number of competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps, we expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to such claims by third parties. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. We cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future, or that, if asserted, any infringement claim will be successfully defended. A successful claim against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.
 The information that we expect to provide to our clients could be inaccurate or incomplete, which could harm our business reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.
 We expect to aggregate, process, and analyze healthcare-related data and information for use by our clients. Because data in the healthcare industry is fragmented in origin, inconsistent in format, and often incomplete, the overall quality of data received or accessed in the healthcare industry is often poor, the degree or amount of data which is knowingly or unknowingly absent or omitted can be material, and we frequently discover data issues and errors during our data integrity checks. If the analytical data that we expect to provide to our clients are based on incorrect or incomplete data or if we make mistakes in the capture, input, or analysis of these data, our reputation may suffer and our ability to attract and retain clients may be materially harmed.
 In addition, we expect to assist our clients with the management and submission of data to governmental entities, including CMS. These processes and submissions are governed by complex data processing and validation policies and regulations. If we fail to abide by such policies or submit incorrect or incomplete data, we may be exposed to liability to a client, court, or government agency that concludes that our storage, handling, submission, delivery, or display of health information or other data was wrongful or erroneous.
 Our proprietary applications may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to a variety of claims against us, or divert our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
 Proprietary software and application development is time-consuming, expensive, and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary applications from operating properly. If our applications and services do not function reliably or fail to achieve client expectations in terms of performance, clients could assert liability claims against us and attempt to cancel their contracts with us. Moreover, material performance problems, defects, or errors in our existing or new applications and services may arise in the future and may result from, among other things, the lack of interoperability of our applications with systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control or undetected in our testing. Defects or errors in our applications might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us. Correction of defects or errors could prove to be time consuming, costly, impossible, or impracticable. The existence of errors or defects in our applications and the correction of such errors could divert our resources from other matters relating to our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we are unable to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business will suffer.
 Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for highly skilled management, engineering, data science, sales and other personnel with experience in our industry. We must provide competitive compensation packages and a high-quality work environment to hire, retain and motivate employees. If we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, including the development, marketing and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we also may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information. If we are unable to retain our employees, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our Board of Directors may change our strategies, policies, and procedures without stockholder approval, and we may become more highly leveraged, which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations.
 Our investment, financing, leverage, and dividend policies, and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, capitalization, and operations, are determined exclusively by our board of directors, and may be amended or revised at any time by our board of directors without notice to or a vote of our stockholders. This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments, or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those contemplated in this private placement memorandum. Further, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that we may incur. Higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations. In addition, a change in our investment policies, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest, may increase our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Changes to our policies with regards to the foregoing could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 
 Our solutions face intense competition in the marketplace. If we are unable to compete effectively, our operating results could be adversely affected.
 The market for our solutions is increasingly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and is subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. Although we believe that our platform and the solutions that it offers are unique, many vendors develop and market products and services that compete to varying extents with our offerings, and we expect competition in our market to continue to intensify. Moreover, industry consolidation may increase competition.
 If we do not keep pace with technological changes, our solutions may become less competitive and our business may suffer.
 Our market is expected to be characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our existing solutions or new solutions that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with these technological developments, our business could be adversely affected. The success of enhancements, new features and solutions depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancements or new features or solutions. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our solutions are designed to operate on a variety of systems, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our solutions to keep pace with technological changes or operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.
 The Company’s success depends upon its ability to adapt to a changing market and its continued development of additional services.
 Although the Company believes that it will provide a competitive range of products and services, there can be no assurance of acceptance by the marketplace. The procurement of new contracts by the Company may be dependent upon the continuing results achieved with current clients, upon pricing and operational considerations, as well as the potential need for continuing improvement to existing services. Moreover, the markets for such services may not develop as expected nor can there be any assurance that the Company will be successful in its marketing of any such services.
