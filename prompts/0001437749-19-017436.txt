Item 1 - Business
General
 Founded in 1880 by Laroy S. Starrett and incorporated in 1929, The L.S. Starrett Company (the “Company”) is engaged in the business of manufacturing over 5,000 different products for industrial, professional and consumer markets. The Company has a long history of global manufacturing experience and currently operates 4 major global manufacturing plants. The one domestic location is in Athol, Massachusetts (1880) and the international operations are located in Itu, Brazil (1956), Jedburgh, Scotland (1958) and Suzhou, China (1997). All subsidiaries principally serve the global manufacturing industrial base with concentration in the metalworking, construction, machinery, equipment, aerospace and automotive markets.
 
The Company offers its broad array of measuring and cutting products to the market through multiple channels of distribution throughout the world. The Company’s products include precision tools, electronic gages, gage blocks, optical vision and laser measuring equipment, custom engineered granite solutions, tape measures, levels, chalk products, squares, band saw blades, hole saws, hacksaw blades, jig saw blades, reciprocating saw blades, M1® lubricant and precision ground flat stock.  The Company primarily distributes its precision hand tools, saw and construction products through distributors or resellers both domestically and internationally. Starrett® is brand recognized around the world for precision, quality and innovation.
 
In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280, Segment Reporting, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 (fiscal 2019), we determined that we have two reportable operating segments (North America and International). Refer to Note 17, Financial Information by Segment & Geographical Area, contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our reportable segments.
 
Products
 The Company’s tools and instruments are sold throughout North America and in over 100 other countries. The largest consumer of these products is the manufacturing industry including metalworking, aerospace, medical, and automotive but other important consumers are marine and farm equipment shops, do-it-yourselfers and tradesmen such as builders, carpenters, plumbers and electricians.
 
For 139 years, the Company has been a recognized leader in providing measurement and cutting solutions to industry. Measurement tools consist of precision instruments such as micrometers, vernier calipers, height gages, depth gages, electronic gages, dial indicators, steel rules, combination squares, custom, non-contact and in-process gaging such as optical, vision and laser measurement systems. The Company has expanded its product offering in the field of test and measurement equipment, with force measurement and material test equipment. Skilled personnel, superior products, manufacturing expertise, innovation and unmatched service has earned the Company its reputation as the “Best in Class” provider of measuring application solutions for industry. During fiscal 2015, the Company introduced material test systems consisting of hardware and cutting edge software with capacities up to 50KN, in addition to new manual and automated FOV (Field of View) measurement systems. These systems we believe will be attractive to industry to reduce measurement and inspection time and are ideal for quality assurance, inspection labs, manufacturing and research facilities.
 
The Company’s saw and hand tool product lines enjoy strong global brand recognition and market share. These products encompass a breadth of uses. The Company introduced several new products in the recent past including a new line of hand tools for measuring, marking and layout that include tapes, levels, chalk lines and other products for the building trades. In fiscal 2016 and 2017, the Company introduced new products to its hand tool portfolio to extend its reach into the construction and retail trades. The continued focus on high performance, production band saw applications has resulted in the development of two new ADVANZ carbide tipped products MC5 and MC7 ideal for cutting ferrous materials (MC7) and non-ferrous metals and castings (MC5). These actions are aimed at positioning the Company for global growth in wide band products for production applications.
 
As one of the premier industrial brands, the Company continues to be focused on every touch point with its customers. To that end, the Company now offers modern, easy-to-use interfaces for distributors and end-users including interactive catalogs and several online applications.
 
Personnel
 At June 30, 2019, the Company had 1,603 employees, approximately 51% of whom were domestic. This represents a net increase from June 30, 2018 of 31 employees. The headcount change included an increase of 2 domestically and 29 internationally.

None of the Company’s operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. In general, the Company considers relations with its employees to be excellent. Domestic employees hold shares of Company stock resulting from various stock purchase plans and employee stock ownership plans. The Company believes that this dual role of owner-employee has strengthened employee morale over the years.
 
Competition
 The Company competes on the basis of its reputation as the best in class for quality, precision and innovation combined with its commitment to customer service and strong customer relationships. To that end, Starrett is increasingly focusing on providing customer centric solutions. Although the Company is generally operating in highly competitive markets, the Company’s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by specific market since none of its competitors offer all of the same product lines offered by the Company or serve all of the markets served by the Company.
 
The Company is one of the largest producers of mechanics’ hand measuring tools and precision instruments. In the United States, there are three major foreign competitors and numerous small companies in the field. As a result, the industry is highly competitive. During fiscal 2019, there were no material changes in the Company’s competitive position. The Company’s products for the building trades, such as tape measures and levels, are under constant margin pressure due to a channel shift to large national home and hardware retailers. The Company has responded to such challenges by expanding its manufacturing operations in China.  Certain large customers also offer their own private labels “own brand” that compete with Starrett branded products. These products are often sourced directly from low cost countries.
 
Saw products encounter competition from several domestic and international sources. The Company’s competitive position varies by market and country. Continued research and development, new patented products and processes, strategic acquisitions and investments and strong customer support have enabled the Company to compete successfully in both general and performance oriented applications.
 
Foreign Operations
 The operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are consolidated in its financial statements. The subsidiaries located in Brazil, Scotland and China are actively engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of precision measuring tools, saw blades, optical and vision measuring equipment and hand tools. Subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and Singapore are engaged in distribution of the Company’s products. The Company expects its foreign subsidiaries to continue to play a significant role in its overall operations. A summary of the Company’s foreign operations is contained in Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Orders and Backlog
 The Company generally fills orders from finished goods inventories on hand. Sales order backlog of the Company at any point in time is not significant, however, as of June 30, 2019 backorders were approximately $6.6 million or $3.4 million below fiscal 2018. Total inventories amounted to $61.8 million at June 30, 2019 and $58.0 million at June 30, 2018. 
Intellectual Property
 When appropriate, the Company applies for patent protection on new inventions and currently owns a number of patents. Its patents are considered important in the operation of the business, but no single patent is of material importance when viewed from the standpoint of its overall business. The Company relies on its continuing product research and development efforts, with less dependence on its current patent position. It has for many years maintained engineers and supporting personnel engaged in research, product development and related activities. The expenditures for these activities during fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 were approximately $3.7 million, $3.6 million, and $3.5 million, respectively.
 
The Company uses trademarks with respect to its products and considers its trademark portfolio to be one of its most valuable assets. All of the Company’s important trademarks are registered and rigorously enforced.
 
Environmental
 Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. Specifically, the Company has taken steps to reduce, control and treat water discharges and air emissions. The Company takes seriously its responsibility to the environment and has embraced renewable energy alternatives and received approval from federal and state regulators in fiscal 2013 to begin using its new hydro – generation facility, an investment in excess of $1.0 million, at its Athol, MA plant to reduce its carbon footprint and energy costs.

Strategic Activities
 Globalization has had a profound impact on product offerings and buying behaviors of industry and consumers in North America and around the world, resulting in the Company revising its strategy to fit this new, highly competitive business environment. The Company continuously evaluates most aspects of its business, aiming for new ideas to set itself apart from its competition.
 
Our strategic concentration is building a global brand and providing unique customer value propositions through technically supported application solutions for our customers. Our job is to recommend and produce the best suited standard product or to design and build custom solutions. The combination of the right tool for the job with value added service gives us a competitive advantage. The Company continues its focus on lean manufacturing, plant consolidations, global sourcing, new software and hardware technologies, and improved logistics to optimize its value chain.
 
The execution of these strategic initiatives has expanded the Company’s manufacturing and distribution in developing economies, resulting in international sales revenues totaling 44% of consolidated sales for fiscal 2019.
