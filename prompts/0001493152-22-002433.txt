COVID-19
 
We are monitoring and responding to the evolving nature of state and local government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on each of our production plant locations as well as our customer base. We coordinate with our local managers for the primary purpose of maintaining the health and safety of our team members, ensuring our ability to operate our processing facilities, and maintaining the liquidity of our business. We continue to experience multiple challenges related to the pandemic. These challenges may continue to increase our operating costs and negatively impact our sales volumes.
 
Operationally, we have faced temporary idling of production facilities to ensure team member safety. As a result, we have experienced lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production. This will likely continue at least for the short term until the effects of the pandemic diminish. Both of our business segments have experienced a shift in demand from foodservice to retail. During the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021, the Frozen Food Products segment has seen a lessening of pandemic related restrictions on food service venues. In our Frozen Food Products segment, the recent sales volume increases in foodservice have not been sufficient to offset the losses in retail and as a result, we experienced decreased unit sales volume during fiscal 2021 in this segment. However, we were able to implement price increases on our products to cover higher input costs. Our Snack Food Products segment has experienced significant sales volume increases and commodity cost increases caused in part by supply and demand constraints related to reopening the economy from pandemic restrictions. The cost of significant meat commodities increased approximately $12,692 and the cost of purchased flour increased approximately $445 during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.
 
● Team Members – The health and safety of our team members is our top priority. To protect our team members, we have implemented safety measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) in our facilities and have implemented social distancing, temperature checks of team members, increased efforts to deep clean and sanitize facilities, the use of protective face coverings in certain environments, and making protective face coverings and other protective equipment available to team members. We encourage team members who feel sick to stay at home and provide relaxed attendance policies in some instances. We continue to explore and implement additional ways to promote social distancing in our production facilities by creating additional breakroom space and allowing extra time between shifts to reduce interaction of team members, as well as erecting dividers between workstations or increasing the space between workers on the production floor.
 
● Customers and Production – The most significant impact from business shutdowns relates to channel shifts and lower production in our Frozen Food Products segment. We are committed to doing our best to ensure the continuity of our business and the availability of our products to customers. During the last three quarters of fiscal 2021, we have started to see a shift in demand from our retail to our foodservice sales channels as schools and in-dining restaurants begin to reopen across the country. Our production capabilities, including our large scale and geographic proximities, allow us to adapt some of our facilities to the changing demand by shifting certain amounts of production from retail to foodservice. In addition, our production facilities were experiencing varying levels of production impacts, including reduced volumes, worker absenteeism and temporary COVID-19-related closures at some of our production facilities and may continue to experience these impacts.

● Supply Chain – Our supply chain has stayed largely intact. Although we have experienced some minor disruptions, these events have not significantly impacted our production to date. We have experienced volatility in commodity inputs, in part due to impacts caused by COVID-19 related business disruptions, and we expect this volatility to continue, which may impact our future input costs. Commodity costs increased approximately $13,137 during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.
 
● Insurance and CARES Act – Although we maintain insurance policies for various risks, we believe most COVID-19 impacts will not be covered by these policies. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of the employer portion of social security payments, and expanded income tax net operating loss carryback provisions. While we continue to examine the potential impacts of these actions, we anticipate new regulations related to federal income tax will have a significant impact on our financial statements and cash flow. Late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we began implementing the deferral of the employer portion of social security payments and intend to continue this deferral for the duration of its availability which will have a favorable impact on short-term liquidity. The deferral amount as of October 29, 2021, is approximately $1,511 with 50% due on December 31, 2021, and the remaining amount due on December 31, 2022.
 
● Liquidity – Operations used $5,992 in operating cash flows during the fifty-two weeks ended October 29, 2021. As of that date, we had approximately $44,638 of net working capital and $3,000 available under our revolving line of credit. On December 1, 2021, we expanded the revolving line of credit to $25,000 until June 15, 2022, upon which the credit limit will return to $15,000 for the balance of the term. Commodity price volatility or increases could adversely impact our business, financial condition including liquidity, and results of operations. Despite higher commodity costs, we may not be able to increase our product prices in a timely manner or sufficiently to offset increased commodity costs due to consumer price sensitivity, pricing in relation to competitors and the reluctance of retailers to accept the price increase. Higher product prices could potentially lower demand for our product and decrease volume. As of October 29, 2021, we have $1,065 of current debt on equipment loans. We entered into a bridge loan on August 30, 2021, for up to $25,000 which we plan to use to pay off the existing equipment loans as they come out of the lock out period and may be prepaid. As of October 29, 2021, we paid off $10,328 in equipment loans utilizing proceeds from the new bridge loan. Management believes there are various options available to generate additional liquidity to repay debt or fund operations such as mortgaging real estate, should that be necessary. Our ability to increase liquidity will depend upon, among other things, our business plans, performance of operating divisions, economic conditions of capital markets, or circumstances related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. If we are unable to increase liquidity through mortgaging real estate, or generate positive cash flow necessary to fund operations, we may not be able to compete successfully, which could negatively impact our business, operations, and financial condition. Combined with the cash expected to be generated from the Company’s operations, income tax refunds of $6,156, receivable on life insurance of $2,205 partially offset by payment on deferral of social security taxes, we anticipate that we will maintain sufficient liquidity to operate our business for a reasonable period of time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity and, if necessary, take action to preserve liquidity and ensure that our business can operate during these uncertain times.
 
Background of Business
 
Bridgford Foods Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Bridgford”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”), a California corporation, was organized in 1952. We originally began operations in 1932 as a retail meat market in San Diego, California and evolved into a meat wholesaler for hotels and restaurants, a distributor of frozen food products, a processor and packer of meat, and a manufacturer and distributor of frozen food products for sale on a retail and wholesale basis. Currently, we are primarily engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of an extensive line of frozen and snack food products throughout the United States. We have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings since inception nor have we been party to any merger, acquisition, etc. or acquired or disposed of any material amounts of assets during the past five years other than those discussed in Item 7 of this Report. Substantially all of our assets have been acquired in the ordinary course of business.
Description of Business
 
Bridgford currently operates in two business segments - the processing and distribution of frozen food products and the processing and distribution of snack food products. For information regarding the separate financial performance of the business segments refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
 
The following table shows sales, as a percentage of consolidated sales, for each business segment during the last two fiscal years:
 

 | 2021 | | | 2020
---------------------+------+-----+---+-----
Frozen Food Products | | 17 | % | | 21 | %
Snack Food Products | | 83 | % | | 79 | %
 | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
We manufacture nearly all of our food products and distribute an extensive line of biscuits, bread dough items, roll dough items, dry sausage products and beef jerky. Our direct store delivery network consists of non-refrigerated snack food products. Our frozen food products division serves both food service and retail customers.

Although we have recently introduced several new products, most of these products have not contributed significantly to our revenue growth for fiscal year 2021. Our sales are not subject to material seasonal variations. Historically we have been able to respond quickly to the receipt of orders and, accordingly, do not maintain a significant sales backlog. Neither Bridgford nor its industry generally has unusual demands or restrictions on working capital items. During the last fiscal year, we did not enter into any new markets or any significant contractual or other material relationships other than amendments to the March 16, 2020 Purchase and Sale Agreement with CRG Acquisition, LLC on each of February 1, 2021, April 28, 2021 and July 30, 2021, relating to the sale of a parcel of land including an approximate 156,000 square foot four-story industrial building in Chicago, Illinois.


Availability of SEC Filings and Code of Conduct on Internet Website
 
We maintain an Internet website at www.bridgford.com. Available on this website, free of charge, are our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto, and reports filed under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Code of Conduct is also available on the website.
 
Product Distribution Methods
 
Our products are delivered to customers using several distinct distribution channels. The distribution channel utilized is dependent upon the needs of our customers, the most efficient proximity to the delivery point, trade customs, and operating segment as well as product type, life, and stability. Among our customers are many of the country’s largest broadline and specialty food service distributors. These and other large-end purchasers occasionally go through extensive qualification procedures and our manufacturing capabilities are subjected to thorough review by the end purchasers prior to our approval as a vendor. Large-end purchasers typically select suppliers that can consistently meet increased volume requirements on a national basis during peak promotional periods. We believe that our manufacturing flexibility, national presence, and long-standing customer relationships should allow us to compete effectively with other manufacturers seeking to provide similar products to our current large food service end purchasers, although no assurances can be given.
 
The factors that contribute to higher or lower margins generated from each method of distribution depend upon the accepted selling price, level of involvement by our employees in setting up and maintaining displays, distance traveled, and fuel consumed by our company-owned fleet as well as freight and shipping costs depending on the distance the product travels to the delivery point. Management is continually evaluating the profitability of product delivery methods, analyzing alternate methods, and weighing economic inputs to determine the most efficient and cost-effective method of delivery to fulfill the needs of our customers.
 
Major Product Classes
 
Frozen Food Products
 
Our frozen food products division serves both food service and retail customers. We sell approximately 130 unique frozen food products through approximately 770 wholesalers, cooperatives, and distributors.
 
Frozen Food Products – Food Service Customers
 
The food service industry is composed of establishments that serve food outside the home and includes restaurants, the food operations of health care providers, schools, hotels, resorts, corporations, and other traditional and non-traditional food service outlets. Growth in this industry has been driven by the increase in away-from-home meal preparation, which has accompanied the expanding number of both dual income and single-parent households. Another trend within the food service industry is the growth in the number of non-traditional food service outlets such as convenience stores, retail stores and supermarkets. These non-traditional locations often lack extensive cooking, storage, or preparation facilities resulting in a need for pre-cooked and prepared foods similar to those we provide. The expansion in the food service industry has also been accompanied by the continued consolidation and growth of broadline and specialty food service distributors, many of which are long-standing customers. Orders from food service customers have started to increase as schools and in-dining restaurants start to reopen across the United States in response to the COVID-19 pandemic restriction changes.
Frozen Food Products – Retail Customers
 
The majority of our existing and targeted retail customers are involved in the resale of branded and private label packaged foods. The same trends which have contributed to the increase in away-from-home meal preparation have also fueled the growth in easy to prepare, microwaveable frozen and refrigerated convenience foods. Among the fastest growing segments is the frozen and refrigerated hand-held foods market. This growth has been driven by improved product quality and variety and the increasing need for inexpensive and healthy food items that require minimal preparation. Despite rapid growth, many categories of frozen and refrigerated hand-held foods have achieved minimal household penetration. We believe we have been successful in establishing and maintaining supply relationships with certain selected leading retailers in this market.

Frozen Food Products – Sales and Marketing
 
Our frozen food business covers the United States. Products produced by the Frozen Food Products segment are generally supplied to food service and retail distributors who take title to the product upon shipment receipt through company leased long-haul vehicles. In addition to regional sales managers, we maintain a network of independent food service and retail brokers covering most of the United States. Brokers are compensated on a commission basis. We believe that our broker relationships, in close cooperation with our regional sales managers, are a valuable asset providing significant new product and customer opportunities. Regional sales managers perform several significant functions for us, including identifying and developing new business opportunities and providing customer service and support to our distributors and end purchasers through the effective use of our broker network.
 
Our annual advertising expenditures are directed towards retail and institutional customers. These customers participate in various special promotional and marketing programs and direct advertising allowances we sponsor. We also invest in general consumer advertising in various periodicals, and coupons to advertise in major markets. We direct advertising toward food service customers with campaigns in major industry publications and through our participation in trade shows throughout the United States. Our advertising strategy includes our presence on social media and online distribution of promotional material.
 
Snack Food Products
 
During fiscal year 2021, our snack food products division sold approximately 170 different items through customer-owned distribution centers and a direct-store-delivery network serving approximately 19,000 supermarkets, mass merchandise and convenience retail stores located in 49 states.
 
Products produced or distributed by the Snack Food Products segment are supplied to customers through either direct delivery to customer warehouses or direct-store-delivery to retail locations. We utilize customer managed warehouse distribution centers to lower distribution cost. Product delivered to the customer’s warehouse is then distributed to the store where it is resold to the end consumer. Our direct-store-delivery system focus emphasizes high quality service and supply of our premium branded product to our customers. We also provide the service of setting up and maintaining the display and restocking our products.
 
Snack Food Products — Customers
 
Our customers are comprised of large retail chains and smaller “independent” operators. This part of our business is highly competitive. Proper placement of our product lines is critical to selling success since most items could be considered “impulse” items which are often consumed shortly after purchase. Our ability to sell successfully to this distribution channel depends on aggressive marketing and maintaining relationships with key buyers.
Snack Food Products — Sales and Marketing
 
Snack food products are distributed across the United States. Regional sales managers perform several significant functions including identifying and developing new business opportunities and providing customer service and support to our customers. We also utilize the services of brokers, where appropriate, to support efficient product distribution and customer satisfaction. We sponsor a fishing team which participates at the highest levels of both the Fishing League Worldwide (also known as the “FLW”) and Wild West Bass Trail.
Product Planning and Research and Development
 
We continually monitor the consumer acceptance of each product within our extensive product line. Individual products are regularly added to and deleted from our product line. Historically, the addition or deletion of any individual product has not had a material effect on our operations at fiscal yearend. We believe that a key factor in the success of our products is our system of carefully targeted research and testing of our products to ensure high quality and that each product matches an identified market opportunity. The emphasis in new product introductions in the past several years has been in single-serve items. We are constantly searching to develop new products to complement our existing product lines and improve processing techniques and formulas. We utilize an in-house test kitchen and consultants to research and experiment with unique food preparation methods, improve quality control and analyze new ingredient mixtures.
Competition
 
Our products are sold under highly competitive conditions. All food products can be considered competitive with other food products, but we consider our principal competitors to include national, regional, and local producers and distributors of refrigerated, frozen and non-refrigerated snack food products. Several of our competitors include large companies with substantially greater financial and marketing resources than ours. Existing competitors may broaden their product lines and potential competitors may enter or increase their focus on our markets, resulting in greater competition for us. We believe that our products compete favorably with those of our competitors. Such competitors’ products compete against ours for retail shelf space, institutional distribution, and customer preference.

Effect of Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that we manufacture, produce and process. Our processing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by the USDA and/or other federal, state, and local authorities. The USDA has issued strict regulations concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella and implemented a system of regulation known as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) program. The HACCP program requires all meat and poultry processing plants to develop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other program requirements. OSHA oversees safety compliance and establishes certain employer responsibilities to help “assure safe and healthful working conditions” and keep the workplace free of recognized hazards or practices likely to cause death or serious injury. We believe that we are currently in compliance with governmental laws and regulations and that we maintain the necessary permits and licenses relating to our operations.
 
To date, federal, state, and local environmental laws, and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, have not had a material effect on our business.
 
Importance of Key Customers
 
Sales to Wal-Mart® comprised 35.7% of revenues in fiscal year 2021 and 5.5% of total accounts receivable was due from Wal-Mart® as of October 29, 2021. Sales to Wal-Mart® comprised 36.9% of revenues in fiscal year 2020 and 19.8% of total accounts receivable was due from Wal-Mart® as of October 30, 2020. Sales to Dollar General® comprised 14.5% of revenues in fiscal year 2021 and 35.9% of total accounts receivable was due from Dollar General® as of October 29, 2021. Sales to Dollar General® comprised 13.6% of revenues in fiscal year 2020 and 31.1% of total accounts receivable was due from Dollar General® as of October 30, 2020.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We purchase large quantities of pork, beef, and flour. These ingredients are generally available from a number of different suppliers although the availability of these ingredients is subject to seasonal variation. We build ingredient inventories to take advantage of downward trends in seasonal prices or anticipated supply limitations.
 
Most flour purchases are made at market price without contracts. We also purchase bulk flour under short-term fixed price contracts at current market prices. The contracts are usually effective for a month or less and are not material to our operations. These contracts are settled within a month’s time and no significant contracts remain open at the close of the reporting period. We monitor and manage our ingredient costs to help negate volatile daily swings in market prices when possible. We do not participate in the commodity futures market or hedging to limit commodity exposure.
 
We continue to monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations including our supply chain and labor force. The pandemic could potentially cause disruptions to our supply chain. Global supply may be restricted causing price pressure on certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products which could disrupt our operations. We are unable to accurately predict the uncertainties related to the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic including overall economic stability, the spread, length and severity of the virus and any future governmental actions.
 
Employees
 
We had 699 employees (675 full-time employees) as of October 29, 2021, approximately 47% of whose employment relationship is governed by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements currently expire between March 2022 and February 2024. We believe that our relationship with all of our employees is favorable and that contracts will be settled favorably.
