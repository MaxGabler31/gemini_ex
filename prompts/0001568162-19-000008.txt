Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a diversified REIT focused on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of primarily service-oriented and traditional retail and distribution related commercial real estate properties in the U.S. We own a diversified portfolio of commercial properties comprised primarily of freestanding single-tenant properties that are net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants and, as a result of the Merger (as defined below), a portfolio of multi-tenant retail properties consisting primarily of power centers and lifestyle centers. We intend to focus our future acquisitions primarily on net leased retail properties. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 626 properties, comprised of 19.1 million rentable square feet, which were 94.7% leased, including 593 of net leased commercial properties (554 which are retail properties) and 33 retail properties which were acquired in the Merger. 
We are a Maryland corporation, incorporated on January 22, 2013, that elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our business is conducted through American Finance Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
On July 19, 2018 (the “Listing Date”), we listed shares of our common stock, which had been renamed “Class A common stock” in connection with a series of corporate actions effected earlier in July 2018, on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “AFIN” (the “Listing”).
To effect the Listing, and to address the potential for selling pressure that may have existed at the outset of listing, we listed only shares of our Class A common stock, which represented approximately 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, on Nasdaq on the Listing Date. Our two other classes of outstanding stock at the time of the Listing were Class B-1 common stock, which comprised approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock at that time, and Class B-2 common stock, which comprised approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock at that time. As of December 31, 2018, we had 106.2 million shares of common stock outstanding, comprised of approximately 80.0 million shares of Class A common stock and approximately 26.2 million shares of Class B-2 common stock. In accordance with their terms, all shares of Class B-1 common stock automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock and were listed on Nasdaq on October 10, 2018 and all shares of Class B-2 common stock automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock and were listed on Nasdaq on January 9, 2019. For additional information, see Note 9 — Common Stock and Note 16 — Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have no employees. We have retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. American Finance Properties, LLC (the “Property Manager”) serves as our property manager. The Advisor and the Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, and these related parties of ours receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing our business. Lincoln and its affiliates provide services to the Advisor in connection with our multi-tenant retail properties that are not net leased. The Advisor has informed us that the Advisor has agreed to pass through to Lincoln a portion of the fees and other expense reimbursements otherwise payable to the Advisor or its affiliates by us for services rendered by Lincoln. We are not a party to any contract with, and have no obligation to, Lincoln.
American Realty Capital — Retail Centers of America, Inc. Merger
On February 16, 2017, we completed the Merger, representing (a) the merger of American Realty Capital — Retail Centers of America, Inc. (“RCA”) with and into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and (b) the merger of American Realty Capital Retail Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “RCA OP”) with and into the OP, with the OP as the surviving entity (together, the “Merger”). RCA was sponsored and advised by affiliates of the Advisor. We issued 38.2 million shares of our common stock and paid $94.5 million in cash as consideration to complete the Merger. For additional information on the Merger, see Note 2 — Merger Transaction to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investment Objectives
We seek to preserve and protect capital, provide attractive and stable cash dividends and increase the value of our assets in order to generate capital appreciation by using the following strategies:

• | Retail Focused Portfolio, Including Single-Tenant Net Leased Properties — Acquiring freestanding single-tenant properties net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants, which are expected to primarily consist of service-oriented and traditional retail and distribution properties; however, we will not forgo opportunities to invest in other types of real estate investments that meet our overall investment objectives;


• | Long-Term Leases — With respect to net leased properties, enter into long-term leases with minimum, non-cancelable lease terms of ten or more years;

1


• | Low Leverage — Finance our portfolio opportunistically (taking advantage of opportunities as they arise) at a target leverage level of not more than 45% loan-to-value. Loan to value ratio is a lending risk assessment ratio that is examined before approving a mortgage and is calculated by dividing the mortgage amount by the appraised value of the property; and


• | Diversified Portfolio — Assemble, manage and optimize a well-diversified portfolio based on geography, tenant diversity, lease expirations, and other factors.

In addition, we may, at our discretion, originate and acquire commercial real estate debt investments, or invest in commercial real estate securities. 
Acquisition and Investment Policies
Real Estate Investment Focus
We own a diversified portfolio of commercial properties comprised primarily of freestanding single-tenant properties that are net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants and, as a result of the Merger, a portfolio of retail properties consisting primarily of power centers and lifestyle centers. 
Our investment objectives are (a) to provide current income for investors through the payment of cash dividends and (b) to preserve and return investors’ capital and to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We do not expect to make investments outside of the United States.
There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire. The number and mix of properties depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition of properties. 
Investing in Real Property 
We consider relevant real estate and financial factors when evaluating prospective investments in real property, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting it, the creditworthiness of its major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. Our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval and any guidelines established by our board of directors. 
The following table lists the tenants (including, for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants) from which we derive annualized rental income on a straight-line basis constituting 5.0% or more of our consolidated annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for all portfolio properties as of December 31, 2018:

Tenant | December 31, 2018
SunTrust | 8.7% 
Sanofi US | 7.0% 
AmeriCold | 5.2% 

Acquisition Structure
To date, we have acquired fee interests (a “fee interest” is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights) and leasehold interests (a “leasehold interest” is a right to enjoy the exclusive possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease) in properties. We anticipate continuing to do so if we acquire properties in the future, although other methods of acquiring a property may be utilized if we deem it to be advantageous. For example, we may acquire properties through a joint venture or the acquisition of substantially all of the interests of an entity which in turn owns the real property.
International Investments
We do not intend to invest in real estate outside of the United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or make other real estate investments related to assets located outside of the United States. 
Development and Construction of Properties 
We do not intend to acquire undeveloped land, develop new properties, or substantially redevelop existing properties. 
Joint Ventures 
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) for the purpose of making investments. Some of the potential reasons to enter into a joint venture would be to acquire assets we could not otherwise acquire, to reduce our capital commitment to a particular asset, or to benefit from certain expertise that a partner might have.
2

Our general policy is to invest in joint ventures only when we will have a right of first refusal to purchase the co-venturer’s interest in the joint venture if the co-venturer elects to sell such interest. If the co-venturer elects to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the other co-venturer’s interest in the property held by the joint venture. If any joint venture with an affiliated entity holds interests in more than one property, the interest in each such property may be specifically allocated based upon the respective proportion of funds invested by each co-venturer in each such property. 
Financing Strategies and Policies 
We have and expect to continue to use debt financing, when necessary, for acquisitions, property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness for future financings will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt. We expect to be able to secure various forms of fixed- and floating-rate debt financing, including financing secured by individual properties in our portfolio and corporate-level bank financing.
We will not borrow from our Advisor or its affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 
We may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. 
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
Competition
The net leased property and retail real estate markets are highly competitive. We compete for tenants in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail real estate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 
In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include Global Net Lease, Inc. (“GNL”), a REIT sponsored by an affiliate of AR Global, with an investment strategy similar to our investment strategy, other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, we seek financing through similar channels as our competitors. Therefore, we compete for financing in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease. 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.

Regulations 
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Environmental 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had no employees. The employees of the Advisor and its affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, and investor relations services. 
We are dependent on these companies for services that are essential to us, including asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources.
