Corporate History
 
Golden Developing Solutions, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was originally incorporated on December 17, 1998 in the State of Nevada under the name American Associates Group. In 2007 the name was changed to Clean Hydrogen Producers, Ltd before being changed in April of 2017 to Golden Developing Solutions, Inc. The Company has structured itself in 2017 as a cannabis holding company and intends to make additional acquisitions in the industry in the near future.
 
On April 27, 2018, the Company incorporated Pura Vida Vitamins, LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary. Pura Vida Vitamins, LLC entered into two consulting agreements with individuals that paid each consultant $6,000 per month in cash, additional bonuses depending on certain sales-related milestones, and 20,500,000 shares each for the completion of certain sales-related milestones, of which none were earned by either consultant. On July 1, 2018, the Company reorganized the entity to be a joint venture in which it owns 50%, in exchange for the cancelation of these consulting agreements. The Company continues to consolidate the operations of Pura Vida Vitamins, LLC due to its ownership interest combined with a controlling vote of the board of directors which make the Company the primary beneficiary of the joint venture with the ability to significant influence and control the activities of the business. As of August 8, 2019, the Company entered into a separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with Pura Vida Health LLC whereby pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Company sold its remaining 50% ownership interests in Pura Vida to Pura Vida Health LLC, leaving Pura Vida Health LLC as Pura Vida’s sole owner and only member in exchange for $160,000 (the “PV Purchase Price”). The PV Purchase Price shall be paid as follows: (i) $20,000 cash to be paid to an escrow agent whereby upon the satisfaction of the occurrence of certain events, the $20,000 is to be released to the Company and credited against the promissory note; (ii) the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $95,100 whereby the note will accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum, but only on the $75,100 portion of the note; and (iii) $65,000 cash payment no later than 12 months from the date of the Separation Agreement. The principal and interested on the promissory note shall be paid on a monthly basis starting on August 15, 2019 and for the next 11 months thereafter. The Separation Agreement marked the conclusion of the Joint Venture between the parties. None of these payments have been made as of the date of this filing, and there have been no operations of the joint venture in fiscal year 2020 or 2019. The joint venture is considered to be dissolved.
 
On September 26, 2018, the Company incorporated Tasos Media LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary.
 
On March 9, 2019, the Company incorporated CBD Infusionz, LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary.

This minimizes the costs of scaling and required capital while, at the same time, offering a direct role in the cannabis industry without ever touching the plant itself.
