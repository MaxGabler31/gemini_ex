Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 15, 2009. On July 25, 2014, we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Hydro Innovations, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Hydro Innovations”) from Stephen and Brandy Keen (the “Keens”). Hydro Innovations was founded by the Keens in Austin, Texas in 2006 to provide agricultural and other growers with the means to maintain a properly controlled indoor cultivation environment with customized, purpose-built cooling equipment, rather than repurposing conventional equipment made for comfort cooling. In 2011, Hydro Innovations delivered its environmental control system to one of the first commercial, state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities licensed to grow medical cannabis in Arizona.
 
As state laws regarding the use of cannabis have evolved, we have focused on designing, engineering and manufacturing application-specific environmental control and air sanitation systems for commercial, state- and provincial-regulated indoor cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Our engineering and technical team provides energy and water efficient solutions that allow growers to meet the unique demands of a cannabis cultivation environment through precise temperature, humidity, light, and process controls and to satisfy the evolving code and regulatory requirements being imposed at the state and local levels.
 
Our objective is to leverage our experience in this space in order to bring value-added climate control solutions to our customers that help improve their overall crop quality and yield as well as optimize the resource efficiency of their controlled environment (i.e., indoor and greenhouses) cultivation facilities. We have been involved in consulting, equipment sales and/or full-scale design for over 700 grow facilities since 2006 making us a trusted resource for indoor environmental design and control management for the cannabis industry.


Our customers have included small cultivation operations to licensed commercial facilities ranging from several thousand to more than 100,000 square feet. We have sold our equipment and systems throughout the U.S. and Canada as well as internationally in South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our revenue stream is derived primarily from supplying mechanical engineering services and climate and environmental control equipment to commercial indoor cannabis grow facilities. We also sell equipment to smaller cultivators who can purchase either directly from us, or from our authorized wholesalers or retailers. Though our customers do, we neither produce nor sell cannabis.
 
We are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.
 
Shares of our common stock are traded on the OTCMarkets under the ticker symbol “SRNA.”
 
Products and Services
 
System Design and Engineering Services
 
Our technical experience and know-how in designing indoor cannabis cultivation facilities allow us to deliver to our customers practical solutions to complicated problems in three primary areas: precision climate and environmental controls, energy and water efficiency, and building code and permitting. Our engineering design typically includes all mechanical components of a climate control system: cooling and heating, dehumidification, ventilation, air sanitation and odor control. We provide load calculations, equipment specifications, and engineered systems drawings for both the cultivation and comfort cooling portions of our customers’ facilities. We also have experience in, or knowledge of, state and local permitting and code compliance for cannabis facilities in states and provinces where cannabis has been legalized for either recreational or medical use, or is expected to be legalized.
 
Since 2006, we have been continuously improving our products and designs which we believe distinguishes us from our competition, including local heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) contractors, traditional HVAC design consultants, and others who may lack our cannabis-specific expertise. Traditional mechanical engineers, without our cannabis experience, are typically unfamiliar with the precise climate and air control requirements needed for cannabis cultivation. As important, they may be unable to effectively navigate the local code and permitting rules which did not contemplate cannabis cultivation facilities when enacted. With our engineering design resources and experience, we are able to provide a code-compliant mechanical plan set in any state or province by collaborating with local regulators and our customers to come up with creative solutions that not only meet the intent of the local codes but also address concerns about the growing energy and resource usage of these facilities.

Controlled environment cannabis cultivation facilities are energy intensive, with high density lighting and heavy HVAC requirements. We believe that cultivators who can reduce their energy consumption, and thereby energy costs, will be better situated to succeed in the increasingly competitive cannabis cultivation market, especially as more cultivators enter the market and the wholesale price per pound of cannabis continues to decline. Our engineering and technical sales team, which currently consists of eight people, is highly qualified and committed to delivering energy and resource efficient solutions to commercial cultivators. We recently augmented this team with the hire of a new Director of Engineering who is a licensed professional engineer and has over 10 years’ experience in mechanical engineering and environmental control systems design. In addition to our experience in meeting the demands of cultivation, our mechanical and climate control expertise includes cooling and heating, ventilation, dehumidification, air sanitation and exchange, and odor control, which we believe makes us one of the leading mechanical system solution providers for the indoor cannabis cultivation market.


We believe our experience in controlled cultivation environments, coupled with our ability to deliver practical solutions to unique and complex problems, allows us to deliver precise control of temperature and humidity at a reasonable cost, while optimizing energy, water, biosecurity and waste management. While data centers have high-intensity energy profiles similar to indoor cannabis cultivation, cannabis growers are moving more slowly toward energy efficient practices largely due to fears on how such changes could affect the quality of their product. Our goal is to design our application-specific chilled water cooling systems to achieve the targeted temperature, humidity, watering and lighting requirements of our customers and, while doing so, boost their return on investment (“ROI”) by reducing electricity costs. Electricity expense is an indoor cultivator’s highest recurring operating expense, typically representing an average of about 20% of overall operating costs. According to a report by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, an indoor grow system for only four cannabis plants uses as much energy as 29 refrigerators. According to this same report, 51% of an average cannabis cultivation facility’s total electrical consumption is for HVAC and dehumidification functions, and lighting consumption represents about 38%.


Apart from real estate and building construction costs, an indoor cultivation facility’s climate control and lighting systems often represents the highest start-up cost for a cultivator, accounting for about 32% of overall start-up costs. Median start-up costs for indoor cannabis cultivation facility are about $75 per square foot. We estimate the average cost of climate control systems for a 4,000-square foot plant canopy (i.e., the area dedicated to plant growing) at between $80,000 to $140,000, and between $500,000 to $875,000 for a 25,000-square foot plant canopy, depending on system design and options. Understanding the significant investment that our customers must make for their climate control systems, our technical sales and engineering staff are involved early in the sales process advising our customers’ management, architectural firms and installation contractors with technical, systems optimization, and other know-how.
 
While the cost of a climate control system can vary widely, these systems are also the single most important component for a cultivator’s growing success. The cultivator’s decision on a climate control system has far-reaching operating and economic consequences for years to come. An improperly designed system can produce ineffective temperature, humidity and ventilation control that can not only reduce yield, but also weaken the cannabis plant, making it susceptible to mold and insect infestation which, in turn, can result in crop loss. For a 10,000-square foot plant canopy facility, and assuming a wholesale price of $1,500 per pound, a single complete cannabis crop loss could mean lost revenue of between $600,000 to $1,800,000, with the variance depending on the cultivator’s yield efficiency which we estimate ranges from one to three pounds per 25 square feet of plant canopy.


We believe that plant quality, influenced by humidity, temperature and ventilation control, coupled with proper integrated pest management, will increase in importance as the cannabis industry grows, states become even more vigilant in regulating product quality and safety, and consumer demands evolve. Our experience has shown that our precision environmental controls can reduce the reliance on the use of harmful pesticides and fungicides. We believe our experience in the tightly regulated Canadian market where pharmaceutical-like testing protocols exist for filtration, air quality and post-harvest plant quality also gives us an advantage over our competitors, especially as product quality testing regulations continue to be enacted by state and local agencies.
 
With our focus on indoor commercial facilities, since 2015 we have designed environmental control systems for nearly 170 state-licensed, commercial cannabis cultivators. We leverage this experience to offer our customers a cost-effective system. By this, we mean the best value for a customer’s money for the “right” solution. We believe the “right” solution for our cultivation customers must provide tight temperature/humidity control, reduced mold, mildew and insect contamination risk (“bio-security”), minimized regulatory compliance risk, and lower maintenance complexity, costs and downtime. Our bio-security program uses a combination of a sealed facility and unique approaches to air sterilization to maintain facility standards while destroying harmful airborne microbes without the production of byproducts.
 
Our engineering design typically includes all mechanical components of a climate control system: cooling and heating, dehumidification, ventilation, air sanitation and odor control. We provide load calculations, equipment specifications, and engineered systems drawings for both the cultivation and comfort cooling portions of our customers’ facilities. We also have experience in, or knowledge of, state and local permitting and code compliance for cannabis facilities in states and provinces where cannabis has been legalized for either recreational or medical use, or is expected to be legalized.

Environmental Control and Air Sanitation Equipment 
 
We sell a wide array of environmental control and air sanitation equipment to our customers, including:
 

● | Chillers (in all capacities); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Energy recovery units; 
● | Fan coils and air handlers; 
● | Dehumidification equipment; 
● | Odor control and air sanitation equipment; 
● | Pumps; and 
● | Controllers (such as thermostats, nutrient temperature controllers and CO2 monitors). 

 
Some of our equipment is manufactured by third parties, such as chillers over 25-ton capacity, fans, carbon filters, pumps, air separators, expansion tanks, and air sanitizers. In some cases, we have private label arrangements with our third-party manufacturing partners where we have jointly worked to develop customized design features specific to indoor cannabis cultivation applications. Our other equipment is manufactured or assembled in-house at our Boulder, Colorado facility.
 
We believe we are a leading company in North America supplying a complete product line for environmental control and air sanitation systems for the indoor cannabis cultivation market. Since 2006, we have made it our mission to continuously expand our product line and improve the functionality of our equipment. Because of our market experience, we have gained valuable feedback and design insights from our customers, and we continue to innovate and respond as cultivation facilities have increased in both size and complexity.
 
The foundation of our climate control system is our application-specific chilled water cooling system design, which provides the cannabis cultivator with a more reliable and efficient thermal cooling solution compared to traditional HVAC systems that are designed for space comfort cooling but repurposed for cannabis cultivation. Our hydronic cooling systems rely on liquid, instead of air, as a medium for heat exchange, which can reduce the costs associated with cooling indoor cultivation facilities compared to traditional air conditioning products. The nature of the chilled water system allows for compressors (i.e., chillers) to be shared between grow rooms without exchanging air between rooms, which can reduce electrical infrastructure requirements and related facility start-up costs and improve redundancy. Our system also delivers chilled water through a closed loop and does not require traditional air conditioning ducting for heat removal, which can distribute contaminants and increase the risk of crop loss. Our simplified chilled-water systems are designed to mitigate crop loss due to equipment failure or contamination. And our systems can easily scale, allowing for redundant system design for a nominal increase in cost relative to traditional ducted HVAC systems, and are designed to minimize maintenance complexity, costs, and downtime.
 
New Product Initiatives
 
We recently formalized our new product development initiatives by establishing a new internal product development team led by our Director of New Product Development, who most recently worked for a global product safety and performance testing and certification provider, and supported by our new Director of Engineering.
 
This product development team is tasked with identifying, testing and developing new and improved products to complement our current mechanical and environmental control product offerings. As the cannabis industry evolves and more states and provinces legalize recreational and medical cannabis use, we believe the indoor cannabis cultivator will face new challenges and complexities and will look more to system design and engineering providers such as us for new technologies to gain a competitive advantage and increase their ROI. For this reason, we are expanding our system design and engineering services to include energy and utility modeling.
 
As the cannabis market expands, it is our intention to capitalize on leading-edge trends in facility automation. Controls can vary in scope from simple environment measuring devices to full-scale system automation, which could lead to higher crop yields, greater sustainability, more reliability and better bio-security – all of which are intended to improve the cultivator’s ROI. These products could include advanced thermostats with remote data applications, and a wide range of “smart” sensor-based technologies, enabling our cultivator customers to further capitalize on the increased automation of their climate control systems.

We have a contract with Sterling Pharms, LLC (“Sterling”), a Colorado-regulated cannabis cultivation facility principally owned and operated by Stephen Keen. Under our contract, which is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2018, Sterling has agreed to monitor, test and evaluate our products installed at the Sterling facility and to collect data and provide feedback to us on the energy and operational efficiency and efficacy of the installed products. We intend to use this information to improve, enhance and develop new or additional product features, innovations and technologies. We believe our access to performance metrics using a controlled testing environment will set us apart from our competitors who have limited access to actual grow data. The data collected is also expected to further our mission of striving to provide the best cannabis-specific climate control and air sanitation systems to optimize temperature/humidity control, bio-security safeguards, crop yield, and evolving sensor and automation technologies.
 
We will also consider strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that are consistent with our mission to bring new and improved products to the indoor cannabis cultivation market and that complement our current mechanical, environmental control and air sanitation product offering. As a public company, we may have an advantage over private companies in making such acquisitions, as we may be able to pay for a portion of potential acquisitions using our stock, allowing us to preserve our limited cash resources.
 
While we are focused on the foregoing new product initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify, test or develop new and improved products or complete any acquisitions. Further, in the event we are able to develop or acquire new products, there can be no assurance that such new products will generate revenue or profitability at the levels we expect. Accordingly, our efforts will be primarily focused on working with current and new manufacturing partners to jointly develop new and improved products with cannabis-specific applications.
 
Cannabis Industry 
 
The demand for our climate control and air sanitation systems, including system design and engineering, proprietary equipment, and third party manufactured equipment, is primarily influenced by the construction of new cannabis cultivation facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Due to continued uncertainty of the cannabis industry following the U.S. Justice Department’s announcement of its opposition to legalized cannabis in early 2017, and the January 4, 2018 rescission of the Cole Memo, we believe there may be an interim decrease in the development and financing of new cannabis cultivation facilities. However, this possible market effect is expected to be mitigated by California’s legalization of recreational cannabis use, which became effective on January 1, 2018, and the anticipated mid-2018 federal legalization of cannabis in Canada.
 
Recent and anticipated regulatory changes involving medicinal and/or recreational cannabis use in various jurisdictions, such as California and Canada, tend to be a leading indicator for the granting of licenses for new facility construction. As more new cultivation facilities become licensed, we in turn have an expanded set of potential customers that might buy our climate control systems.
 
For 2018, we intend to pursue customers seeking to build indoor cannabis cultivation facilities in all regulated markets, with special focus in California and Canada. In Canada medicinal use of cannabis is federally legal, and the Canadian federal government has indicated its intention to legalize recreational use by July 2018, although passage of recreational use federal legislation in Canada is not certain. We also believe that Michigan could offer opportunities in 2018 as the state attempts to move to a recreational use regulated market, with the second-largest medical cannabis patient base in the U.S.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our marketing efforts are targeted at owner/operators, investors and companies who are actively seeking licenses to produce cannabis and needing the professional engineering services that are required for the completion of license applications and/or permitting. As such, the projects we quote may not advance to the contract stage due to either a failure of our potential customer to receive licensure or to obtain project financing. In other cases, the successful licensee may have either been unknown to us at the time of application or elected to use a competing technology – e.g., a rooftop duct system or traditional split air conditioning system – as opposed to our ductless hydronic system.
 
Due to our market presence and experience, we receive frequent inbound inquiries for our products and services. We are, however, proactive in our outreach to our target market using industry trade shows and conventions and speaking engagements to achieve industry visibility and presence cost-effectively. In the past, we have attended most major trade and industry conventions including Lift Expo (Vancouver), CannaCon (Seattle), Cannabis Cultivation (Oakland), Lift Expo (Toronto), NCIA Cannabis Business Summit (San Jose), Cannabis World Congress & Business Expo (Los Angeles), CCIA/NCIA California Cannabis Business Conference (Anaheim) and the Marijuana Business Conference & Expo (Las Vegas). Brandy Keen, a principal shareholder, co-founder and Vice President, is often engaged as a speaker on climate control and energy efficiency by organizations such as National Cannabis Industry Association, Cannabis World Congress and Business Exposition and CannaCon and is frequently cited in industry-related publications. Ms. Keen is also a member of Denver’s Department of Public Health and Environment Cannabis Sustainability Work Group, whose mission is to promote sustainability in the cannabis industry through education, the development and dissemination of best practices, and the facilitation of dialogue between the cannabis industry, the community, and technical experts.
 
We are a part of the Founder’s Circle of Resource Innovations Institute (“RII”), with Brandy Keen being a member of their technical advisory committee. RII promotes and quantifies energy and water conservation in the cannabis industry. As a result of our Founder’s Circle status, we have access to RII’s data as well as speaking position opportunities at their seminars.
 
These programs give us industry exposure and allow us to showcase our experience in environment management for cannabis cultivation. With many new participants in the cannabis cultivation industry, we will also be able to provide existing and prospective customers with access to the Sterling facility for demonstration tours in a working indoor grow environment, which we believe may assist it in the sale of our products in the future.

The sales cycles for commercial projects can vary significantly. From pre-sales and technical advisory meetings to sales contract execution, to engineering services and equipment delivery, and all the way through installation and commissioning of the installed system, the full cycle can range from six months to two years. Since we do not install the climate control systems, our customers are required to use third-party installation contractors, which adds to the variability of the sales cycle.
 
The length of our sales cycle is driven by numerous factors including:
 

● | the large number of first-time participants interested in the indoor cannabis cultivation business; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the complexities and uncertainties involved in obtaining state and local licensure and permitting; 
● | local and state government delays in approving licenses and permits due to lack of staff or the large number of pending applications, especially in states where there is no cap on the number of cultivators; 
● | the customer’s need to obtain cultivation facility financing; 
● | the time needed, and coordination required, for our customers to acquire real estate and properly design and build the facility (to the stage when climate control systems can be installed); 
● | the large price tag and technical complexities of the climate control and air sanitation system; 
● | availability of power; and 
● | delays that are typical in completing any construction project. 

 
While our typical commercial project sales contracts are generally non-cancellable, based on the foregoing factors, there are risks that we may not realize the full contract value in a timely manner or at all. Completion of a sales contract is dependent upon our customers’ ability to secure funding and real estate, obtain a license and then build their cultivation facility so they can take possession of the equipment. In order to address these risks, we have three key milestones built into our contracts.
 
First, we provide our customer with engineering services and plans. In many cases, the engineering phase is done as part of the license application or building permit process and takes approximately six to eight weeks to complete. Our strategy is to secure the sales contract and commence the engineering portion of the project early in the customer’s planning phase of the project. This is important for a number of reasons: (i) we can assist our customers with their engineering and design plans as part of their licensing application process as well as better assure the customer has the right sized equipment for their application, leading to a higher probability of a successful grow, (ii) we are better positioned to utilize our technology for the project at an earlier stage, and (iii) we are able to help reduce a customer’s time to market. Before we commence the engineering phase of the project, we will generally require an advanced payment ranging from 5-10% of the total contract value.
 
Second, upon completion of the engineering phase, it may take our customer an average of five months to complete the facility build-out, with possible delays due to financing or other aspects which are beyond our control. Customer delays in obtaining financing and completing facility build-out make the completion timing of our sales contract unpredictable. For this reason, we require an additional advance payment equal to 40-55% of the contract value before we begin manufacturing our proprietary equipment items.
 
And third, the final phase of our contract typically involves the delivery of third-party manufactured equipment items and other equipment to complete the project. We typically will not deliver until we receive a final advance payment for the remaining 40-50% of the contract value. After the project is completed and the climate control system has been fully installed by third-party installation contractors, we will deploy our technicians to the customer’s cultivation facility to “commission” the system. Commissioning involves testing that the equipment has been properly assembled and installed by the installation contractor and assuring the equipment is operating within the agreed specifications.
 
Given the timing of the deliverables of our sales contracts, we can experience large variances in quarterly revenue. Our revenue recognition is dependent upon shipment of the equipment portions of our sales contracts, which, in many cases, may be delayed while our customers complete permitting, prepare their facilities for equipment installation or obtain project financing.
 
We have implemented a two-tiered sales model. The first tier involves direct sales efforts in various regions across the U.S. and Canada. We currently have three employees assigned to direct sales and one employee assigned to inside sales. Our inside salesperson handles inbound inquiries and typically handles equipment sales from smaller cultivators and hobbyists as well as our wholesale business. The second tier involves utilization of our two senior technical advisors and their expertise to complement the direct sales efforts.

-


Our direct salespeople are primarily focused on commercial project sales (typically in excess of 4,000 square feet of plant canopy, although some may be smaller) with each covering a specific geographical territory:
 

1. | the Northeast region (which includes eastern Canada); 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | the Pacific Northwest region (which includes Washington, Oregon, Alaska and western Canada); and 
3. | the West Coast region (which currently includes all of California). 

 
As the California market continues to develop, we are considering a number of strategies to make sure we have proper coverage in both southern and northern California.
 
Since August 2017, we have focused our efforts on expanding and better qualifying our pipeline of opportunities, increasing our bookings of new sales contracts, and improving our project management processes to shorten the time period from sales execution to project completion. To further these efforts, we have made investments to improve and add personnel in critical positions within sales, sales management, project management, engineering, and production. We also have improved our performance management and metrics to give better visibility about our customer pipeline, the expected timing of new sales orders, the completion of our active commercial projects and more defined departmental accountability.
 
We are in the process of completing facility improvement and expansion program, increasing our approximate square footage from 12,700 to 18,600, and increasing our production floor space from 5,900 to 9,200 square feet. We are reconfiguring our production processes and work flows in an effort to increase our production capacity and improve efficiencies. These actions are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, and they will be partially funded with a tenant improvement allowance being provided by our landlord as part of our new lease agreement.
 
We are also committed to continuing to improve our financial organization including, without limitation, expanding our accounting staff and improving our systems and controls to reduce our reliance on the manual nature of our existing systems. However, due to our size and our financial resources, these improvements have not always been possible and may not be economically feasible now or in the future.
 
We believe these investments are necessary to position us for our expected future growth. With the lengthy sales cycle, it may take six to 12 months or more before we can begin to realize a return on these investments. Nonetheless, industry uncertainty, project financing concerns, and the licensing and qualification of our prospective customers, which are out of our control, make it difficult for us to predict when we will recognize revenue. We continue to focus on increasing our sales contract backlog and quoting on larger (i.e., greater than $100,000) projects in an effort to increase revenue. We also will focus on leveraging our current market position and presence to build our pipeline in the California and Canadian markets, as well as other emerging U.S. markets. As sales opportunities are converted into contracts, we are preparing to meet our customers’ demand for timely delivery of a fully engineered, application-specific, climate control system.


Competition
 
Our climate control and air sanitation systems and our related engineering services compete with various national and local HVAC contractors and traditional HVAC equipment suppliers who traditionally resell, design, and implement climate control systems for commercial and industrial facilities and data centers, none of which have the specific knowledge that we have about the complexities and challenges of cannabis cultivation. We have positioned ourselves to differ from these competitors by providing engineering and climate control systems, based on our unique chilled-water cooling system design and equipment, tailored specifically for managing the distinct challenges involved in indoor cannabis cultivation. We believe our cannabis-specific applications and experience in this market allow us to deliver the “right” solution to our cultivation customers. Unlike many of our competitors, our solutions are designed specifically for cultivators to provide tight temperature/humidity control, reduce bio-security risk, and minimize maintenance complexity, costs and downtime. However, as the legal cannabis market continues to grow, we expect increased competition in both the climate control systems and engineering services with some of these competitors attempting to emulate our cannabis specific-application model.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark rights, trade secrets, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with our employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have several pending patent applications, which include a combination of Patent Cooperation Treaty, utility and design patent applications that are directed to certain of our technologies. We have registered trademark registrations around our core Surna brand (“Surna”) in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions, as well as the Surna logo and the combined Surna logo and name in the United States. Our wordmark is also registered in the European Union and Canada. Subject to ongoing use and renewal, trademark protection is potentially perpetual.

Operating Segments
 
We currently operate in one primary business segment, which encompasses designing, engineering, manufacturing, and distributing climate and environmental control systems for use in indoor cannabis grow facilities.
Employees
 
We currently have 35 full-time employees, however, we may utilize, and have in the past utilized, the services of a number of consultants, independent contractors, and other non-employee professionals. Additional employees will be hired in the future depending on need and our expansion.
Government Regulation
 
The use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by U.S. federal law. This includes medical and recreational cannabis. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly. This means that at any time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors understand that investments in the cannabis industry should be considered very high risk. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.
 
See the “Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry” set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report which addresses various risks related to U.S. and foreign regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws and regulations and their potential impact on our business.
