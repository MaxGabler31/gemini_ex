  Industry Background
 The number of people using the internet via computers, tablets, and smartphones continues to grow at a rapid pace. Consumers are embracing online and mobile transactions and banking in increasing numbers. Organizations of all types have an increasing number of employees and business partners accessing protected resources from remote locations. New business paradigms such as these introduce new security risks for participants, especially banks, merchants, and other online and mobile service providers. Large and powerful criminal hacking organizations are launching more sophisticated hacking attacks with greater frequency. The criminal activities of private and state-sponsored hacking organizations have driven an increased need for security solutions and expansion of regulations requiring improved security measures to protect against hacking attacks and breaches. Several governments worldwide have recognized the risk associated with using user name and password access for internet and mobile applications and have issued specific recommendations advocating multi-factor authentication for enhanced online and mobile banking security. We anticipate this trend may continue.
 We believe there are no reliable measurements of the total industry size or the industry growth rate for our security and eSignature products and services. However, we believe the market for authentication, anti-fraud and eSignature solutions will continue to grow driven by new government regulations, growing awareness of the impact of cyber-crime, and growth in electronic commerce. The issues driving growth are global however, the rate of adoption in each country is a function of culture, competitive position, economic conditions and use of technology.
 Our Background
 Our predecessor company, VASCO Corp., entered the data security business in 1991 through the acquisition of a controlling interest in ThumbScan, Inc., which we renamed as VASCO Data Security, Inc.
 In 1996, we expanded our computer security business by acquiring Lintel Security NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which included assets associated with the development of security tokens and security technologies for personal computers and computer networks. Also in 1996, we acquired Digipass NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which was also a developer of security tokens and security technologies. In 1997, the acquired entity was renamed VASCO Data Security NV/SA.
 In 1997, VASCO Data Security International, Inc. was incorporated and in 1998, we completed a registered exchange offer with the holders of the outstanding securities of VASCO Corp.
 In 2006, we opened our international headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.
 In 2013, we acquired Cronto Limited (“CRONTO”), a provider of secure visual transaction authentication solutions for online banking. 
 In 2014, we acquired Risk IDS, a provider of risk analysis solutions to the banking community. 
 In November 2015, we acquired Silanis Technology Inc., a leading provider of electronic signature (eSignature) and digital transaction solutions used to sign, send and manage documents.

 Our Products and Services
 DIGIPASS for Apps and DIGIPASS for Mobile
 Our DIGIPASS Software authenticators, DIGIPASS for Apps and DIGIPASS for Mobile are designed to provide our customers with increased security for access to their mobile applications and networks without having to carry a standalone hardware device. DIGIPASS software authenticators balance the need for stronger mobile application security with the demands for user convenience by delivering comprehensive, built-in security for mobile applications, combined with a frictionless, “hands-free” authentication and e-signing experience for mobile users. 
 DIGIPASS for Apps is a comprehensive software development kit (SDK) that allows application developers to natively integrate security features including geolocation, device identification, jailbreak and root detection, fingerprint and face recognition, one-time password delivery via PUSH notification, and electronic signing, among others. Through a comprehensive library of APIs, application developers can extend and strengthen application security, deliver enhanced convenience to their application users, and streamline application deployment and lifecycle management processes.
 DIGIPASS for Mobile is a user-friendly and secure mobile authenticator that operates as a discrete mobile application. It includes many of the features of DIGIPASS for Apps and can easily be tailored to meet the needs of any authentication process. It can be customized and deployed rapidly without extensive technical support ensuring strong security with compelling value.
 IDENTIKEY Risk Manager
 IDENTIKEY Risk Manager (IRM) is a comprehensive anti-fraud solution designed to help banks and other users improve the manner and speed of detecting fraud across multiple channels. It enables banks and financial institutions to take a proactive approach to fraud prevention, while making the experience frictionless for end users. IRM uses analytic techniques such as neural network implementations to score real-time transaction activity. Cross-channel prebuilt rules complement this score and allow fraud experts to make decisions on alerts or link to automated business processes such as step-up authentication. This solution can be implemented in combination with DIGIPASS for Apps to provide integrated trust with minimal impact on the end user experience. These products are targeted at banks, transaction processors, and ATM operations.
 Application Shielding with RASP
 VASCO’s application shielding with Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), neutralizes the threat of sophisticated attacks on mobile apps. It can mitigate malicious app activities before they interfere with the normal operation of the app and expose sensitive user data. This solution also provides code obfuscation and anti-tampering to stop hackers from debugging and reverse-engineering applications, ultimately reducing the risk of rogue apps.
 eSignLive eSignature
 eSignLive supports a broad range of eSignature requirements from simple to complex, and from the occasional electronic contract to the processing tens of thousands of transactions. eSignLive provides multiple deployment options including public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises, without compromising security or functionality. eSignLive is also available in a FedRAMP SaaS-level compliant cloud, allowing U.S. government agencies to implement eSignatures in the cloud and meet GSA security requirements. 
 Customers can configure eSignLive end-user to reinforce their brand for a seamless signing experience. Each step of the eSignature workflow can be customized, from authentication to e-document distribution. eSignLive can be

used across multiple devices, including laptop, mobile phone, or tablet, contributing to high levels of user adoption and satisfaction.
 eSignLive provides the most comprehensive and secure electronic evidence for the strongest legal protection by capturing both document and process-level evidence. This reduces the time and cost of gathering evidence and demonstrating legal and regulatory compliance. eSignLive electronic signature capabilities can be a critical component of the customer onboarding process for mobile applications providing a secure and user friendly way to capture customer signatures.
 eSignLive eVault Manager
 eVault Manager is a secure, web-based platform that provides mortgage lenders, auto financers, equipment lessors and other financial services organizations the means to store, assign and service electronic mortgage notes and secured loans and leases. The solution enables fully electronic, straight-through processing of mortgages and other secured loans and leases, from origination to retirement. After being electronically signed with eSignLive or another system, the authoritative copy of an eMortgage note or e-chattel paper is deposited in an eVault and protected throughout its lifecycle.
 eVault Manager can be deployed in a public cloud, private cloud or on-premise. It maintains a single authoritative copy that is unique and identifiable; securely manages the transfer of assignment and location; ensures records cannot be altered, except as permitted; provides secure access and authorization control; includes an administration console for managing, pooling, searching and auditing electronic records; and supports vault-to-vault transfers and secure output to paper.
 VACMAN
 Our VACMAN product line incorporates a range of strong authentication utilities and solutions designed to allow organizations to add DIGIPASS strong authentication into their existing networks and applications. VACMAN solutions integrate with the most popular hardware and software and once integrated, become largely transparent to users, minimizing rollout and support issues. VACMAN encompasses multiple authentication technologies (passwords, dynamic password technologies, certificates, and biometrics) and allows use of any combination of those technologies simultaneously.
 VACMAN enables customers to administer a high level of access control and allows them to match the level of authentication security used with the risk associated with each user of their application. Customers simply add fields to their existing user databases to describe the authentication technology used, and, if applicable, the unique DIGIPASS assigned to each end user of their application. VACMAN requires only a few days to implement in most systems and supports all DIGIPASS functionality. Once linked to an application, VACMAN automatically handles login requests from any user authorized to have a DIGIPASS.
 DIGIPASS Hardware Authenticators
 We offer a wide variety of DIGIPASS authenticators, each of which has its own distinct characteristics to meet the needs of our customers. All models of the DIGIPASS family are designed to work together so customers can switch devices without changes to their existing infrastructure. Our hardware DIGIPASS models range from simple one-button devices to devices that include more secure technologies, such as public key infrastructure (“PKI”). 
 With the acquisition of CRONTO in May 2013, VASCO added visual cryptography to its product portfolio. Sensitive transaction data is captured in a cryptogram that consists of a matrix of colored dots. By scanning the image with a hardware or software authenticator, the data contained in the cryptogram is decrypted and the transaction details are presented to the user for verification providing a highly secure method of visual transaction signing with maximum user convenience.

 Many DIGIPASS hardware authenticators combine the benefits of traditional password authenticators (authentication and digital signatures) with smart card readers. Together, they bring portability to smart cards and allow the use of secure time-based algorithms.
 DIGIPASS hardware technology is designed to support authentication and digital signatures for applications running on desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, and smart phones.
 IDENTIKEY Authentication Server
 IDENTIKEY Authentication Server is a centralized authentication server that supports the deployment, use, and administration of DIGIPASS strong user authentication. It is based on VASCO’s core VACMAN technology. IDENTIKEY is also available as a stand-alone appliance and as a virtual appliance. Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, design and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights. In particular, we hold several patents in the U.S. and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. These patents expire between 2019 and 2035. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe and other countries. The majority of our issued and pending patents cover our DIGIPASS product line. We believe these patents to be valuable property rights and we rely on the strength of our patents and on trade secret law to protect our proprietary technology. We furthermore have registrations for most of our trademarks in most of the markets where we sell the corresponding products and services and registrations of the designs of many of our hardware products primarily in the EU and China. To the extent that we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed upon, we intend to assert vigorously our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, pursuing all available legal remedies. Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts historically have been, and will continue to be, concentrated on product enhancement, new technology development, and related new product introductions. We employ a team of full-time engineers and, from time to time, also engage independent engineering firms to conduct non-strategic product development efforts on our behalf. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred expenses of $23.1 million, $23.2 million, and $17.5 million, respectively, for research and development. Production
 Our security hardware DIGIPASS products are manufactured by third party manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we issue. Our hardware DIGIPASS products are made primarily from commercially available electronic components purchased globally. Our software products are produced in-house.
 Hardware DIGIPASS products utilize commercially available programmable microprocessors purchased from several suppliers. The microprocessors are the most important components of our security authenticators that are not commodity items readily available on the open market. Some microprocessors are single sourced. Orders of microprocessors generally require a lead-time of 12-16 weeks. We attempt to maintain a sufficient inventory of all parts to handle short-term increases in orders.
 Large orders that would significantly deplete our inventory are typically required to be placed with more than twelve weeks of lead-time, allowing us to make appropriate arrangements with our suppliers. We purchase microprocessors and arrange for shipment to third parties for assembly and testing in accordance with our design specifications. The majority of our DIGIPASS products are manufactured by four independent vendors domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau with production facilities in mainland China. Purchases are made on a volume purchase order basis. We supply product test equipment at the point of assembly. We maintain a local team in China to conduct quality control and quality assurance procedures. Periodic visits are conducted by our personnel for quality management, assembly process review, and supplier relations.

 Competition
 The market for computer and network security solutions is very competitive and, like most technology-driven markets, is subject to rapid change and constantly evolving products and services. Our anti-fraud products are designed to allow authorized users access to a computing environment or application, in some cases using patented technology, as a replacement for or supplement to a static password. Although certain of our security technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer anti-fraud solutions that compete with us for market share. Our main competitors in our anti-fraud markets are Gemalto and RSA Security, a subsidiary of Dell Technologies. There are many other companies, such as Kobil Systems, Symantec, and Early Warning that offer competing authentication hardware, software and services that range from simple locking mechanisms to sophisticated encryption technologies. In addition to these companies, we face competition from many small authentication solution providers, many of whom offer new technologies and niche solutions such as biometric or behavioral analysis. We believe that competition in this market is likely to intensify as a result of increasing demand for security products. Our primary competitors for electronic signature solutions include DocuSign and Adobe Systems. Both companies are significantly larger than us. In addition to these companies, there are dozens of smaller and regional providers of electronic signing solutions.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for computer and network security products as well as electronic signatures include the strength and effectiveness of the solution, technical features, ease of use, quality and reliability, customer service and support, brand recognition, customer base, distribution channels, and the total cost of ownership of the solution. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors.
 Some of our present and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing, and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, or to deliver competitive products at a lower end-user price. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Accordingly, we have forged, and will continue to forge, our own partnerships to offer a broader range of products and capabilities to the market.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales staff coordinates sales activity through both our sales channels and those of our strategic partners making direct sales calls either alone or with the sales personnel of our partners. Our sales staff also provides product education seminars to sales and technical personnel of vendors and distributors with whom we have working relationships and to potential end-users of our products.
 Our sales force is able to offer customers a choice of an on-site implementation using our on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform.
 Part of our expanded selling effort includes approaching our existing strategic partners to find additional applications for our security products. In addition, our marketing plan calls for the identification of new business opportunities that may require enhanced security or areas where we do not currently market our products. Our efforts also include various activities to increase market awareness of solutions as well as preparation and dissemination of white papers explaining how our security products can add value or otherwise be beneficial.
 Customers and Markets
 Customers for our products include some of the world’s most recognized names: JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citibank, HSBC, Rabobank, Deutsche Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, BNP-Paribas Fortis, The Bank of 

 
  6

 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Banco Santander, and U.S. government agencies including the Postal Service, USDA, Census Bureau, and GSA.
 Our top 10 customers contributed 27%, 36%, and 50%, in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. In 2015, Rabobank contributed 30% of our worldwide revenue.
 A significant portion of our sales is denominated in foreign currencies and changes in exchange rates impact results of operations. To mitigate exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against operating expenses being incurred in that currency. For additional information regarding how currency fluctuations can affect our business, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”
 We experience seasonality in our business. Historically, these seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months, particularly in Europe, when many businesses defer purchase decisions; however, the timing of any one or more large orders may temper or offset this seasonality.
 We generally focus our sales and marketing efforts in three primary areas:

· | Financial Institutions, which includes Banking, is our largest market. We believe there are substantial opportunities for future growth in the financial vertical.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Businesses seeking secure internal and remote network access. We sell to these businesses primarily through distributors and resellers. Our strategy is to leverage products developed for the Banking market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Government: Our customer base includes a significant number of government organizations and we continue to experience positive growth in this market. This is primarily driven by our eSignature solution, eSignLive.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We serve multiple markets via our two-tier indirect sales channel. We invest in and support our channel with training, marketing and sales support resources. Distributors and resellers get the tools they need to be successful, such as campaigns, case studies, marketing funds and more. We train employees of our resellers and distributors on-site and in our offices.
 Backlog
 Our backlog at December 31, 2017 was approximately $48 million compared to $50 million at December 31, 2016 and $51 million at December 31, 2015. We do not believe that the specific amount of backlog at any point in time is indicative of the trends in our markets or the expected results of our business. Given the large size of orders, the backlog number can change significantly with the receipt of a new order or modification of an existing order. Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations
