Item 1. Business
 
MIND Technology, Inc. (“MIND” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”), a Delaware corporation, formerly Mitcham Industries, Inc., a Texas corporation, was incorporated in 1987. Effective August 3, 2020 the Company reincorporated in the state of Delaware. Concurrent with the reincorporation, the name of the Company was changed to MIND Technology, Inc., and the number of shares of common stock (“Common Stock”) and preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) authorized for issuance was increased. We provide technology to the oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic and maritime security industries. Headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, MIND has a global presence with key operating locations in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.
 
Historically, we operated in two segments, Marine Technology Products and Equipment Leasing. During the second quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”), our Board decided to exit the land-based seismic equipment leasing business (the “Leasing Business”) and instructed management to develop and implement a plan to dispose of those operations. Accordingly, the assets, excluding cash, and liabilities of the Leasing Business are considered held for sale and the Leasing Business operations are presented as discontinued operations. See Note 2 - “Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details.
 
Our worldwide Marine Technology Products business includes (a) Seamap Pte Ltd, MIND Maritime Acoustics, LLC (formerly Seamap USA, LLC), Seamap (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and Seamap (UK) Ltd, collectively “Seamap” which designs, manufactures and sells specialized marine seismic equipment and (b) Klein Marine Systems, Inc. (“Klein”), which designs, manufactures and sells high performance side scan sonar and water-side security systems. We have in the past, and may in the future, lease certain marine equipment to our customers. Such amounts have not been material in recent periods nor are anticipated to be material in the future.
 
We are focusing on our strategy to emphasize our Marine Technology Products business following the decision to exit the Leasing Business. This strategy is based on the following vision for MIND:
 

• | become known as a provider of innovative technology and products to the oceanographic, hydrographic, seismic, defense and maritime security industries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leverage our various technologies, products and services to create new products and address new markets, as well as seek out opportunities to add new technologies and products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create an organization that facilitates cross-fertilization of our existing technologies and market presence. We expect to leverage our engineering, sales, operations, manufacturing and administrative resources and focus on cooperation among business units and sharing of resources.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are primarily focused on three markets within the broader marine technology space, Marine Exploration, Marine Survey and Maritime Security. Customers within these market segments include marine survey companies, seismic survey contractors, non-military governmental organizations, research institutes, first responders, domestic and foreign navies, and operators of port facilities and other offshore installations.
 
The discontinued operations of the Leasing Business include all leasing activity, sales of lease pool equipment and certain other equipment sales and services related to those operations. This business had been conducted from our locations in Huntsville, Texas; Calgary, Canada; Bogota, Colombia; and Budapest, Hungary. This included the operations of our subsidiaries, Mitcham Canada, ULC (“MCL”), Mitcham Europe Ltd. (“MEL”), and our branch in Colombia.
 
Our products and equipment are utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world, which are described under “Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing.”
 
Marine Technology Products Business –
 
Seamap designs, manufactures and sells a broad range of products for the oceanographic, hydrographic and marine seismic industries. Seamap’s primary products include the GunLink™ seismic source acquisition and control systems, commonly referred to as “energy source controllers”, and the BuoyLink™ RGPS (“relative global positioning system”) tracking system, and SeaLink marine sensors and solid streamer systems (collectively, the “SeaLink” product line or “towed streamer products”). Applications for these technologies include marine seismic surveys related to energy exploration, as well as other resources, ocean bottom surveys and various research activities. Defense related applications have been a minor part of this business historically; however, we believe our hydrophone and solid streamer technologies are well suited to defense and maritime security applications.
 
Klein primarily designs, manufactures and sells advanced side scan sonar systems for the oceanographic, hydrographic, defense and maritime security industries on a world-wide basis. Klein’s family of sonar products are used in a variety of applications including hydrographic surveys, naval mine counter measure operations, search and recovery operations, ocean bottom profiling and other underwater object detection operations.
 
Seamap and Klein have overlapping customer bases in some cases and it is not uncommon for a marine survey vessel to be equipped with products from both Seamap and Klein. We expect that in the future we will have opportunities to package products from Seamap and Klein in response to requests from customers.
 
    2 

  

The technologies underlying the products of Seamap and Klein are similar, as are the engineering disciplines and challenges. We anticipate significant engineering collaboration between Seamap and Klein and plan to jointly develop new products.
 
The manufacturing processes of Seamap and Klein are also similar. While we expect to maintain separate manufacturing operations, we do believe there will be opportunities for collaboration. Such collaboration might include using common suppliers, outsourcing specific functions between the operations and common support and repair activities.
 
Discontinued Operations –
 
Our lease pool of land seismic equipment consisted of many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition, including various electronic components of land, transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems, geophones and cables, peripheral equipment, survey and other equipment.
 
Historically, we leased our equipment on a short-term basis, generally for two to six months, to seismic contractors who needed equipment for a particular seismic survey. Short-term leasing agreements enabled our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies. A typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys. Our customers may have leased a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew’s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew. Our equipment lease rates varied according to an item’s expected useful life, utilization, acquisition cost and the term of the lease.
 
As activity in the seismic equipment market declined over the past several years, we reduced our lease pool of equipment by limiting purchases of additional equipment and by selling equipment that we deemed to be excess. We have sold the majority of this equipment and are actively pursuing the sale of the remaining lease pool equipment. Proceeds from any such sales will be reinvested and redeployed in our Marine Technology Products business.
 
Seismic Technology
 
Data generated from digital seismic recording systems and peripheral equipment is used in a variety of marine and land applications, including hydrographic surveys, civil engineering operations, mining surveys and in the search for and development of oil and gas reserves. In addition, marine seismic sensors can be used in a number of military and security applications, such as anti-submarine warfare. Users of seismic technology include marine and land seismic contractors, marine survey operators, research institutes and governmental entities.
 
The acoustic sensors, or hydrophones, and streamer systems used in seismic applications can also be utilized in developing passive and active sonar systems. Such technology is widely used in maritime security and defense applications, such as anti-submarine warfare.
 
Side Scan Sonar Technology
 
A side scan sonar (sound navigation and ranging) system is a specialized system used for detecting and identifying objects underwater by transmitting sound energy to the right and left of the host vehicle and processing the return signals (echoes) that have bounced off the seafloor or other objects into two-dimensional, photo like, images of the ocean bottom. Basic side scan sonar systems do not provide depth information nor, do they penetrate the seafloor bottom. However, side scan sonar models are available that incorporate bathymetry elements (the study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors). These systems provide bathymetric (depth) information that is co-registered with side scan data. Sub-seafloor bottom profiling can also be used in concert with side scan sonar technology to look below the seabed into the stratum layers.
 
Users of side scan sonar technology include governmental and military organizations, port and harbor authorities, fire and police departments, offshore oil and gas operators and contractors, universities and scientific organizations, mining companies, marine survey companies and marine salvage operators. Applications that utilize side scan sonar technology include the following:
 

• | preplanned shipping route surveys;
--+-----------------------------------


• | mine counter measures and mine-like object detection;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | environmental assessments;

Business and Operations
 
Marine Technology Products Business –
 
Through our Marine Technology Products business, we develop, manufacture and sell a range of proprietary products for the oceanographic, hydrographic, seismic, defense and maritime security industries. We have developed certain of our technology and have acquired other technology through the purchase of businesses or specific assets from others. We expect to continue to internally develop new technology or enhancements to our existing technology. However, we may also gain access to new technology or products through acquisition, joint venture arrangements or licensing agreements.
 
Seamap’s primary products include: (1) the GunLink seismic source acquisition and control systems, which are designed to provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise monitoring and control of energy sources; (2) the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system, which is used to provide precise positioning of marine seismic energy sources and streamers; (3) Digishot™ energy source controller; (4) Sleeve Gun energy sources and (5) the SeaLink towed seismic streamer system. Seamap’s other products include streamer weight collars, depth transducers, pressure transducers, air control valves and source array systems. In addition to selling complete products, Seamap provides spare and replacement parts related to the products it sells. Seamap also provides certain services related to its products. These services include repair, engineering, training, field service operations and umbilical terminations.
 
We maintain a Seamap facility in the United Kingdom which includes engineering, training, sales and field service operations. Our Seamap facility in Singapore includes engineering, assembly, sales, repair and field service operations. To support our SeaLink product line, we have a production facility in Malaysia that provides manufacturing and repairs of the streamer components of this system, as well as other items. The facility in Malaysia is in relatively close proximity to our Singapore facility.
 
Klein is a supplier of side scan sonar equipment and systems. Products are marketed to governmental and commercial customers through an internal sales organization and a network of distributors and representatives around the world. Sales, engineering, production and administrative operations are performed from Klein’s facility in Salem, New Hampshire.
 
Klein offers an extensive product line of side scan sonar systems and related products. The product line includes multi-beam and single-beam side scan sonar systems with varying levels of capability. These products are utilized in a number of applications including portable search and recovery, shallow and deep-water surveys, naval mine warfare, underwater object detection and bathymetry. These products can be deployed from vessels of varying size, including autonomous underwater vehicles and autonomous surface vehicles. Traditional side scan sonar imaging creates a nadir gap in the center of the image.  This gap in data requires overlapping survey lines which leads to significant additional survey time to achieve 100% coverage.  For the operators of autonomous underwater vehicles (“AUV”), this translates into extended mission duration. Traditional “gap-filler” solutions tend to be expensive or of low image quality.  A cost-effective gap-filler solution has long been sought by the industry. We have developed unique technology, MA-X™, that addresses this need. We believe this technology provides us with a significant competitive advantage over other solutions.
 
In March 2022, we introduced new technology which can provide users of our sonar systems automated target recognition (“ATR”) functionality. We believe our ATR solution is unique in that it has been optimized to operate on our sonar systems, thereby providing superior results.  We believe this new technology will provide competitive advantages and promote the sale of our sonar systems. During fiscal 2021 we entered into an agreement with a major European defense contractor for the joint development and marketing of synthetic aperture sonar (“SAS”) systems. SAS is a form of sonar in which sophisticated post-processing of sonar data is used in ways closely analogous to synthetic aperture radar. In many applications and conditions, SAS can provide superior images and results as compared to traditional side scan sonar. Under the development agreement with our partner, we are in the process of jointly developing SAS sensor systems, initially for deployment on unmanned underwater vehicles. The agreement also anticipates that, depending on the market, this technology will be sold directly by us or through our partner.
 
Components for our products are sourced from a variety of suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. Products are generally assembled, tested and shipped from our facilities in Singapore, Malaysia, Texas and New Hampshire.
 
Key Agreements
 
We have a number of agreements for the distribution or representation of our products. These agreements are generally cancellable upon a notice period of from one to three months.
Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing
 
In fiscal 2022 and 2021, our single largest customer accounted for approximately 23% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Together, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2022. The loss of any one of our largest customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of these customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Due to the nature of our sales, the significance of any one customer can vary significantly from year to year. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”

As of January 31, 2022, our Marine Technology Products business had a backlog of orders amounting to approximately $13.1 million, compared to $14.2 million as of January 31, 2021. We expect the backlog of orders as of January 31, 2022, to be fulfilled during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”).
 
We analyze our backlog, which we define as orders we consider to be firm based on the receipt of a purchase order or other documentation from the customer, to evaluate operations and future revenue potential. As backlog is not a defined accounting term, our computation of backlog may not be comparable with that of our peers. In addition, project cancellations and scope adjustments may occur from time to time. For example, certain contracts are terminable at the discretion of our customers, with or without cause. These types of backlog reductions could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Our backlog for the period beyond the next twelve months may be subject to variation from the prior year as existing contracts are completed, delayed or renewed or new contracts are awarded, delayed or canceled. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings.
 
We participate in both domestic and international trade shows and expositions to inform the appropriate industries of our products and services, and we advertise in major trade journals.

Competition
 
Marine Technology Products –
 
We compete with a number of other manufacturers of marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own. We generally compete for sales of equipment on the basis of (1) technical capability, (2) reliability, (3) price, (4) delivery terms and (5) service.
Discontinued Operations –
 
The major competitors for our Leasing Business included seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms, offer leases with purchase options and offer short term rentals of their products. In addition, some seismic contractors might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time. We faced lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing, but this competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors did not have as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide geographic presence as we did. We compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of (1) price, (2) delivery terms, (3) availability of desired equipment and (4) location of equipment. We believed that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provided a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies.
 
We compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners, including seismic data acquisition contractors, who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own.
 
Suppliers
 
We obtain parts, components and services from a number of suppliers to our manufacturing operation. These suppliers are located in various geographic locations. Certain materials utilized in the construction of our solid streamer products are currently obtained from a sole source. We have not experienced supply disruptions from this source but are exploring various options to expand supply sources.
 
For additional information regarding the risk associated with our suppliers, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
 
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2022, we employed approximately 200 people on a full-time basis, none of whom were represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. For additional information regarding the risks associated with our employees, see Item 1A-”Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
 
The products designed, manufactured and sold by our Marine Technology Products business utilize significant intellectual property that we have developed, purchased or have licensed from others. Our internally developed intellectual property consists of product designs, trade secrets and patent applications. We have acquired certain United States and foreign patents related to energy source controllers, hydrophone and other technologies. We believe these acquired intellectual property rights will allow us to incorporate certain design features and functionality in future versions of our GunLink and Sealink product lines, as well as other products. We believe the pertinent patents to have a valid term through at least 2028. We have pending patent applications related to our MA-X™ technology.
 
For additional information regarding the risks associated with our intellectual property, see Item 1A-”Risk Factors.”

Governmental Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to worker safety and health; the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals and other materials used in our manufacturing processes or otherwise generated from our operations; or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. Compliance with these laws and regulations in the United States at the federal, state and local levels may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; result in capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and other releases; obligate us to use more stringent precautions for disposal of certain wastes; require reporting of the types and quantities of various substances stored, processed, transported, generated, or released in connection with our operations; or obligate us to incur substantial costs to remediate releases of chemicals or materials to the environment. Foreign countries in which we conduct operations may also have analogous controls that regulate our environmental and worker safety and health-related activities, which controls may impose additional, or more stringent requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of restrictions, delays, or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of injunctive relief in affected areas. We may be subject to strict, joint and several liability as well as natural resource damages resulting from spills or releases of chemicals or other regulated materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as “CERCLA” or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws, impose liability, potentially without regard to fault or legality of the activity at the time, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed, transported or arranged for the disposal or transport of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as “RCRA,” regulates the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Materials we use in the ordinary course of our operations, such as paint wastes and waste solvents may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or considered hazardous substances under CERCLA. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by spills or releases that may affect them. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, remediate environmental contamination, and undertake measures to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be significant.
 
Contracts with governmental organizations, including the United States Government, have not been the source of a majority of our revenues in the past. However, we anticipate such sources becoming a more significant portion of our business in the future. Governmental regulations, procurement procedures and budgetary factors could have a material impact on our future results of operations.
 
The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any such new laws and regulations, changes in such existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of such legal requirements, or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Furthermore, the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing or climate-change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon-based fuels or decreasing the performance of oil or natural gas exploration or production activities by energy companies could reduce demand for certain of our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in one of the first acts of his presidency, U.S. President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, a voluntary international agreement with the goal of limiting global climate change to not more than 2 degrees Celsius (or less); preparing, maintaining and publishing national greenhouse gas (“GHG”) reduction targets; and creating a “carbon-neutral” world by 2050. The Biden administration has also set ambitious domestic targets for curbing climate change, such as making the U.S. power sector climate neutral by 2035. New regulations aiming to curb carbon emissions or to establish carbon pricing could be promulgated to implement these goals and initiatives. 
 
We are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign worker safety and health laws and regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and emergency planning and response laws and regulations, such as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, as well as comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations. These laws and regulations obligate us to organize and/or disclose information about certain chemicals and materials used or produced in our operations and to provide this information to employees, state and legal governmental authorities and citizens. Historically, our environmental worker safety and health compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. For additional information regarding the risk associated with environmental matters, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
