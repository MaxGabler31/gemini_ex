Item 1.  Business
OVERVIEW

Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless context requires otherwise, “Helix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in 1979 and in 1983 was re-incorporated in the state of Minnesota. We are an international offshore energy services company that provides specialty services to the offshore energy industry, with a focus on well intervention and robotics operations. We seek to provide services and methodologies that we believe are critical to maximizing production economics. We provide services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions, and in 2017 expanded our operations into Brazil with the commencement of operations of the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels for Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”). Our “life of field” services are segregated into three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. For additional information regarding our strategy and business operations, see sections titled “Our Strategy” and “Our Operations” included elsewhere within Item 1. Business of this Annual Report.

Our principal executive offices are located at 3505 West Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77043; our phone number is 281-618-0400. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “HLX.” Our Chief Executive Officer submitted the annual CEO certification to the NYSE as required under its Listed Company Manual in June 2017.

OUR STRATEGY

Our focus is on our well intervention and robotics businesses. We believe that focusing on these services will deliver favorable long-term financial returns. From time to time, we make strategic investments that expand our service capabilities or add capacity to existing services in our key operating regions. Our well intervention fleet expanded following the delivery of the Siem Helix 2 chartered vessel in February 2017 and is expected to further expand following the completion and delivery of the Q7000, a newbuild semi-submersible vessel, in 2018 or 2019. Chartering newer vessels with additional capabilities, including the Grand Canyon III chartered vessel that went into service for us in May 2017, should enable our robotics business to better serve the needs of our customers. From a longer-term perspective we also expect to benefit from our fixed fee agreement for the Helix Producer I (the “HP I”), a dynamically positioned floating production vessel that processes production from the Phoenix field for the field operator until at least June 1, 2023.

In January 2015, Helix, OneSubsea LLC, OneSubsea B.V., Schlumberger Technology Corporation, Schlumberger B.V. and Schlumberger Oilfield Holdings Ltd. entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement and related agreements for the parties’ strategic alliance to design, develop, manufacture, promote, market and sell on a global basis integrated equipment and services for subsea well intervention. The alliance is expected to leverage the parties’ capabilities to provide a unique, fully integrated offering to clients, combining marine support with well access and control technologies. In April 2015, we and OneSubsea agreed to jointly develop and ordered a 15,000 working p.s.i. intervention riser system (“15K IRS”) for a total cost of approximately $28 million (approximately $14 million for our 50% interest). At December 31, 2017, our total investment in the 15K IRS was $14.9 million inclusive of capitalized interest. The 15K IRS was completed and placed in service in January 2018. In October 2016, we and OneSubsea launched the development of our first Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (“ROAM”) for an estimated cost of approximately $12 million (approximately $6 million for our 50% interest). At December 31, 2017, our total investment in the ROAM was $3.6 million. The ROAM is expected to be available to customers in the first half of 2018.

OUR OPERATIONS

We have three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. We provide a full range of services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions, and expanded our operations into Brazil with the commencement of operations for Petrobras of the Siem Helix 1 in April 2017 and the Siem Helix 2 in December 2017. Our Well Intervention segment includes our vessels and equipment used to perform well intervention services primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Brazil. Our Well Intervention segment also includes intervention riser systems (“IRSs”), some of which we rent out on a stand-alone basis, and subsea intervention lubricators (“SILs”). Our well intervention vessels include the Q4000, the Q5000, the Seawell, the Well Enhancer, and the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 chartered vessels. We also have a semi-submersible well intervention vessel under construction, the Q7000. Our Robotics segment includes remotely operated vehicles (“ROVs”), trenchers and ROVDrills designed to complement offshore construction and well intervention services, and currently operates three ROV support vessels under long-term charter, including the Grand Canyon III that went into service for us in May 2017. Our Production Facilities segment includes the HP I, the Helix Fast Response System (the “HFRS”) and our investment in Independence Hub, LLC (“Independence Hub”). All of our production facilities activities are located in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 12 for financial results related to our business segments.

Our current services include:


• | Production. Well intervention; intervention engineering; production enhancement; inspection, repair and maintenance of production structures, trees, jumpers, risers, pipelines and subsea equipment; and life of field support. 


• | Reclamation. Reclamation and remediation services; well plugging and abandonment services; pipeline abandonment services; and site inspections. 


• | Development. Installation of flowlines, control umbilicals, manifold assemblies and risers; trenching and burial of pipelines; installation and tie-in of riser and manifold assembly; commissioning, testing and inspection; and cable and umbilical lay and connection. We have experienced increased demand for our services from the alternative energy industry. Some of the services that we provide to these alternative energy businesses include subsea power cable installation, trenching and burial, along with seabed coring and preparation for construction of wind turbine foundations.

• | Production facilities. Provision of oil and natural gas processing facilities and services to oil and gas companies operating in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, using our HP I vessel. Currently, the HP I is being utilized to process production from the Phoenix field. 


• | Fast Response System. Provision of the HFRS as a response resource that can be identified in permit applications to federal and state agencies and respond in the event of a well control incident. 

Well Intervention

We engineer, manage and conduct well construction, intervention and abandonment operations in water depths ranging from 200 to 10,000 feet. As major and independent oil and gas companies conduct operations in the deepwater basins of the world, development of these reserves will often require the installation of subsea trees. Historically, drilling rigs were typically necessary for subsea well intervention to troubleshoot or enhance production, shift sleeves, log wells or perform recompletions. Our well intervention vessels serve as work platforms for well intervention services at costs that historically have been less than offshore drilling rigs. Competitive advantages of our vessels are derived from their lower operating costs, together with an ability to mobilize quickly and to maximize operational time by performing a broad range of tasks related to intervention, construction, inspection, repair and maintenance. These services provide a cost advantage in the development and management of subsea reservoirs. Over time, we expect long-term demand for well intervention services to increase due to the growing number of subsea tree installations and the efficiency gains from specialized intervention assets and equipment.

In the Gulf of Mexico, our multi-service semi-submersible vessel, the Q4000, has set a series of well intervention “firsts” in increasingly deeper water without the use of a traditional drilling rig. In 2010, the Q4000 served as a key emergency response vessel in the Macondo well control and containment efforts. The Q4000 also serves an important role in the HFRS that was originally established in 2011. Our Q5000 semi-submersible well intervention vessel commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter of 2015. The vessel went on contracted rates in May 2016 under our five-year contract with BP.

In the North Sea, the Well Enhancer has performed well intervention, abandonment and coil tubing services since it joined our fleet in the North Sea region in 2009. The Seawell has provided well intervention and abandonment services since 1987. The vessel underwent major capital upgrades in 2015 to extend its estimated useful economic life by approximately 15 years. The chartered Skandi Constructor performed well intervention services for us in the North Sea beginning in September 2013 and was returned to its owner in March 2017 upon the expiration of the vessel charter.

In September 2013, we executed a contract with the same shipyard in Singapore that constructed the Q5000 for the construction of a newbuild semi-submersible well intervention vessel, the Q7000, to be built to North Sea standards. Pursuant to the contract and subsequent amendments, including the third amendment that was entered into in November 2017, 20% of the contract price was paid upon the signing of the contract in 2013, 20% was paid in 2016, 20% was paid in December 2017, 20% is to be paid on December 31, 2018, and 20% is to be paid upon the delivery of the vessel, which at our option can be deferred until December 31, 2019.

In February 2014, we entered into agreements with Petrobras to provide well intervention services offshore Brazil, and in connection with the Petrobras agreements, we entered into charter agreements with Siem Offshore AS (“Siem”) for two newbuild monohull vessels, the Siem Helix 1 and the Siem Helix 2. The initial term of the charter agreements with Siem is for seven years from the respective vessel delivery dates with options to extend. The initial term of the agreements with Petrobras is for four years with Petrobras’s options to extend. The Siem Helix 1 was delivered to us and the charter term began on June 14, 2016. The vessel was accepted by Petrobras and commenced operations on April 14, 2017, at which time we agreed with Petrobras to commence operations at reduced day rates. Our day rates have improved as we addressed most of the items identified in the vessel acceptance process. The Siem Helix 2 was delivered to us and the charter term began on February 10, 2017. The vessel was accepted by Petrobras and commenced operations on December 15, 2017 at contracted rates.

Robotics

We have been actively engaged in robotics for over three decades. We operate ROVs, trenchers and ROVDrills designed for offshore construction, maintenance and well intervention services. As global marine construction support operates in deeper waters, the use and scope of ROV services has expanded. Our chartered vessels add value by supporting deployment of our ROVs and trenchers. We provide our customers with vessel availability and schedule flexibility to meet the technological challenges of their subsea activities worldwide. Our 
6

robotics assets include 48 ROVs, five trenching systems and two ROVDrills. Our robotics business unit primarily operates in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, West Africa and Asia Pacific regions. We currently charter vessels on a long-term basis to support our robotics operations and we have historically engaged spot vessels on short-term charter agreements as needed. Vessels currently under long-term charter agreements include the Grand Canyon, the Grand Canyon II and the Grand Canyon III. Our vessel charter for the Deep Cygnus was terminated on February 9, 2018, at which time we returned the vessel to its owner.

Over the last decade there has been an increase in offshore activity associated with the growing alternative (renewable) energy industry. Specifically there has been an increase in services required to support the offshore wind farm industry. As the level of activity for offshore alternative energy projects has increased, so has the need for reliable services and related equipment. Historically, this work was performed with the use of barges and other similar vessels, but these types of services are now being contracted to vessels such as our Grand Canyon and Grand Canyon III chartered vessels that are suitable for harsh weather conditions that can occur offshore, especially in northern Europe where offshore wind farming is currently concentrated. In 2017, revenues derived from offshore renewables contracts accounted for 15% of our global robotics revenues. We believe that over the long term our robotics business unit is positioned to continue the services it provides to a range of clients in the alternative energy business. This is expected to include the use of our chartered vessels, ROVs and trenchers to provide burial services relating to subsea power cable installations on key wind farm developments.

Production Facilities

We own the HP I, a ship-shaped dynamically positioned floating production vessel capable of processing up to 45,000 barrels of oil and 80 million cubic feet (“MMcf”) of natural gas per day. The HP I has been under contract to the Phoenix field operator since February 2013, currently under a fixed fee agreement through at least June 1, 2023.

We own a 20% interest in Independence Hub, which owns the Independence Hub platform located in 8,000 feet of water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

We developed the HFRS in 2011 as a culmination of our experience as a responder in the 2010 Macondo well control and containment efforts. The HFRS centers on two of our vessels, the HP I and the Q4000, both of which played a key role in the Macondo well control and containment efforts and are currently operating in the Gulf of Mexico. Pursuant to an agreement with certain industry participants in exchange for a retainer fee, the HFRS provides these participants with a response resource that can be named in permit applications to federal and state agencies. The HFRS agreements with individual participants also specify the day rates to be charged should the HFRS be deployed in connection with a well control incident. The agreement providing access to the HFRS was amended effective February 1, 2017 to extend the term of the agreement by one year to March 31, 2019 and to reduce the retainer fee.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

We primarily operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions and in 2017 expanded our operations into Brazil with the commencement of operations of the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels for Petrobras. See Note 12 for revenues as well as property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, by geographic areas.
CUSTOMERS

Our customers include major and independent oil and gas producers and suppliers, pipeline transmission companies, alternative (renewable) energy companies and offshore engineering and construction firms. The level of services required by any particular customer depends, in part, on the size of that customer’s capital expenditure budget in a particular year. Consequently, customers that account for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent fiscal years. The percent of consolidated revenues from major customers, those whose total represented 10% or more of our consolidated revenues is as follows: 2017 — BP (19%), Petrobras (13%) and Talos (10%), 2016 — BP (17%) and Shell (11%), and 2015 — Shell (16%) and Talos (11%). We provided services to over 40 customers in 2017.

COMPETITION

The oilfield services industry is highly competitive. While price is a factor, the ability to access specialized vessels, attract and retain skilled personnel, and demonstrate a good safety record is also important. Our principal competitors in the well intervention business include Island Offshore, Wild Well Control and international drilling contractors. Our principal competitors in the robotics business include C-Innovation, LLC, DeepOcean Group, DOF Subsea Group, Fugro N.V. and Oceaneering International, Inc. Our competitors may have significantly more financial, personnel, technological and other resources available to them.
TRAINING, SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

Our corporate vision is based on the belief that all incidents should be preventable. Helix strives to achieve this by focusing on controlling major hazard risks and managing behavior. We have established a corporate culture in which QHSE has equal priority to our other business objectives. Should QHSE be in conflict with business objectives, then QHSE will take priority. Everyone at Helix has the authority and the duty to “STOP WORK” they believe is unsafe.

Our QHSE management systems and training programs were developed by management personnel based on common industry work practices and by employees with on-site experience who understand the risk and physical challenges of the ocean work site. As a result, we believe that our QHSE programs are among the best in the industry. We maintain a company-wide effort to continuously improve our control of QHSE risks and the behavior of our employees.

The process includes the assessment of risk through the use of selected risk analysis tools, control of work through management system procedures, job risk assessment of all routine and non-routine tasks, documentation of all daily observations, collection of data and data treatment to provide the mechanism for understanding our QHSE risks and at-risk behaviors. In addition, we schedule hazard hunts on each vessel and regularly audit QHSE management systems; both are completed with assigned responsibilities and action due dates.

The management systems of our well intervention and robotics business units have been independently assessed and registered compliant to ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems). All of our safety management systems are created in accordance with and conform to OHSAS 18001.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Overview

Many aspects of the offshore marine construction industry are subject to extensive governmental regulations. We are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard (the “Coast Guard”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) as well as state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which we operate, three divisions of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”), the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (the “BSEE”), the Office of Natural Resource Revenue (the “ONRR”), and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”) as well as classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (the “ABS”). We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety for our land-based operations.

In the North Sea, international regulations govern working hours and a specified working environment, as well as standards for diving procedures, equipment and diver health. These North Sea standards are some of the most stringent worldwide. In the absence of any specific regulation, our North Sea operations adhere to standards set by the International Marine Contractors Association and the International Maritime Organization. In addition, we operate in other foreign jurisdictions each with their own laws and regulations to which we are subject.

With respect to North Sea operations, we also note that the U.K.’s 2016 decision to exit from the EU may result in the imposition of new laws, rules or regulations affecting operations inside U.K. territorial waters.

8

Coast Guard

The Coast Guard sets safety standards and is authorized to investigate vessel and diving accidents as well as other marine casualty incidents and to recommend improved safety standards. The Coast Guard is also authorized to inspect vessels at will. We also adhere to manning requirements which are implemented by the Coast Guard on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”). We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain various permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations.
BOEM and BSEE

The development and operation of oil and gas properties located on the OCS of the United States is regulated primarily by the BOEM and BSEE. Among other requirements, the BOEM requires lessees of OCS properties to post bonds or provide other adequate financial assurance in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. As a service company, we are not subject to these regulations, but do depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas industry, and, therefore our business is affected by laws and regulations as well as changing tax laws and policies relating to the oil and gas industry in general.

The Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 resulted in enhanced standards being implemented for companies engaged in the development of offshore oil and gas wells. These standards are determined and implemented by BSEE. The applicable standards now include Notice to Lessees (NTL), NTL 2010-N06 (Environmental NTL), NTL 2010-N10 (Compliance and Evaluation NTL), NTL 2013-N02 (Significant Change to Oil Spill Response Plan Worst Case Scenario), the Final Drilling Safety Rule, and a rule regarding Production Measurement Documents.

In April 2016, BSEE issued the final Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf-Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control Rule (WCR), which updated requirements for equipment and operations for well control activities associated with drilling, completion, workover and decommissioning operations. Specifically, the “Well Control Rule” resulted in reforms that establish the following items: (1) incorporation of the latest industry standards that establish minimum baseline requirements for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers (“BOPs”); (2) additional controls over the maintenance and repair of BOPs; (3) use of dual shear rams in deepwater BOPs; (4) requirement that BOP systems include technology that allows the drill pipe to be centered during shearing operations; (5) more rigorous third-party certification of the shearing capability of BOPs; (6) expanded accumulator capacity and operational capabilities for increased functionality; (7) real-time monitoring capability for deep-water and high-temperature/high-pressure drilling activities; (8) establishment of criteria for the testing and inspection of subsea well containment equipment; (9) increased reporting of BOP failure data to the BSEE and the Original Equipment Manufacturers; (10) expectations of what constitutes a safe drilling margin and allowance for alternative safe drilling margins when justified; (11) requirements for the use of accepted engineering principles and establishment of general performance criteria for drilling and completion equipment; (12) establishment of additional requirements for using ROVs to function certain components on the BOP stack; (13) requirements for adequate centralization of casing during cementing; and (14) making the testing frequency of BOPs used on workover and decommissioning operations the same as drilling operations.

The Well Control Rule further provides guidance for the design and operation of remotely operated tools including the requirement that ROV tooling used on offshore subsea systems be held to the industry standards incorporated in API 17H, First Edition. On December 29, 2017, BSEE proposed to amend the WCR to reduce certain unnecessary regulatory burdens imposed under the existing regulations, while correcting errors and clarifying current requirements. Comments were due on January 29, 2018. WC rule requirements can significantly affect our operations.

The Jones Act (Coastwise Trade Rules)

We are also subject to the Coastwise Merchandise Statute (commonly known as “the Jones Act”), which provides that only vessels built in the U.S., owned 75% by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizen seafarers may transport merchandise between points in the U.S. This statute has been applied to offshore oil and gas work in the U.S. The Jones Act is interpreted in large part by letter rulings of the CBP. The cumulative effect of these letter rulings has been to establish a framework for offshore operators to understand when an operation can be carried out by a foreign flag vessel and when it must be carried out by a coastwise qualified U.S. flag vessel.
9


In January 2017, CBP proposed a modification or revocation of numerous prior letter rulings regarding the interpretation of the Jones Act, which would have significantly changed how foreign flag vessels could operate on the OCS under the Jones Act. While CBP withdrew this proposal in May 2017, CBP, its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, or the U.S. Congress could revisit the issue through a rulemaking, the Customs Bulletin, or legislation. If a policy change occurred along the lines proposed by CBP in January 2017, such a new interpretation of the Jones Act could adversely impact the operations of non-coastwise qualified vessels working in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and could potentially make it more difficult and/or costly to perform our offshore services in the area. Industry would undoubtedly challenge any such action to the extent that it seeks to limit the ability of non-coastwise qualified vessels from performing the operations they are currently permitted to perform, but such regulatory or legislative action could create the same uncertainty in the industry as the January 2017 CBP proposal did.

Other Federal and State Regulatory Agencies

Additional proposals and proceedings before various federal and state regulatory agencies and the courts could affect the oil and gas industry. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.

These regulatory developments and legislative initiatives may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Overview

Our operations are subject to a variety of national (including federal, state and local) and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce these laws that are often complex, costly to comply with, and carry substantial administrative, civil and possibly criminal penalties for compliance failure. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by the government agencies, both state and federal, with authority over environmental regulation.

Under these laws and regulations, we may be liable for remediation or removal costs, damages, civil, criminal, administrative penalties and other costs associated with releases of hazardous materials (including oil) into the environment, and that liability may be imposed on us even if the acts that resulted in the releases were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.

OPA 90

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), imposes a variety of requirements on offshore facility owners or operators, and the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located, as well as owners and operators or bareboat charterers of vessels. Any of these entities or persons can be “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills up to their limits of liability (except if the limits are broken as discussed below). There are few exceptions and defenses to OPA, including if the spill results solely from the act or omission of certain third parties under specified circumstances, an act of God or an act of war. Failure to comply with OPA may result in the assessment of civil, administrative and criminal penalties. In a final rule published on November 19, 2015, the Coast Guard increased liability limits under OPA 90 equal to the greater of $939,800 or $1,100 per gross ton for vessels other than tankers. Liability limits are higher for certain types of facilities and could apply if our operations resulted in Responsible Party status for a spill from such a facility. The liability limits are not applicable, however, (i) if the spill is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) if the spill results from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or (iii) if a party fails to report a spill or fails to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed under OPA.

10

In addition, OPA requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the Coast Guard with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from such vessels. We currently own and operate five vessels over 300 gross tons. We have provided satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility to the Coast Guard for all of our vessels.

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act imposes controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States and imposes potential liability for the costs of remediating releases of petroleum and other substances. The controls and restrictions imposed under the Clean Water Act have become more stringent over time, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. 

The Clean Water Act also establishes the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States. Pursuant to the NPDES program, EPA has issued Vessel General Permits covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations. The current Vessel General Permit (the “2013 VGP”), which became effective on December 19, 2013, applies to commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to “best management practices” to manage the covered discharges that occur normally in the operation of a vessel, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of each deficiency. The 2013 VGP has also implemented more stringent requirements than the prior Vessel General Permit, including numeric technology-based effluent limitations for ballast water discharges. The 2013 VGP expires on December 18, 2018. We expect a new VGP to be proposed this year. Additionally, certain state regulations and the VGP prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the exploration for, and production of, oil and natural gas into certain coastal and offshore waters.

The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharge of oil and other hazardous substances and imposes liability on Responsible Parties for the costs of cleaning up any environmental contamination caused by the release of a hazardous substance and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. Many states have laws that are analogous to the Clean Water Act and also require remediation of releases of petroleum and other hazardous substances in state waters. Our vessels carry diesel fuel for their own use. Offshore facilities and vessels operated by us have facility and vessel response plans to deal with potential spills. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and state statutes enacted to control water pollution.

Clean Air Act

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that greenhouse gasses are an air pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act and thus subject to regulation by the EPA. In October 2009, the EPA published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas sources in the United States on an annual basis, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded its greenhouse reporting rule to include onshore petroleum and natural gas production, offshore petroleum and natural gas production, onshore natural gas processing, natural gas transmission, underground natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas storage, liquefied natural gas import and export, and natural gas distribution facilities. As of 2011, reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis under this expanded rule.

A variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that are focused on restricting the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases have been introduced in the domestic and international regions in which we operate. For example, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and almost one-half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. More stringent regulations under the Clean Air Act or other similar federal or state law could materially impact our business.

11

CERCLA

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) contains provisions requiring the remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons including owners and operators of contaminated sites where the release occurred and those companies that transport, dispose of, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous substances released at the sites. Under CERCLA, those persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. Third parties may also file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances.

We operate in foreign jurisdictions that have various types of governmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of oil or hazardous substances and the protection of the environment. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for remediation of some types of pollution, including the release of oil, hazardous substances and debris from production, refining or industrial facilities, and other assets we own or operate or that are owned or operated by our customers or our subcontractors.

OCSLA

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (“OCSLA”), provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the production of offshore resources of oil and natural gas, including authority to impose safety and environmental protection requirements applicable to lessees and permittees operating in the OCS. Specific design and operational standards may apply to OCS vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions that could curtail operations and cancellation of leases. Because our operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production, if the government were to exercise its authority under OCSLA to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases, such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since August 2012, the agency has implemented policy guidelines (IPD No. 12-07) under which BSEE will issue incidents of non-compliance directly to contractors for serious violations of BSEE regulations. However, on December 18, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the U.S. government’s appeal regarding a BSEE Notification of an INC civil penalty issued against an oilfield contractor. This development brings closure to the long-standing question of whether BSEE has authority to enforce civil and criminal penalties against offshore contractors.
MARPOL

The United States is one of approximately 170 member countries Party to the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), an agency of the United Nations which is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. The IMO has negotiated the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry, to which we are subject. These standards relate to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions.
Greenhouse Gases and Vessel Engine Emissions

Greenhouse gases and marine engine emissions are an area of increasing regulatory action. We may be subject to a variety of regulations from multiple regulatory bodies that are designed to reduce greenhouse gases or other particulate emissions, including restrictions on the types of fuels used on our vessels, restrictions on the types of engines, carbon neutralization or offset measures and/or requirements to collect and report data on emissions and the costs attendant to each of these efforts.

Annex VI of MARPOL, which addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide requires the use of low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. Vessels worldwide are currently required to use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 3.5%, which the IMO decided in October 2016 to reduce to 0.5% beginning in January 2020.

12

In the U.S., the EPA regulates the standards for emissions from vessel engines, both on its own and as a participant in the IMO. Beginning in 2010, the IMO designated the waters off North American as an Emission Control Area, meaning that vessels operating in the United States must use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Directives have been issued designed to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. These can impact both the fuel and the engines that may be used onboard vessels. In addition, U.S. states can (and in the case of California, have) issue rules regulating emissions from vessels operating off their coasts. In 2016, the California Air Resources Board notified the industry that their vessel fuel regulations would not sunset due to the implementation by the IMO of the emissions regulations in the North American Emission Control Area, but would continue in effect (Marine Notice 2016-1).

In addition, foreign nations and state actors may also impose emissions restrictions. The EU has issued regulations (EU Regulation 2015/757) that requires monitoring and reporting of the emissions of vessels exceeding 5,000 gross tons that call at EU ports, with the first reports due in 2019. At present the regulation is for monitoring and reporting only, but it is anticipated that in the future the EU may move from requiring reporting of emissions to regulations aimed at reducing them.

Current Compliance and Potential Material Impact

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We maintain a robust compliance program to ensure that we maintain and update our programs to meet or exceed regulatory requirements in the areas which we operate. We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, changes in environmental laws and regulations, or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and thus there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future. Such environmental liability could substantially reduce our net income and could have a significant impact on our financial ability to carry out our operations.
INSURANCE MATTERS

Our businesses involve a high degree of operational risk. Hazards, such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions, are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and the suspension of operations. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

As discussed below, we maintain insurance policies to cover some of our risk of loss associated with our operations. We maintain the amount of insurance we believe is prudent based on our estimated loss potential. However, not all of our business activities can be insured at the levels we desire because of either limited market availability or unfavorable economics (limited coverage considering the underlying cost).

Our current insurance program is valid until June 30, 2019.

We maintain Hull and Increased Value insurance, which provides coverage for physical damage up to an agreed amount for each vessel. The deductibles are $1.0 million on the Q4000, the Q5000, the HP I and the Well Enhancer, and $500,000 on the Seawell. In addition to the primary deductibles, the vessels are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of $5 million. We also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, which covers liabilities arising from the operation of the vessels, and General Liability insurance, which covers liabilities arising from construction operations. The deductible on both the P&I and General Liability is $100,000 per occurrence. Onshore employees are covered by Workers’ Compensation. Offshore employees and marine crews are covered by a Maritime Employers Liability (“MEL”) insurance policy, which covers Jones Act exposures, and includes a deductible of $100,000 per occurrence plus a $750,000 annual aggregate deductible. In addition to the liability policies described above, we currently carry various layers of Umbrella Liability for total limits of $500 million in excess of primary limits. Our self-insured retention on our medical and health benefits program for employees is $300,000 per participant.

13

We also maintain Operator Extra Expense coverage that provides up to $150 million of coverage per each loss occurrence for a well control issue. Separately, we also maintain $500 million of liability insurance and $150 million of oil pollution insurance. For any given oil spill event we have up to $650 million of insurance coverage.

We customarily have agreements with our customers and vendors in which each contracting party is responsible for its respective personnel. Under these agreements we are indemnified against third party claims related to the injury or death of our customers’ or vendors’ personnel, and vice versa. With respect to well work contracted to us, the customer is generally contractually responsible for pollution emanating from the well. We separately maintain additional coverage for an amount up to $100 million that would cover us under certain circumstances against any such third party claims associated with well control events.

We incur workers’ compensation, MEL and other insurance claims in the normal course of business, which we believe are covered by insurance. We analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate liability of each claim. We have not incurred any significant losses as a result of claims denied by our insurance carriers. Our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur, and litigation arising from such an event may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events, or that such insurance will continue to be available at current levels of cost or coverage, we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,600 employees. Of our total employees, we had approximately 380 non-U.S. employees covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements. We consider our overall relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

Defined below are certain terms helpful to understanding our business that are located through this Annual Report:

BOEM:   The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) is responsible for managing environmentally and economically responsible development of the U.S. offshore resources. Its functions include offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies.

BSEE:   The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) is responsible for safety and environmental oversight of offshore oil and gas operations, including permitting and inspections of offshore oil and gas operations. Its functions include the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting offshore exploration, development and production, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs.

Deepwater:  Water depths exceeding 1,000 feet.

Dynamic Positioning (DP):  Computer directed thruster systems that use satellite based positioning and other positioning technologies to ensure the proper counteraction to wind, current and wave forces enabling a vessel to maintain its position without the use of anchors.

DP2:  Two DP systems on a single vessel providing the redundancy that allows the vessel to maintain position even with the failure of one DP system.

DP3:  Triple-redundant DP control system comprising a triple-redundant controller unit and three identical operator stations. The system has to withstand fire or flood in any one compartment without the system failing. Loss of position should not occur from any single failure, including a completely burnt fire subdivision or flooded watertight compartment.

Intervention Riser System (IRS):  A subsea system that establishes a direct connection from a well intervention vessel, through a rigid riser, to a conventional or horizontal subsea tree in depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The system can be utilized for wireline intervention, production logging, coiled-tubing operations, well stimulation, and full plug and abandonment operations. The system provides the well control in order to safely access the well bore for these activities.

Life of Field Services:  Services performed on offshore facilities, trees and pipelines from the beginning to the end of the economic life of an oil field, including installation, inspection, maintenance, repair, well intervention and abandonment.

QHSE:  Quality, Health, Safety and Environmental programs to protect the environment, safeguard employee health and avoid injuries.

Pound Per Square Inch (p.s.i.):  A unit of measurement for pressure or stress resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch.

Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (ROAM):  An 18¾-inch large bore system that enhances well abandonment capabilities from a well intervention vessel.

Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV):  A robotic vehicle used to complement, support and increase the efficiency of diving and subsea operations and for tasks beyond the capability of manned diving operations.

ROVDrill:  ROV deployed coring system developed to take advantage of existing ROV technology. The coring package, deployed with the ROV system, is capable of taking cores from the seafloor in water depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). Because the ROV system operates from the seafloor there is no need for surface drilling strings and the larger support spreads required for conventional coring.

15

Saturation Diving:  Saturation diving, required for work in water depths between 200 and 1,000 feet, involves divers working from special chambers for extended periods at a pressure equivalent to the pressure at the work site.
