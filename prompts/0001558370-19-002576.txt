     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     Overview
     Harvest Oil & Gas Corp. (“Harvest” or “Successor”), a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company that was formed in 2018 in connection with the reorganization of EV Energy Partners, L.P. (“EVEP,” “Partnership” or “Predecessor”). As used herein, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to (i) Harvest Oil & Gas Corp. after the Effective Date (as defined below) and (ii) EVEP prior to, and including, the Effective Date, in each case, together with their respective consolidated subsidiaries or on an individual basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made.
     We operate one reportable segment engaged in the development and production of oil and natural gas properties. As of December 31, 2018, our oil and natural gas properties are located in the Barnett Shale, the San Juan Basin, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale), Michigan, the Mid–Continent areas in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana, the Permian Basin and the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana. As of December 31, 2018, we had estimated net proved reserves of 711.9 Bcfe and a standardized measure of $436.4 million. Of our total net proved reserves, 98% are proved developed, 67% are natural gas and 53% are operated.
     As a result of the ongoing review of our asset base in order to maximize shareholder value, we have initiated processes to divest certain assets and in the future may look to divest additional assets or all of our remaining assets and use the proceeds to repay bank debt, return capital to shareholders, concentrate in existing positions or venture into new basins. In January and February 2019, we entered into definitive agreements to sell all of our oil and gas properties in the San Juan Basin and certain of our oil and gas properties in the Mid-Continent area. See “—Current Developments—Divestitures” below for additional information.
     Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11
     On March 13, 2018, EVEP and 13 affiliated debtors (collectively, the “Debtors”) entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with certain holders of the Predecessor’s notes, certain lenders under the Predecessor’s reserve-based lending facility, EnerVest, Ltd. (“EnerVest”) and EnerVest Operating, L.L.C. The Restructuring Support Agreement set forth, subject to certain conditions, the commitment of the Debtors and the consenting creditors to support a comprehensive restructuring of the Debtors’ long-term debt (the “Restructuring”). On April 2, 2018 (the “Petition Date”), the Debtors each filed Chapter 11 proceedings under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption In re EV Energy Partners, L.P., et al., Case No. 18-10814. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings, EVEP continued to operate its business and manage its properties under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court as “Debtors-in-Possession.” On May 17, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan.
     On June 4, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), the Debtors satisfied the conditions to effectiveness of the Debtors’ First Modified Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization (as amended, modified and supplemented from time to time, the “Plan”), and the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms. In accordance with the Plan, EVEP’s equity was cancelled, EVEP transferred all of its assets and operations to Harvest, EVEP was dissolved and Harvest became the successor reporting company to EVEP pursuant to Rule 15d-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). See Note 2 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” contained herein for additional information.
     Predecessor and Successor Reporting
     Upon emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, we elected to adopt fresh start accounting effective May 31, 2018 (the “convenience date”) to coincide with the timing of the Company’s normal accounting period close. As a result 

 
  7

 
of the adoption of fresh start accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Company’s consolidated financial statements and certain presentations are separated into two distinct periods, the period before the convenience date (labeled Predecessor) and the period after the convenience date (labeled Successor), to indicate the application of different basis of accounting between the periods presented. Despite the separate presentation, there was continuity of the Company’s operations.
     See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” contained herein for additional information.
     Current Developments
     Our Operating Plan and Strategy
     We focus our efforts on maintaining or minimizing the decline in our reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long–term operations. Our future cash flows from operations are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, production from our wells decreases. We attempt to mitigate or reduce this natural decline through drilling or workover operations. We will maintain our focus on drilling costs as well as the costs necessary to produce our reserves. Our drilling program is dependent on our capital resources and the inventory and economics of drilling prospects and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Our overall operating plan also includes regular reviews of our asset base. As a result of this ongoing review, we have initiated processes to divest of certain assets, and in the future, we may look to divest additional assets or all of our remaining assets in order to maximize shareholder value.
     In order to mitigate the impact of lower prices on our cash flows, we are a party to derivatives, and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on our cash flows. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our future production through December 2020, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices at which we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. We have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our cash flows from operations for those periods. An extended period of depressed commodity prices would alter our development plans, as well as adversely affect our ability to access additional capital in the capital markets. Please refer to Item 7A. “Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” contained herein for more information.
     Divestitures
     In August 2018, we closed the sale of certain oil and gas properties in Central Texas and Karnes County, Texas to Magnolia Oil & Gas Parent LLC and Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (collectively, “Magnolia”) for total consideration of $134.4 million in cash, net of purchase price adjustments, and 4.2 million shares of common stock of Magnolia (NYSE: MGY). Based on the closing price for Magnolia’s common stock on August 31, 2018, total consideration was $192.7 million, net of purchase price adjustments.
     During January 2019, we sold all of our 4.2 million shares of common stock of Magnolia for net proceeds of $51.7 million.
     In addition, in August 2018, we closed the sale of certain oil and gas properties in Central Texas to a third party for total consideration of $3.4 million, net of purchase price adjustments.

The transaction is expected to close in April 2019 and has an effective date of October 1, 2018.
     Also, in February 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain oil and gas properties in the Mid-Continent area to a third party for total consideration of $2.5 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in April 2019 and has an effective date of October 1, 2018.
     See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” contained herein for additional information.
     Our Relationship with EnerVest
     As a result of the Restructuring, EnerVest is no longer a related party to the Company. However, we continue to have a relationship with EnerVest through a services agreement entered into in connection with the Restructuring (the “Services Agreement”) pursuant to which EnerVest operates the majority of our properties and provides other administrative services. See Note 13 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” contained herein for additional information regarding the Services Agreement and the related party status of EnerVest, respectively.

Our Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Data
     Our Reserves
     Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve information presented herein is derived from our reserve reports prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“Cawley Gillespie”) and Wright & Company, Inc. (“Wright”), our independent reserve engineers. All of our proved reserves are located in the United States. The following table presents our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2018:
 | | | Natural Gas | 
 | | Natural Gas | Liquids | 
 | Oil (MMBbls) | (Bcf) | (MMBbls) | Bcfe 
Proved reserves: | | | |

 (1)In February 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our oil and gas properties in the San Juan Basin. See “—Current Developments—Divestitures” below for additional information.
     (2)In January and February 2019, we entered into definitive agreements to sell certain of our oil and gas properties in the Mid-Continent area. These properties included estimated net proved reserves of 9.5 Bcfe, 55% of which is natural gas, as of December 31, 2018. See “—Current Developments—Divestitures” above for additional information.
     Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. PUDs are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. See “Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms.” Proved undeveloped locations conform to the SEC rules defining proved undeveloped locations. We do not have any reserves that would be classified as synthetic oil or synthetic natural gas.
     Our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance and material balance methods. Certain new producing properties with little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production, both of which are believed to provide accurate forecasts. Non–producing reserve estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecast using either or both volumetric or analogy methods. These methods are believed to provide accurate forecasts due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.
     The data in the above tables represents estimates only. Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that are ultimately recovered. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
     Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is the after-tax present value of estimated future net revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, without giving effect to non–property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses and debt service or to depreciation, depletion and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying the year-end statutory tax rates to the pre-tax net cash flows. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. The standardized measure shown should not be construed as the current market value of the reserves. The 10% discount factor, which is required by Financial 

 
  11

 
Accounting Standards Board pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
     At December 31, 2018, our proved reserves had a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of $436.4 million and a present value of future net pre-tax cash flows attributable to estimated net proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum (“PV-10”) of $509.6 million. PV–10, is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre–tax basis and is computed on the same basis as standardized measure but does not include a provision for federal income taxes, Texas gross margin tax or other state taxes. PV–10 is considered a non–GAAP financial measure under the regulations of the SEC. We believe PV–10 to be an important measure for evaluating the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors and creditors may utilize our PV–10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. PV–10, however, is not a substitute for the standardized measure. Our PV–10 measure and standardized measure do not purport to present the fair value of our reserves.
     The table below provides a reconciliation of PV–10 to the standardized measure at December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):
    
Standardized measure | $ | 436.4
Future income taxes, discounted at 10% | | 73.2 
PV-10 | $ | 509.6

      Our Proved Undeveloped Reserves
     We annually review all PUDs to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists. As of December 31, 2017, the Predecessor had no reportable estimated PUDs with respect to any of its properties due to uncertainty regarding the Predecessor’s ability to continue as a going concern and the availability of capital that would be required to develop the PUD reserves.
     At December 31, 2018 (Successor), we had 13.4 Bcfe of PUDs compared with zero PUDs at December 31, 2017 (Predecessor). The following table describes the changes in PUDs during 2018:
    
 | Bcfe 
PUDs as of December 31, 2017 (Predecessor) | — 
Revisions of previous estimates | 66.7 
Sales of minerals in place | (53.3)
PUDs as of December 31, 2018 (Successor) | 13.4 

      The following describes the material changes to our PUDs during 2018:
     Revisions of previous estimates. This change from prior estimates primarily results from our emergence from bankruptcy on June 4, 2018 and the availability of capital required to develop the PUDs within the SEC five-year development limitation on PUDs.
     Sales of minerals in place. In August 2018, we sold oil and natural gas properties in Central Texas and Karnes County, Texas, which included 53.3 Bcfe of PUDs.
     Internal Controls Applicable to our Reserve Estimates
     Our policies and procedures regarding internal controls over the recording of our reserves is structured to objectively and accurately estimate our reserves quantities and present values in compliance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the SEC’s regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations is the responsibility of Terry Wagstaff, our Vice President of Acquisitions and Engineering, who is also our principal engineer. Mr. Wagstaff has over 35 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, with exposure to reserves and reserve related valuations 

 
  12

 
and issues during most of this time, and is a qualified reserves estimator (“QRE”), as defined by the standards of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Further professional qualifications include a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering, extensive internal and external reserve training, asset evaluation and management, and he is a registered professional engineer in the state of Texas. In addition, our principal engineer is an active participant in industry reserve seminars, professional industry groups, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
     Our controls over reserve estimates included retaining Cawley Gillespie and Wright as our independent petroleum engineers. We provided information about our oil and natural gas properties, including production profiles, prices and costs, to Cawley Gillespie and Wright, and they prepared their own estimates of 44% and 56%, respectively, of our reserves attributable to our properties. All of the information regarding reserves in this annual report on Form 10–K is derived from the reports of Cawley Gillespie and Wright, which are included as exhibits to this annual report on Form 10–K.
     The principal engineer at Cawley Gillespie responsible for preparing our reserve estimates is W. Todd Brooker, a President and Principal with Cawley Gillespie. Mr. Brooker is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Texas (license #83462) with over 25 years of experience in petroleum engineering. The principal engineer at Wright responsible for preparing our reserve estimates is D. Randall Wright, the President of Wright. Mr. Wright is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Texas (license #43291) with over 45 years of experience in petroleum engineering.
     We and EnerVest maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers, geoscience professionals and petroleum landmen who work closely with Cawley Gillespie and Wright to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Cawley Gillespie and Wright in their reserves estimation process. Our Vice President of Acquisitions and Engineering reviews and approves the reserve information compiled by our internal staff. Our technical team meets regularly with representatives of Cawley Gillespie and Wright to review properties and discuss the methods and assumptions used by Cawley Gillespie and Wright in their preparation of the year end reserves estimates. Our technical team and Vice President of Acquisitions and Engineering also meet regularly to review the methods and assumptions used by Cawley Gillespie and Wright in their preparation of the year end reserves estimates.
     The audit committee of our board of directors meets with management, including the Vice President of Acquisitions and Engineering, to discuss matters and policies related to our reserves.
     Our Productive Wells
     The following table sets forth information relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of December 31, 2018. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of productive wells in which we have a working interest, regardless of our percentage interest. A net well is not a physical well, but is a concept that reflects the actual total working interest we hold in a given well. We compute the number of net wells we own by totaling the percentage interests we hold in all our gross wells. Operated wells are the wells operated by EnerVest in which we own an interest.
    
 
  13

 

 Our wells may produce both oil and natural gas. We classify a well as an oil well if the net equivalent production of oil was greater than natural gas for the well.

 (2)In January and February 2019, we entered into definitive agreements to sell certain of our oil and gas properties in the Mid-Continent area. These properties included 59,558 gross developed acres (17,500 net developed acres) and 680 gross undeveloped acres (198 net undeveloped acres) as of December 31, 2018. See “—Current Developments—Divestitures” above for additional information.
     (3)There are no spacing requirements on substantially all of the wells on our Monroe Field properties; therefore, one developed acre is assigned to each productive well for which there is no spacing unit assigned.
     Substantially all of our acreage is held by production, which means that as long as our wells on the acreage continue to produce, we will continue to hold the leases. The acreage in which we hold interests that are not held by production are not significant to our overall undeveloped acreage.
     Title to Properties
     As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of the properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, we have obtained title opinions on a significant portion of our properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Our properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.

     Our Drilling Activity
     We intend to concentrate our drilling activity on low risk development drilling opportunities. The number and types of wells we drill will vary depending on the commodity price environment, the amount of funds we have available for drilling, the cost of each well, the size of the fractional working interests we acquire in each well, the estimated recoverable reserves attributable to each well and the accessibility to the well site.
     The following table summarizes our approximate gross and net interest in development wells completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, regardless of when drilling was initiated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value.

      As of December 31, 2018, we were not participating in the drilling of any development wells.
     We did not drill any exploratory wells during the seven months ended December 31, 2018. The Predecessor did not drill any exploratory wells during the five months ended May 31, 2018 or the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.
     Well Operations
     We have entered into operating agreements with EnerVest. Under these operating agreements, EnerVest acts as contract operator of the oil and natural gas wells and related gathering systems and production facilities in which we own an interest, provided that our interest entitles us to control the appointment of the operator of the well, gathering system or production facilities. As contract operator, EnerVest designs and manages the drilling and completion of our wells and manages the day to day operating and maintenance activities for our wells.
     Under these operating agreements, EnerVest has established a joint account for each well in which we have an interest. We are required to pay our working interest share of amounts charged to the joint account. The joint account is charged with all direct expenses incurred in the operation of our wells and related gathering systems and production facilities. The determination of which direct expenses can be charged to the joint account and the manner of charging direct expenses to the joint account for our wells is done in accordance with the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies (“COPAS”) model form of accounting procedure.
     Under the COPAS model form, direct expenses include the costs of third party services performed on our properties and wells, as well as gathering and other equipment used on our properties. In addition, direct expenses include the allocable share of the cost of services performed on our properties and wells by EnerVest employees. The allocation of the cost of EnerVest employees who perform services on our properties is based on time sheets maintained by EnerVest’s employees. Direct expenses charged to the joint account also include an amount determined by EnerVest to be the fair rental value of facilities owned by EnerVest and used in the operation of our properties.

 Principal Customers, Marketing Arrangements and Delivery Commitments
     The market for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, the demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effect of state and federal regulation. The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.
     Our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production is sold to a variety of purchasers. The terms of sale under the majority of existing contracts are short–term, usually one year or less in duration. The prices received for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales are generally tied to monthly or daily indices as quoted in industry publications.
     During 2018, Energy Transfer Operating, L.P. accounted for 15.5% of consolidated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. In 2017, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. and EnLink Midstream Partners, L.P. accounted for 15.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the Predecessor’s consolidated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. In 2016, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., EnLink Midstream Partners, L.P. and Ergon Oil Purchasing, Inc. accounted for 18.5%, 13.4% and 10.4%, respectively, of the Predecessor’s consolidated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. We believe that the loss of a major customer would have a temporary effect on our revenues but that over time, we would be able to replace our major customers.
     Information regarding our delivery commitments is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations” contained herein.
     Competition
     The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil and natural gas companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
     We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program.
     Competition is also strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make further acquisitions.
     Seasonal Nature of Business
     Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations primarily in certain areas of the Appalachian Basin, the San Juan Basin and Michigan. As a result, we generally perform the majority of our drilling in these areas during the summer and autumn months. In addition, the Monroe Field properties in Louisiana are subject to flooding. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the drilling season, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay our operations. Generally demand for natural gas is higher in summer and winter months. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter natural gas requirements during off–peak months. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.

 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters and Regulation
     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the health and safety aspects of our operations and protection of the environment, as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
     require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
     require the installation of pollution control equipment in connection with operations and place other conditions on our operations;
     place restrictions or regulations upon the use or disposal of the material utilized in our operations;
     restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used in connection with drilling, production and transportation activities;
     limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;
     govern gathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas and pipeline and facilities construction;
     require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as site restoration, pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells; and
     require the expenditure of significant amounts in connection with worker health and safety.
     These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal, state and local agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and such changes could result in increased costs for environmental compliance, such as waste handling, permitting, or cleanup for the oil and natural gas industry and could have a significant impact on our operating costs. In general, the oil and natural gas industry has recently been the subject of increased legislation and regulatory attention with respect to environmental matters. In early 2017, the US Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) identified environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for fiscal years 2018 and 2019; however, in 2019, the EPA proposed to transition its focus to significant public health and environmental problems without regard to sector. Even if regulatory burdens temporarily ease, the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental regulation may continue for the long term.
     The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject.
     Solid and Hazardous Waste Handling
     The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous solid waste. Although oil and natural gas waste generally is exempt from regulations as hazardous waste under RCRA, we generate waste as a routine part of our operations that may be subject to RCRA. Although a substantial amount of the waste generated in our operations are regulated as non–hazardous solid waste rather than hazardous waste, there is no guarantee that the EPA or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non–hazardous or exempt waste or categorize some non–hazardous or exempt waste as hazardous in the future. For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the consent decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision 

 
  19

 
of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Non-exempt waste is subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of waste, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
     The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as “hazardous substances.” These classes of persons, or so–called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) include the current and past owners or operators of a site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance found at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes.
     Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of hazardous substance, in the course of our operations, we have generated and will generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substance and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others. Comparable state statutes may not provide a comparable exemption for petroleum. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. In the event contamination is discovered at a site on which we are or have been an owner or operator or to which we sent hazardous substances, we could be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation and natural resources damages.
     We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including offsite locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators, or property contamination, including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future or mitigate existing contamination.
     Clean Water Act
     The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including discharges, spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”). In June 2015, the EPA issued a final rule revising its definition of “waters of the United States.” Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing and the rule was stayed nationwide by the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015. In January 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the definition of the term “waters of the United States” must first be reviewed in federal district courts, which resulted in a withdrawal of the Sixth Circuit stay. The EPA proposed to repeal the rule and, in January 2018, issued a final rule to delay its implementation until 2020 to allow time for the EPA to reconsider the definition. Subsequent litigation in the federal district courts has resulted in patchwork application of the rule in some states (e.g. Pennsylvania), but not others (e.g. Texas, Louisiana). In December 2018, the EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule revising the definition of “waters of the United States” that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular waterbody meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced 

 
  20

 
their intention to challenge the proposed rule. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as require remedial or mitigation measures, for non–compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and cleanup and response costs.
     Safe Drinking Water Act and Hydraulic Fracturing
     Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing activities are typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies. Although the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) expressly excludes regulation of these fracturing activities (except for fracturing activities involving the use of diesel), several federal agencies have recently conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality. These recent developments at the federal level, as well as at state, regional and local levels, could result in regulation of hydraulic fracturing becoming more stringent and costly. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. This report could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and business.
     Legislation was introduced in prior sessions of Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing by eliminating the current exemption in the SDWA, and, further, to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process, but did not pass. Also, some states and local or regional regulatory bodies have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or that require disclosure of chemicals in the fracturing fluids. For example, New York has imposed a ban on hydraulic fracturing. Further, Pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed, and Wyoming and Texas have adopted legislation requiring drilling operators conducting hydraulic fracturing activities in that state to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the fracturing process. States have also considered or adopted other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, the EPA has published guidance on hydraulic fracturing using diesel. The EPA has also published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) published a final rule that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but, in late 2017, the BLM repealed this rule following years of litigation. The rescission of this rule is being challenged by several environmental groups and states in ongoing litigation.
     State and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas wastewater and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission rules allow it to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity.
     If new laws or regulations imposing significant restrictions or conditions on hydraulic fracturing activities are adopted in areas where we conduct business, we could incur substantial compliance costs and such requirements could adversely delay or restrict our ability to conduct fracturing activities on our assets.

 Oil Pollution Act
     The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”) which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages.     Air Emissions
     Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws and local ordinances governing the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. The CAA and analogous state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed requirements including additional permits. Federal and state laws designed to control hazardous (or toxic) air pollutants, might require installation of additional controls. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could bring lawsuits for civil penalties or seek injunctive relief, requiring us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources.
     On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules to subject oil and natural gas production, storage, processing and transmission operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs under the CAA, and to impose new and amended requirements under both programs. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completion of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Since January 1, 2015, operators have been required to capture the natural gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to new hydraulically fractured wells and also existing wells that are refractured. Further, the finalized regulations also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. These rules may require changes to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business.
     The EPA has adopted rules to regulate methane emissions, including, as of June 2016, from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources, and has announced its intention to regulate methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. However, in September 2018, the EPA, under the new administration, did propose amendments to the NSPS Subpart OOOOa standards that would relax the requirements implemented in June 2016. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit aiming to force EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is currently pending. The status of future regulation remains unclear but if adopted could require changes to our operations, including the installation of new emission control equipment. Simultaneously with the methane rules, the EPA adopted new rules governing the aggregating of multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes, a change which could impact the applicability of permitting requirement to our operations and subject certain operations to additional regulatory requirements. We continuously evaluate the effect of these rules on our operations. In late 2016, the BLM adopted a rule governing flaring and venting on public and tribal lands, which could require additional equipment and emissions controls as well as inspection requirements. Similar to the EPA rule, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of its November 2016 rule. This rule has been challenged in court by both California and New Mexico and litigation is ongoing. Additionally, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution under the Congressional Review Act disapproving the rules; however, the Senate action failed. If allowed to stand, these additional regulations on our air emissions are likely to result in increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions on our business.

 National Environmental Policy Act
     Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) which requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Depending on the mitigation strategies recommended in the Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, we could incur added costs, which may be significant. Reviews and decisions under NEPA are also subject to protest or appeal, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or impose additional conditions upon the development of oil and natural gas projects.     Climate Change Legislation
     More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA’s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. Some states, regions and localities have adopted or have considered programs to address GHG emissions. In addition, both houses of Congress previously considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many states have adopted or considered measures to establish GHG emissions reduction levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs; this legislation was not passed. Depending on the regulatory reach of new CAA legislation implementing regulations or new EPA and/or state, regional or local rules restricting the emission of GHGs, we could incur significant costs to control our emissions and comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, the EPA has adopted a mandatory GHG emissions reporting program which imposes reporting and monitoring requirements on various industries, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. Compliance with these requirements has and is anticipated to require us to make investments in monitoring and recordkeeping equipment. We do not believe, however, that our compliance with applicable monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the GHG reporting program will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. We began reporting emissions in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 and continue to report as required on an annual basis.
     The EPA began regulating methane emissions, including from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources. In June 2016, the EPA published the NSPS Subpart OOOOa standards that require new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile compound emissions. In September 2018, under the new administration, the EPA proposed amendments that would relax the requirements of the Subpart OOOOa standards. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is currently pending. Simultaneously with the methane rules for new and modified sources, the EPA adopted new rules governing the aggregating of multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes, a change which could impact the applicability of permitting requirement to our operations and subject certain operations to additional regulatory requirements. We continuously evaluate the effect of these rules on our operations.
     On November 18, 2016, the BLM published a final rule that was intended to reduce waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore Federal and American Indian leases. Unlike the somewhat overlapping EPA regulations, which apply to new, modified and reconstructed sources, the BLM’s 2016 rule was drafted to address existing facilities, including a substantial number of existing wells that are likely to be marginal or low-producing, including leak detection and repair and other requirements regarding methane emissions. Similar to the EPA rule, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of its November 2016 rule. California and New Mexico have challenged the rule in ongoing litigation.

 In December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislative program addressing GHGs, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Moreover, the federal, regional, state and local regulatory initiatives also could adversely affect the marketability of the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce. The impact of such future programs cannot be predicted, but we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors.
     Endangered Species Act
     The Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities that would harm the species or that would adversely affect that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases that have species that are listed and species that could be listed as threatened or endangered under these laws. The US Fish and Wildlife Service designates the species’ protected habitat as part of the effort to protect the species. A protected habitat designation or the mere presence of threatened or endangered species could result in material restrictions to our use of the land and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. It also may adversely impact the value of the affected leases.
     OSHA and Other Laws and Regulation
     To the extent not preempted by other applicable laws, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, where applicable. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right–to–know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes, where applicable, require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable state statute requirements.
     We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2019 or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in the future. However, we cannot assure you that the passage of more stringent laws and regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.

 Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
     The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local and tribal authorities. Rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion, which could increase the regulatory burden and the potential for financial sanctions for noncompliance. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.     Drilling and Production
     Statutes, rules and regulations affecting exploration and production undergo constant review and often are amended, expanded and reinterpreted, making difficult the prediction of future costs or the impact of regulatory compliance attributable to new laws and statutes. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability. Our drilling and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:
     the location of wells;
     the method of drilling, completing and operating wells;
     the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
     the venting or flaring of natural gas;
     the plugging and abandoning of wells;
     notice to surface owners and other third parties; and
     produced water and disposal of waste water, drilling fluids and other liquids and solids utilized or produced in the drilling and extraction process.
     State and federal regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas between owners in a common reservoir or formation, control the amount of oil and natural gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment. Pipelines and natural gas plants operated by other companies that provide midstream services to us are also subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local authorities, which can affect our operations. State laws also regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties and impose bonding requirements in order to drill and operate wells. Some states have taken up consideration of forced pooling. Other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases.
     States generally impose a production, ad valorem or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil and natural gas within their respective jurisdictions. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.
     We do not control the availability of transportation and processing facilities used in the marketing of our production. For example, we may have to shut–in a productive natural gas well because of a lack of available natural gas gathering or transportation facilities.

 If we conduct operations on federal, state or Indian oil and natural gas leases, these operations must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various non–discrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements, and certain of these operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other appropriate permits issued by the BLM, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Bureau of Indian Affairs, tribal or other appropriate federal, state and/or Indian tribal agencies.
     The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (the “Mineral Act”) prohibits direct or indirect ownership of any interest in federal onshore oil and gas leases by a foreign citizen of a country that denies “similar or like privileges” to citizens of the United States. Such restrictions on citizens of a “non-reciprocal” country include ownership or holding or controlling stock in a corporation that holds a federal onshore oil and gas lease. If this restriction is violated, the corporation’s lease can be cancelled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. Although the regulations of the BLM (which administers the Mineral Act) provide for agency designations of non–reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. It is possible that our stockholders may be citizens of foreign countries which at some time in the future might be determined to be non–reciprocal under the Mineral Act.
     Federal Regulation of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids, including Regulation of Transportation
     The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas are subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas. FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of natural gas by pipelines under the Natural Gas Act as well as under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act.
     Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, interstate transportation services must be provided on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. The FERC-regulated tariffs, under which interstate pipelines provide such open-access transportation service, contain strict limits on the means by which a shipper releases its pipeline capacity to another potential shipper, which provisions include FERC’s “shipper-must-have-title” rule. Violations by a shipper (i.e., a pipeline customer) of FERC’s capacity release rules or shipper-must-have-title rule could subject a shipper to substantial penalties from FERC.
     With respect to its regulation of natural gas pipelines under the NGA, FERC has not generally required the applicant for construction of a new interstate natural gas pipeline to produce evidence of the greenhouse gas emissions of the proposed pipeline’s customers. In August 2017, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a decision remanding a natural gas pipeline certificate application to FERC, which required FERC to revise its environmental impact statement for the proposed pipeline to take into account GHG carbon emissions from downstream power plants using natural gas transported by the new pipeline. It is too early to determine the impacts of this Court decision, but it could be significant.
     Sales of our oil and natural gas liquids are also affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The rates, terms, and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and natural gas liquids by pipelines are regulated by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). FERC has implemented a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipelines to fulfill the requirements of Title XVIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 comprised of an indexing system to establish ceilings on interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipeline rates. In addition, FERC issued a declaratory order in November 2017, involving a marketing affiliate of an oil pipeline, which held that certain arrangements between an oil pipeline and its marketing affiliate would violate the ICA’s anti-discrimination provisions. FERC held that providing transportation service to affiliates at what is essentially the variable cost of the movement, while requiring non-affiliated shippers to pay the (higher) filed tariff rate, would violate the ICA. Rehearing has been sought of this FERC order by various pipelines. It is too recent an event to determine the impact this FERC order may have on oil pipelines, their marketing affiliates, and the price of oil and other liquids transported by such pipelines.

 Gathering service, which occurs on pipeline facilities located upstream of FERC-jurisdictional interstate transportation services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Depending on changes in the function performed by particular pipeline facilities, FERC has in the past reclassified certain FERC-jurisdictional transportation facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities and FERC has reclassified certain non-jurisdictional gathering facilities as FERC-jurisdictional transportation facilities. Any such changes could result in an increase to our costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
     The pipelines used to gather and transport natural gas being produced by us are also subject to regulation by the US Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (“NGPSA”), the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, as reauthorized and amended (“Pipeline Safety Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has established a risk–based approach to determine which gathering pipelines are subject to regulation and what safety standards regulated gathering pipelines must meet. In addition, the PHMSA had initially considered regulations regarding, among other things, the designation of additional high consequence areas along pipelines, minimum requirements for leak detection systems, installation of emergency flow restricting devices, and revision of valve spacing requirements. In October 2015, the PHMSA issued proposed new safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, including a requirement that all hazardous liquid pipelines have a system for detecting leaks and that operators establish a timeline for inspections of affected pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters. If such revisions to gathering line regulations and liquids pipelines regulations are enacted by the PHMSA, we could incur significant expenses.
     Transportation of our oil, natural gas liquids and purity components (ethane, propane, butane, iso–butane, and natural gasoline) by rail is also subject to regulation by the DOT’s PHMSA and the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) under the Hazardous Materials Regulations at 49 CFR Parts 171‑180 (“HMR”), including Emergency Orders by the FRA and new regulations being proposed by the PHMSA, arising due to the consequences of train accidents and the increase in the rail transportation of flammable liquids.
     Although natural gas sales prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
     Exports of US Crude Oil Production and Natural Gas Production
     The federal government has recently ended its decades-old prohibition of exports of oil produced in the lower 48 states of the US. The general perception in the industry is that ending the prohibition of exports of oil produced in the US will be positive for producers of US oil. In addition, the US Department of Energy (the “DOE”) authorizes exports of natural gas, including exports of natural gas by pipelines connecting US natural gas production to pipelines in Mexico, which are expected to increase significantly with the changes taking place in the Mexican government’s regulations of the energy sector in Mexico. In addition, the DOE authorizes the export of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) through LNG export facilities, the construction of which are regulated by FERC. In the third quarter of 2016, the first quantities of natural gas produced in the lower 48 states of the US were exported as LNG from the first of several LNG export facilities being developed and constructed in the US Gulf Coast region. While it is too recent an event to determine the impact this change may have on our operations or our sales of natural gas, the perception in the industry is that this will be a positive development for producers of US natural gas.     Hydraulic Fracturing
     Most of our oil and natural gas properties are subject to hydraulic fracturing to economically develop the properties. The hydraulic fracturing process is integral to our drilling and completion costs in these areas and typically represent up to 60% of the total drilling/completion costs per well.
     We diligently review best practices and industry standards, and comply with all regulatory requirements in the protection of these potable water sources. Protective practices include, but are not limited to, setting multiple strings of 

 
  27

 
protection pipe across the potable water sources and cementing these pipes from setting depth to surface, continuously monitoring the hydraulic fracturing process in real time, and disposing of all non–commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources.
     In compliance with laws enacted in various states, we will disclose hydraulic fracturing data to the appropriate chemical registry. These laws generally require disclosure for each chemical ingredient that is subject to the requirements of OSHA regulations, as well as the total volume of water used in the hydraulic fracturing treatment.
     There have not been any material incidents, citations or suits related to our hydraulic fracturing activities involving violations of environmental laws and regulations.
     Other Regulation
     In addition to the regulation of oil and natural gas pipeline transportation rates, the oil and natural gas industry generally is subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect upon our stockholders.     Insurance
     In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We currently have insurance policies that include coverage for control of well, general liability (includes sudden and accidental pollution), physical damage to our oil and gas natural properties, auto liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability, among other things.
     Currently, we have general liability insurance coverage up to $1.0 million per occurrence, which includes sudden and accidental environmental liability coverage for the effects of pollution on third parties arising from our operations. Our insurance policies contain maximum policy limits and in most cases, deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. These insurance policies are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations. In addition, we maintain $100.0 million in excess liability coverage, which is in addition to and triggered if the general liability per occurrence limit is reached.
     We do not currently have any insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. However, we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover third party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.
     We re–evaluate the purchase of insurance, coverage limits and deductibles annually. Future insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to self–insure or maintain only catastrophic coverage for certain risks in the future.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we have five full–time employees, none of which are field personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
