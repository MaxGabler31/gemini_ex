Our Business



Our subsidiary, Yuxinqi, was organized in February 2018. To date, Yuxinqi has devoted its efforts to the marketing and distribution of selenium-enriched agricultural products, primarily paddy rice. Going forward, Yuxinqi intends to continue its focus on the marketing and sale of selenium-enriched products, while enlarging its offerings to include a variety of crop foods as well as processed foods.



The purpose of Tianci Wanguan is to promote the use of blockchain technology in sales, specifically the development of tracing systems for agricultural products, the development of a blockchain-based shopping mall for agricultural products, and related improvements to the agricultural industry. Tianci Wanguan was organized in November 2020 based on the Cooperation Agreement with Unbounded IOT Block Chain Limited (“Unbounded”). Tianci Wanguan’s focus is on providing software development for other customers.



Software Development



In connection with the growing use of blockchain technology in sales, specifically the development of tracing systems for agricultural products, Tianci Wanguan is developing a blockchain-based shopping mall for agricultural products, and related technology for the agricultural industry. In addition, Tianci Wanguan will provide software development to other customers. At this stage, Tianci Wanguan provides software development services to customers through third-party software development companies.



Selenium-Enriched Products



Selenium is one of the “essential” nutrients for humans, meaning that our bodies cannot produce it, and so we have to get it from our diet. Selenium deficiency can cause health problems including Keshan’s disease, a form of cardiomyopathy. The World Health Organization has found that between 50 and 250 micrograms of selenium constitute a healthy daily intake.



Scientists now know selenium is necessary in the body’s production of selenoproteins, a family of proteins that contain selenium in the form of an amino acid. So far, 25 different selenoproteins in the body have been isolated, but only half of their functions have been identified. Selenium is one of several nutrients known to have antioxidant properties, meaning selenium plays a part in chemical reactions that stop free radicals from damaging cells and DNA. Human and animal research has found selenoproteins are involved in embryo development, thyroid hormone metabolism, antioxidant defense, sperm production, muscle function and the immune system’s response to vaccinations. Antioxidant supplements, including selenium, are often touted to help prevent heart disease, cancer and vision loss.



According to the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association, selenium is purported to help people with asthma, and reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Selenium levels drop with age, so some have claimed selenium can slow the aging process, cognitive decline and dementia. Low selenium levels are also implicated in depression, male infertility, weak immune systems and thyroid problems.



Plants grown in soil containing selenium convert it into a form that is usable to humans and animals. Soil around the world varies in its selenium concentration. The higher the concentration of selenium in soil, the higher the concentration of selenium is in crops. Soil in Nebraska, South and North Dakota, for example, is especially rich in selenium, and people living in these areas typically have the highest dietary intake of selenium in the United States. On the other hand, seventy-two percent (72%) of the land in China is selenium-poor.



Because rice is a staple food in China, selenium-enriched rice obtained by bioenrichment to increase the selenium content of rice was determined to be a good selenium source for the population in selenium-deficient regions.



All our products come from the Sanjiang Plain. The Sanjiang Plain is noteworthy for, among other things, the relatively high content of selenium in its soil. By focusing on the marketing and distribution of selenium-enhanced rice, the Company hopes to develop a sustainable position in the Chinese rice market.

Competition



Currently, the distribution of selenium-enriched agricultural products in China is the province of small and medium-sized enterprises, with no dominant participant in the market. The diversity of the market is primarily a function of the relatively brief period that the inclusion of selenium-enriched food stuffs in the Chinese diet has been popular. As the practice becomes more well-established, the emergence of market leaders will be likely.



We are a small company. However, with our recent focus on distribution of selenium-enriched products, we are entering a growing market. We believe that we will be able to compete effectively in this market because we have the advantage of product specificity, which should enable our brand to become identified as a source for selenium-enriched products.



Suppliers



Over the years of operations, we have developed a solid and reliable image and reputation with suppliers. We have established supplier relationships with several local companies.



On April 24, 2020 the subsidiary of Heilongjiang Tianci Liangtian Agricultural Technology Development Co., Ltd entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement providing for the transfer to Lou Zhengui of Tianci’s 51% interest in the equity of Baoqing County Lvxin Paddy Rice Plant Specialized Cooperative. The Agreement transferred the equity to Lou Zhengui as of April 30, 2020. The contract also provides that Lvxin will continue to sell paddy rice to Yixinqi, and the Company has the right of priority under an agreed upon price.



Marketing



We believe that the importance of selenium to human health and the fact of selenium deficiency in large parts of China create a vast market potential for development. Selenium has been studied extensively in China. These efforts have resulted in confirming that selenium is an important element for human health and that there are areas within China that are significantly deficient in the soil and water. In the past decade, Chinese government policy has helped to enhance the importance of selenium and the potential of the selenium market.



The Company offers value-added products, both products based on rice and products based on other food stuffs, such as organic red beans and millet.



Insurance



We do not maintain fire, theft, product liability or other insurance of any kind. We bear the economic risk with respect to loss of or damage or destruction to our property and to the interruption of our business as well as liability to third parties for damage or destruction to them or their property that may be caused by our personnel or products.
