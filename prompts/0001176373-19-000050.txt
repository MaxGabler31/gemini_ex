Item 1.                    Business.
General 

TIER REIT, Inc. is a publicly traded (NYSE: TIER), self-managed, Dallas-based real estate investment trust focused on owning quality, well-managed commercial office properties in dynamic markets throughout the U.S. As used herein, “TIER REIT,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to TIER REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. TIER REIT was incorporated in June 2002 as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be treated, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes.

As of December 31, 2018, we owned interests in 19 operating office properties, and two development properties located in five markets throughout the United States.  Our corporate offices are located at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75225, and our telephone number is (972) 483-2400.    
Substantially all of our business is conducted through Tier Operating Partnership LP (“Tier OP”), a Texas limited partnership.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tier GP, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the sole general partner of Tier OP.  Our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tier Business Trust, a Maryland business trust, and Tier Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, are limited partners that together with Tier GP, Inc. own all of Tier OP.
Business Strategy
Our strategy is straightforward. Our vision is to be the premier owner and operator of best-in-class office properties in select submarkets within high-growth metropolitan areas that offer a walkable experience to various amenities. We focus on vibrant cities with local GDP and population growth above the national average and amenity-rich submarkets (“TIER1 submarkets”) that appeal to dynamic corporate users and highly educated, in-demand employees. Our mission is to provide unparalleled, TIER ONE Property Services to our tenants and outsized total return through stock price appreciation and dividend growth to our stockholders, although there can be no assurance of any such appreciation or growth.
Our investment efforts are concentrated on our seven target growth markets of Austin, Dallas, Houston, Charlotte, Nashville, Atlanta, and Denver.
2019 Key Objectives
Looking forward, we intend to grow in a prudent manner that reinforces our fundamental strategy of owning and operating best-in-class office properties within TIER1 submarkets in our seven target growth markets. Provided accommodative market conditions persist, we expect development to comprise a significant portion of our investment activity over the next several years. 

As we move into 2019, our business strategy for the upcoming year includes the following four objectives: (1) generate proceeds from planned dispositions; (2) invest in strategic acquisitions; (3) replenish our pre-development pipeline; and (4) commence construction of additional development projects. There can be no assurance regarding our achievement of any of our objectives.
Generate proceeds from planned dispositions
We expect to generate proceeds from planned dispositions as we determine that capital can be more efficiently allocated to create additional value through our build-to-core development program. 
Invest in strategic acquisitions
We continue to target strategic acquisitions, which would allow us to further enhance our portfolio, increase our influence and concentration within TIER1 submarkets, and begin to rebalance our portfolio across our target growth markets. 

Replenish our pre-development pipeline
We will seek to add new projects to our pre-development pipeline by purchasing or controlling new development sites through acquisitions, options, or joint ventures. Controlling key land parcels will provide additional development opportunities as we begin to rebalance our portfolio across our target growth markets.

Commence construction of additional development projects
Development is an important component of our strategy, and provided accommodative market conditions persist, we will continue the prudent execution of our build-to-core development program. With appropriate risk mitigation, the development of additional properties could increase our real estate holdings and deliver cash flow growth as we begin to rebalance our portfolio across our target growth markets. 
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for our properties.  The competition for creditworthy tenants is intense, and we have been required to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, and provide other inducements at a high level.  Without these inducements, we may not be able to continue to lease vacant space timely, or at all, which would adversely impact our results of operations.  We also compete with sellers of similar properties when we sell properties, which may result in our receiving lower proceeds from the sale, or which may result in our not being able to sell such properties due to the lack of an acceptable investment return.  Further, we may compete with other buyers and developers who are interested in properties we may acquire or develop. Some of our competitors, including larger REITs, have greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk. They also may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. These factors may result in an increase in the amount that we would need to pay for such properties or may result in us ultimately not being able to acquire or develop such properties. 
Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our properties and operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.  We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our properties.
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.  However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on our properties.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 92 employees. 
Available Information
We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, in each case including exhibits, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Copies of our filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.tierreit.com or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  Access to these filings is free of charge.  We are not incorporating any information from our website into this Form 10-K. 
SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
        This summary supplements and updates the discussion contained under the caption “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in (i) the prospectus within our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 24, 2016 (the “Prospectus”), (ii) the prospectus supplement that supplements the Prospectus filed with the SEC on May 10, 2017 (the “May 2017 Prospectus Supplement”), and (iii) the prospectus supplement that supplements the Prospectus filed with the SEC on November 5, 2018 (the “November 2018 Prospectus Supplement”), and should be read in conjunction therewith and is subject to qualifications set forth therein.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJA”), was signed into law. The provisions of the TCJA generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Significant provisions of the TCJA that investors should be aware of include provisions that:
 5


• | lower the corporate income tax rate to 21% and lower Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) withholding on certain capital gain dividends to 21%;


• | provide noncorporate taxpayers with a deduction of up to 20% of certain income earned through partnerships and REITs for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026;


• | apply certain new limitations on net operating losses, which limitations may affect net operating losses generated by us or our taxable REIT subsidiaries;


• | expand the ability of businesses to deduct the cost of certain property investments in the year in which the property is purchased;


• | impose new accounting rules that generally require us to recognize income items for federal income tax purposes no later than when we take the item into account for financial statement purposes, which may accelerate our recognition of certain income items;


• | require a U.S. tax-exempt stockholder that is subject to tax on its unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) to separately compute its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI; and


• | generally lower tax rates for individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026, while limiting deductions such as miscellaneous itemized deductions and state and local tax deductions.


In addition, the TCJA limits the deduction for net interest expense incurred by a business to 30% of the “adjusted taxable income” of the taxpayer. However, the limitation on the interest expense deduction does not apply to electing real property trades or businesses, such as any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. Making the election to be treated as a real property trade or business requires the electing real property trade or business to depreciate non-residential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property over a longer period using the alternative depreciation system. We generally will decide whether to make any available election to treat as a real property trade or business any direct or indirect investment made through an entity that we control.

Stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the impact that the TCJA and other legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on their investment in our stock.
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018
            On March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (the “CAA”) was enacted, which amended various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and implicates certain tax-related disclosures contained in the Prospectus, the May 2017 Prospectus Supplement, and the November 2018 Prospectus Supplement. As a result, the discussion on pages 44 to 45 of the Prospectus, the May 2017 Prospectus Supplement, and the November 2018 Prospectus Supplement in the third and fourth paragraphs under “Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Dispositions of Stock” is replaced with the following paragraphs:
            To the extent our stock is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a “qualified shareholder,” it will not be treated as a United States Real Property Interest (“USRPI”). Further, to the extent such treatment applies, any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a USRPI. For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a Non-U.S. Holder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” (within the meaning of section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors,” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder's stock (where “applicable percentage” generally means the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying 
 6

certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of USRPIs. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an “applicable investor” is a person who holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules.

For FIRPTA purposes, a “qualified foreign pension fund” shall not be treated as a Non-U.S. Holder, and any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund shall be treated as such a fund. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees by either (A) a foreign country as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers, or (B) one or more employers in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise made available, to relevant local tax authorities, and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. To benefit from these rules, an investor will be required to provide an appropriate certification that it is not a foreign person for purposes of FIRPTA by reason of being a qualified foreign pension fund or an entity wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund.
         The CAA also amended numerous Code provisions relating to the new rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, to provide that a broader range of partnership-related items may be adjusted on audit or in other tax proceedings.

Finally, the CAA clarified that, for purposes of determining whether a REIT is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” under FIRPTA, the presumption that generally a person holding less than 5% of a REIT's class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States for five years has been, and will be, treated as a U.S. person applies for testing periods ending on or after December 18, 2015 (e.g., if a testing period ended on June 1, 2018, then the presumption applies for the entire five-year period starting on June 1, 2013).
FACTA Withholding
On December 13, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations to eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the Prospectus, the May 2017 Prospectus Supplement, and the November 2018 Prospectus Supplement. While these regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions). As a result, the discussion under “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - FATCA Withholding on Certain Foreign Accounts and Entities” on page 45 of the Prospectus, the May 2017 Prospectus Supplement, and the November 2018 Prospectus Supplement is replaced with the following:
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, imposes withholding taxes on dividends made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other non-U.S. entities unless (i) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or (ii) the foreign non-financial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner. If the payee is a foreign financial institution, it must enter into an agreement with the United States Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements. Investors in jurisdictions that have entered into “intergovernmental agreements” may, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, be required to report such information to their home jurisdictions. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding this legislation.
