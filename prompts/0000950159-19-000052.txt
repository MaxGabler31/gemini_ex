Industry Overview – Field Service Management
 
Field Service Management is generally defined as a technician performing repair, installation, or maintenance activities at a customer site. It involves the manual or automated creation and management of incoming service requests, scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, coordinating parts planning, delivery and usage, managing contracts, meeting service level agreements based upon problem severity and impact, and the repair, refurbishment and retirement process for assets. This definition is increasingly expanding to include remote maintenance and predictive maintenance performed by both a technician or intelligent technology (if such activities fall within a standard service contract). Field service organizations vary greatly in size, industries and supported technologies. Although every industry relies on field service to some degree, for certain industries, field service is critical. Equipment, ranging from computers and peripherals to building systems, office equipment and medical equipment depends on field service. Sometimes this equipment is the lifeblood of a customer or potential customer, and any downtime or service interruption can significantly impair operations or even endanger human life and safety.
 
Today's service-driven enterprises must plan and manage complex service delivery on a global scale. They must be sensitive to an ever more demanding customer and be effective at using new business processes to service an increasingly more complex and connected set of intelligent assets. The benefits of implementing service management solutions are applicable in virtually every service organization, regardless of type, size, or geography served.

Current Product Offerings
 
Astea Alliance Enterprise
 


Astea Alliance Enterprise is a service management offering that includes both software applications and services. The software product consists of a series of applications. The offering has been developed as a global solution for large, complex, service-driven organizations who often require multi-lingual and multi-currency capabilities in both the cloud and on-premises.
 
Alliance Enterprise has been designed to address the complete service lifecycle, from lead generation and project quotation to service and billing through asset retirement. It integrates and optimizes critical business processes for Campaigns, Call Center, Depot Repair, Field Service, Logistics, Projects and Sales and Order Processing applications. Astea extends its application suite with mobile workforce management, dynamic scheduling optimization, third party vendor and customer self-service portals, and business intelligence. In order to ensure customer satisfaction and quick return on investment, Astea also offers infrastructure tools and services.
 
In September of 2018, Astea released Alliance Enterprise (Version 15). We believe that Alliance Enterprise introduces to the field service industry an entirely new perspective on how an enterprise-grade technology can unify the increasingly complex ecosystem in which service-driven companies must operate. Alliance Enterprise is not just a new version of one of the most capable field service applications in the industry. It is expected to be the transition of our technology into a platform that gives customers the power to streamline workflows to create differentiating customer experiences, integrate freely into any other environment, seamlessly and consistently interact with customers and stakeholders via nearly any medium, and do so using a new toolset that does not require technical capabilities. It is designed to give organizations the ability to maximize the value of any workers—employees, third parties and contingent workers—during any type of service activity throughout the entire lifecycle. The platform also automatically updates end customers on the status of their service activities and helps management understand organizational performance out-of-the box.

The market’s response to Alliance Enterprise includes a prestigious award from Frost & Sullivan, a well-recognized industry focused firm, which granted us the 2018 Company of the Year for Mobile Field Service award. Based on its analysis of the field service management software industry, Frost & Sullivan selected Astea for its comprehensive and user-oriented mobile field service application portfolio, its ability to meet the evolving needs of field service organizations and the Company’s ability to incorporate emerging technologies into its product offerings.
 FROST & SULLIVAN

A summary of features released with the updated Alliance enterprise Platform V.15 are highlighted below:
 
Powerful Workflow and Integration Capabilities that Enable Agility
 Alliance Enterprise puts powerful capabilities into the hands of non-technical users via a new process flow engine that offers graphical, drag-and-drop functionality to modify application workflows. This new tool can be harnessed by any user to build flexible, agile business processes that address a wide variety of needs such as integrations, multi-channel communication automation and service escalations. These custom workflows allow organizations to create a unique combination of processes that reflect the nuanced way leaders think about serving their customers, balancing costs versus service-level commitments, differentiating their customers’ experience and managing profitability.
Smart Scheduling that Efficiently Connects All the Right People and Parts
 Long considered one of the most mathematically intelligent scheduling optimization engines in the field service industry, Alliance Enterprise enhances this scheduling capability by integrating with FedEx® and UPS® to coordinate parts delivery dates with technician arrival dates. Additionally, Alliance’s scheduling module creates schedules that incorporate the real-world situations our customer’s technicians and their customers encounter daily. It integrates with Microsoft Outlook® to consider technicians’ personal time off when creating schedules, and it also allows end customers to schedule appointments via the Alliance customer self-service mobile application or web portal.
Sleek, Web-Inspired User Interface Designed for Configurability and Usability
 Alliance Enterprise sports a new clean look and feel that is highly configurable, enabling users to create a streamlined user experience, focusing their attention on only the information they need to do their job. Improved user satisfaction can drive better technology adoption and engagement, and ultimately a better customer experience.

The Alliance Enterprise software version release also included several new and enhanced native mobile applications. We believe that the service industry will soon be at a point where every worker can do their job and be fully mobile at the same time. Our Alliance Manager Edge mobile app proved that field service managers can perform their complex job while being fully mobile. The same is true of our Customer Edge app that gives end-customers complete control over their service experience from anywhere. Now, that same mission of making all field service stakeholders mobile has been achieved for the warehouse with the launch of Warehouse Edge.
 
The new and enhanced native mobile applications in our Alliance Enterprise platform include:
 
Enhanced Customer Self-Service Management Capabilities - Including New Customer Self-Service App
 The customer-centric design philosophy of Alliance Enterprise empowers service organizations to meet their clients’ increasing demands for mobile, real-time participation in the service delivery process.
 With Alliance Enterprise, service companies can deliver a full customer self-service management capability that gives their clients the transparency and control they want. Through the Alliance customer portal called Alliance Connect and mobile app called Alliance Customer Edge, customers have on-demand access to a 360-degree view of their service relationship, allowing them to address their service needs quickly and accurately. This heightened level of smart, instant self-service is convenient, mobile, and conforms to how customers want to interact with their service provider.
Enhanced Warehouse Management Capabilities – Including New Mobile App for Warehouse Workers
 
Alliance Warehouse Edge™ enables warehouse workers to perform all their daily activities on a mobile device.  This latest expansion of its Alliance Enterprise™ field service management platform adds full back office warehouse management functionality along with a new native mobile application for warehouse floor workers. Warehouse Edge expands upon the logistic supply chain capabilities within Alliance Enterprise to provide real-time visibility into parts availability, parts usage, and the purchasing and replenishment process from any of the platform’s native mobile applications or browser-based user interfaces. Astea customers can now realize even greater efficiency by allowing their warehouse and logistics supply chain to utilize the same platform without the need for additional integration.
New Mobile Application for Field Service Managers and Supervisors
 
Our newest native mobile application, Alliance Manager Edge, enables managers, supervisors and crew chiefs to perform all their daily duties while they are on the road, in their service truck, or at a job site. In the app, managers can redirect workloads and assign new service orders with drag-and-drop functionality; review and approve timesheets, field quotes and purchase requisitions; and view vital, real-time information on their service team’s performance such as SLA Hit Rates and Cost per Call. Service personnel are mobile, and we believe service management should be as well.

Astea Alliance Core Applications
 
The Alliance Contact Center application supports call centers, information desks, service hotlines, inside sales and telemarketing activities. Integrated multi-channel inbound/outbound capabilities enable customer service representatives to serve prospects and customers in their media of choice, including phone, fax, e-mail or Internet. Integrated customer self-service portals with automated e-mail response, automated call escalation and interface to Computer Telephony Integration systems help streamline customer interaction processes. Work scheduling and demand balancing optimize staff utilization. Employee portals with access to comprehensive real-time customer data and decision support tools including intelligent knowledge management and scripting for problem resolution, drive higher staff productivity. The objectives of Astea’s Alliance Contact Center software are to reduce overhead through improved first-call resolution rates and shorter service-call handling times, as well as more efficient customer service and higher levels of customer satisfaction. A knowledge engine enhances the diagnostic tools available to contact center agents. This knowledge engine is also available in other areas of the solution suite such as Depot Repair and Field Service.
Alliance Depot Repair
 
Alliance Depot Repair automates the tracking of assets through equipment calibration and repair chains, including merchandise ownership, location, repair status and warranty coverage. Objectives are to gain real-time visibility of all repair chain activities, ensure compliance with warranty and contractual agreements, respond to customer inquiries with up-to-the-minute repair status, collect and analyze repair statistics for product design improvement, and reduce overhead such as inventory carrying costs. Applications support in-house, subcontractor and vendor calibration and repair; customer and vendor exchanges and advance exchanges; equipment on loan; change of ownership; merchandise shipments, cross shipments and pickups; consolidated repair orders; and, storage and refurbishment programs. Integration with other Astea Alliance modules allows repair orders and repair status queries to be initiated from customer contact centers, field service, field sales and warehouses as well as the repair depot.
Alliance Field Service
 
The Alliance Field Service core application delivers a set of automated capabilities intended to streamline and improve management of field service activities. By automating workflow, field service representatives should be able to efficiently complete and document assignments, manage vehicle assets, capture expenses and generate revenue through add-on sales during a customer contact. Applications alert dispatchers to contractual minimum response times and expedite coordination of field force skills matching, scheduling, dispatch and repair parts logistics. The use of the Dynamic Scheduling Engine automates much of this process. The software supports all field service categories including equipment project installations, break/fix activities, planned maintenance and predictive maintenance. Applications can be integrated with equipment diagnostic systems for fully automated solutions that initiate and prioritize service requests and dispatch assignments to field employees’ smartphones, laptops or tablets without human intervention, or that facilitate remote maintenance activities.
  
 8
 
The Alliance Enterprise Version release delivers significant enhancements to the Field Service core application’s Dispatch Console, enabling organizations to optimize schedules across all workers, including employees, third party and contingent workers. This allows organization to control and reduce costs and meet customers’ increasing demands for tighter appointment windows using a wider range of workers. In addition to optimizing schedules across all workforces, the Dispatch Console now offers “just-in-time service” which coordinates the schedule of each technician with the parts delivery date.
 
Alliance Logistics
 
The Alliance Logistics core application is divided into three functional portals. These are Supply Chain, Inventory Management and Reverse Supply Chain, reflecting the diversity of needs in this area. Seamlessly integrated with sales and service applications, Alliance Logistics enables service organizations to control inventory costs, manage assets and implement proactive service management strategies. Automated calculation of stock profiles based on usage eliminates overstocking and dramatically reduces costs associated with storing, depreciating, and insuring inventory. The application supports parts and tools management for effective field service delivery and Service Level Agreements compliance. We believe that improved cost management improves cash flow by streamlining and shortening the cycles from inventory to usage to billing and collection. Lower logistics costs create opportunities to recognize higher margins on products and services. Key areas to apply Alliance Logistics include asset management, field service parts/tools management, demand fulfillment and sales fulfillment.
Alliance Order Processing
 
The Alliance Order Processing module provides straightforward functionality for the management of quotations and order fulfillment. Quotations can be created for the sale of products and the provision of field services. Integration with the approvals process and the Logistics and Field Service modules ensures efficient management control and sustainable promises for delivery. This application is ideally suited to the sale of “consumable products” in association with the provision of equipment-based services, but can be equally applied to the supply of finished products resulting from up-sell and cross-sell opportunities.
Alliance Professional Services
 
Alliance Professional Services supports management of knowledge workers, such as those deployed by professional services organizations and internal service departments of large organizations. Functionality focuses on planning, deploying and invoicing service engagements that can extend for days, weeks, months and years. Applications are expected to improve resource planning and allocation, workflow management, consultant time and expense reporting, subcontractor and vendor invoice processing, customer billing and visibility of service engagements. Integration with other Astea Alliance modules delivers an end-to-end solution to market, sell, manage and bill professional services. Capabilities to share sales, service, project, and post-project field service data across the enterprise, generally enables professional services organizations to operate with less overhead, improved cash flow, higher profitability, and more competitive bidding.
Alliance Sales
 
Alliance Sales consolidates and streamlines the sales processes of an enterprise, from quote generation through order processing, at all points of customer contact including field sales, inside sales, contact center sales and field service sales. Lead-to-close sales process capabilities include integration with customer support and field service applications, leveraging all enterprise knowledge pools with the goal to increase sales opportunities, margins and close rates. Consolidated views of sales and service data also provide a clearer understanding of enterprise operations to drive strategic business decisions. Sales force automation application automates business rules and practices such as enterprise-defined sales methodologies, sales pipeline management, territory management, contact and opportunity management, forecasting, collaborative team selling and literature fulfillment. Other Alliance applications, such as our mobility solutions, prompt customer support and service staff to up-sell and cross-sell during contact with customers.
Alliance Dynamic Scheduling Engine (“Alliance DSE”)
 
Alliance DSE uses the latest technology for a new era of service management. It is a real-time scheduling solution designed to optimize and balance the tradeoffs between service cost and level of service, in accordance with management’s philosophy. It addresses the specific challenges of field service scheduling, while simultaneously calculating ways to increase efficiency, accuracy and profitability with the goal to help users sustain a competitive advantage in today’s customer experience-oriented market place. One key differentiator for the Astea Alliance DSE is its ability to calculate the most efficient route and schedule by blending traditional break/fix activities with preventive maintenance activities, project activities and predictive maintenance, while also factoring in how unplanned maintenance activities influence the need for future planned service activities.
 

 9
 

The Alliance Enterprise release enhances the DSE’s scheduling capability by integrating with FedEx® and UPS® to coordinate parts delivery dates with technician arrival dates. Additionally, the DSE creates schedules that incorporate the real-world situations that technicians and customers encounter daily. It integrates with Microsoft Outlook® to consider technicians’ personal time off when creating schedules, and it also allows end customers to schedule appointments via the Alliance customer self-service mobile application or web portal. It also integrates with ADP’s WorkMarket online service provider marketplace so that customers can pick the best and most cost-effective mix of its direct employees and contingent workers and seamlessly schedule and manage them from one platform.
 
Alliance Workforce Planning
 
Workforce Planning assists in forecasting workforce requirements based on planned and unplanned orders and tracks actual results against the plan. Multiple workforce plans can be created, and plans can be maintained for different groups of resources and/or different planning periods. The Workforce planning module is flexible and can be leveraged to create plans that are comprised of days dedicated to only unplanned work, or the workforce can be allocated a percentage of planned work to be accomplished. Workforce demands for service technicians are not always consistent from period to period or from branch to branch. This often times creates a surplus of manpower in some locations and a shortage in others. Based on an Alliance Workforce plan, personnel can be temporarily transferred to another branch or action group to absorb the additional workload. A workforce plan shows the daily available hours for labor, and compares these to the daily activities from both planned and unplanned selected sources, including PM schedules, field change orders, project demands, committed sales orders and unplanned work. Plans can be frozen to compare actual time spent against the frozen plan to track performance.
Astea Alliance Enterprise Mobile Applications
 
Alliance Mobile Edge™ - Alliance Mobile Edge utilizes the latest in mobile development technology and design principles to help companies increase user adoption, boost technician productivity, improve service margins and contract profitability, and deliver a superior user experience. Alliance Mobile Edge simplifies the complexity of today’s service experience by combining deep functionality, robust customer and asset lifecycle information, and powerful new emerging technology with highly-configurable interfaces, workflow rules and reporting. The result is a platform designed to enhance technician effectiveness and efficiency in every possible way, including the ability to create a digital work environment that suits each technician’s affinity for technology and speed of learning.
 
Astea Alliance Mobile Edge sets a new standard in mobile workforce management, offering industry leading features and benefits, including:
 
 
● | A Sleek, Intuitive User Interface Inspired by the Latest Google Material Design Principles: Technicians will execute their workflow, interact with information and launch productivity-enhancing applications through a sleek new user interface (UI) inspired by Google’s Material Design principles. The familiarity of this design aids in easy adoption and allows users to intuitively understand how to interact with the application, minimizing the number of screen touches for greater efficiency. Alliance Mobile Edge leverages the latest mobile technology infrastructure, making it more powerful than ever before, with faster rendering, automatic landscape and portrait orientation changes, embedded legends, intelligent help screens and numerous other features designed to enhance user satisfaction. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unprecedented Configuration Capabilities: Alliance Mobile Edge puts the power to customize the work environment in the hands of business users. Non-technical users can now mirror the most efficient and effective way of working through robust configuration settings. Administrators, managers or supervisors can configure the application to accommodate the needs of each individual worker. The Mobile Edge customizer allows organizations to balance universal settings and workflows with local requirements by function, region, business unit, customer group or skill set. New users can start in “simple mode” utilizing only basic functions, before experience and training allows them to move into “slim” or “full mode” where additional capabilities are available. This gives workers a natural progression designed to ease them into the application, all while working in a way that accommodates an organization’s need for standardization and consistency. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Easy-to-Use Productivity Tools for Faster Learning and Greater End User Adoption: Every aspect of Alliance Mobile Edge was designed to allow technicians to focus on their job—not on the technology that supports it. Technician-enhancing tools, including team and crew collaboration, “Google-like” knowledge base search results, augmented reality and Artificial Intelligence, are all at their fingertips. These features are designed to help engineers diagnose problems, make repairs, perform preventative maintenance and resolve customer issues quickly, even if they have never before worked with a piece of equipment. Alliance Mobile Edge was designed to help overcome the challenges of an aging workforce, the ever growing number of increasingly complex new assets in the field, and new worker inexperience.

Alliance Mobile Edge is optimized to operate with the latest devices in the market including Android smartphones and tablets, iPhones, and iPads. Organizations can choose the device that works best for their environment and still be able to leverage the most powerful mobile solution designed specifically for the way field technicians work.
 
Alliance Partner Edge™
 
While Alliance Mobile Edge delivers all the features and functionality that native field technicians require, the Alliance Partner Edge Mobile application offers a streamlined version designed for third party workers to use when processing their service order assignments. Alliance Partner Edge answers the market’s increasing need to provide seamless connectivity with third party and contingent workers. It also ensures that a contingent workforce has access to the same tools as native workers; the end result of which is greater efficiency and productivity across an entire service organization and a seamless, cohesive customer experience.
Astea Alliance Extended Portals
 
Alliance Customer Connect™ web portal
 
Alliance Customer Connect is a customer self-service portal that enables service companies to give today’s highly demanding customers what they want—greater visibility into and control over their service experience. It also enables them to reduce costs by shifting customer service activities to a less expensive channel. Alliance Customer Connect is a secure, multi-level entry point web or native application environment that facilitates service, sales and account management activities without the need for direct employee involvement. It empowers the service organization’s end customers to take actions that benefit both parties. It reduces routine phone calls, emails and other communications to customer contact centers, freeing up resources for those customers that do have needs which can only be met by a real service representative. The pre-defined Entry-Level, Standard and Enterprise profiles, in connection with a security utility, are designed to ensure tight control on access to sensitive data and a range of configurable features. The portal also provides another channel to promote and sell more products and services to an existing customer base, thereby adding new revenue streams at no additional cost. The customer portal can delay or eliminate needs for contact center expansion and associated increases in facility, equipment and staffing costs.
 
Alliance Customer Edge™ mobile application
 
With the release of Alliance Version 14.5, Astea introduced the new Alliance Customer Edge mobile application that allows a company’s end customer to access the Alliance Customer Connect self-service portal from an Android or iOS mobile device. Companies can now provide customers with a convenient mobile application where they can interact with their service provider in real-time using intuitive technology that is accessible anytime, anywhere, on nearly any mobile device. In Alliance Customer Edge , clients can self-service a variety of tasks: create and edit service orders; view contract quotations; view invoices and activities; and visualize the service technician traveling in real time. Customers can also search the Knowledge Base for answers to service issues, which may prevent the need to dispatch a technician, further reducing service costs and freeing up limited resources.
 
Alliance Partner Connect™ - vendor & third-party management portal
 
The Alliance Partner Connect vendor & third-party management portal enables companies to manage their external vendors and third party service providers with a robust, secure and unified platform. This portal can now serve as their single point of information for all full-time and out-sourced stakeholders. As a result, they will have the necessary level of upstream and downstream visibility and accountability that is a critical stepping stone to better service network automation and optimization. Whether that third party is an external service agent or a vendor that supplies parts, they will now be able to track and manage all of the parties that participate in our customers’ service supply chain. Their vendors and external service agents will have access to a secure portal that allows them to enter, update and view pertinent information as it relates to a service order and logistics and reverse logistics functions. Service organizations are able to easily interconnect their entire service lifecycle ecosystem to eliminate redundant processes and drive ongoing efficiencies. Additionally, organizations benefit by increased visibility, collaboration and communication.

Astea Alliance Reporting and Business Intelligence (“Alliance BI”)
 
For proactive service management, Alliance BI provides highly visual, real-time analysis of business performance, focusing on key performance indicators—a tool that facilitates businesses’ understanding of customer behavior. Alliance BI enables the viewing of information for the entire enterprise, increasing revenues and identifying new business opportunities. Alliance BI has been designed to ensure that users of all kinds have immediate access to crucial information whenever it's needed. In the boardroom, at agent level, or even for customers, this tool effortlessly allows the viewing of performance data such as performance against service level agreements, contract profitability, product failure rate, repair turnaround times, customer satisfaction and engineer efficiency. Reports allow businesses to see how many orders have met their contractual service estimated time of arrival and how many failed, which helps organizations better understand customer satisfaction. Workloads show the available working hours at a specific location in contrast to the demand for workforce planning and optimization.

It then guides them, screen by screen, through the job – prompting them to perform standard tasks, take notes, and even record future recommended repairs or activities. With FX Mobile, field service personnel can now spend their time in the field, better serving customers, generating new business, and increasing organizations’ bottom lines. FX Mobile is an international offering that supports various languages, as well as currencies, measurement systems and time zones.
 
FX e-Service
 
FX e-Service is an extension of the FieldCentrix solution that provides a dynamic customer self-service portal that links directly from a customer’s web site. When integrated with FX Mobile software, it provides the unique capability to truly deliver real-time information from the point of service to our customers’ customers.  Working seamlessly with FX Service Center call center and dispatching software, FX e-Service gives an organization’s customers the flexibility of submitting service requests, accessing work order information, and managing their account over the Internet. Customers can receive an e-mail notification each time the status of a work order changes. This allows them to know instantly when the request has been received, scheduled, is in progress and when it is complete – all without ever calling into the office, waiting on hold or taking up valuable CSR resource.
 
FX Fleet Manager
 
FX Fleet Manager is FieldCentrix’s Global Positioning System offering to help customers manage their mobile resources more effectively. FX Fleet Manager gives companies control and management of their field operations with the expectation that they will make decisions that will increase profitability, reduce service costs, enhance customer responsiveness and satisfaction, and improve productivity and efficiency. With FX Fleet Manager, dispatchers and office personnel will always know where mobile resources are located — in real-time. Are they where they should be? Are they lost? Are they safe? There’s an emergency service request — which resource is the closest with the right parts and skill sets? All this information and more should contribute to more efficiently managed mobile resources.

FX Interchange
 
FX Interchange software provides data transporting services that allow enterprises to quickly and easily integrate FieldCentrix Enterprise to existing legacy and business systems – that are expected to maximize value from field data. FX Interchange converts data stored in FX Service Center knowledge base to XML or a Microsoft SQL Server database. Once converted, the data is accessible to other systems for basic billing and payroll extraction, and bi-directional integration purposes that should support the needs of an accounting, call center, or service dispatch integrated solution.
 
FX Interchange for JD Edwards®
 
FieldCentrix field service automation software and JD Edwards® Enterprise and EnterpriseOne applications are integrated to provide medium to large companies with an easy-to-use, cost-effective way to streamline and automate field service operations. The systems are integrated through FX Interchange™ for JD Edwards. This interface dynamically transfers key customer, work order, and accounting related information between the FieldCentrix and JD Edwards applications. This means the key functions that organizations need to run their business efficiently and cost-effectively are now seamless and completed electronically — without paper.
 
With the FieldCentrix and JD Edwards solution, service workers in the field access and enter all work order information using a mobile device at the job site. When the work is done, the service worker closes the work order and the completed information is sent wirelessly back to the office automatically. The electronic information is instantly accessible for processing by an organization’s billing system so there's no data entry needed. Because the customers’ back office no longer has to wait for the field service worker to bring in the paperwork before our customers can close the work order, customers can be billed quicker.
 
FX Mobility Express™
 
For customers who want to mobilize their workforce without deploying a full field service automation solution, FieldCentrix offers a special mobilized application development toolkit called FX Mobility Express™. The FX Mobility Express toolkit is bundled with FieldCentrix’s popular mobile middleware and allows organizations to quickly and easily build custom mobile applications that fully leverage FieldCentrix’s robust and scalable mobile infrastructure and user-friendly interface. Mobilizing applications with FX Mobility Express should provide organizations with a cost-effective way to create a solution that fits their unique business requirements on a platform built from years of mobile and wireless technology experience and used by thousands of users worldwide.
Astea Client Services
 
Professional Services
 
Astea’s typical professional services engagement includes planning, prototyping and implementing Astea’s products within the client’s organization, and follow-up engagements designed to increase the efficiency of a service operation, increase the revenue it generates, or influence the customer experience. Some customers may require customization during the initial implementation or as a follow-on activity to create a more nuanced workflow or customer experience.
 
During the initial planning phase of the engagement, Astea’s professional services personnel work closely with representatives of the customer to prepare a detailed project plan that includes a timetable, resource requirements, milestones, in-house training programs, onsite business process training and demonstrations of Astea’s product capabilities within the customer’s organization.
 
The next phase of the Astea professional services engagement is the prototyping phase, in which Astea works closely with representatives of the customer to configure Astea’s software solutions to the customer’s specific business process requirements.
 
The professional services team then performs the implementation phase, in which Astea’s professional services personnel work with the client to develop detailed data mapping, conversions, interfaces and other technical and business processes necessary to integrate Astea’s solutions into the customer’s computing environment. Ultimately, education plans are developed and executed to provide the customer with the process and system knowledge necessary to effectively utilize the software and fully implement the solution.
 

 14
 

The last phase of the engagement utilizes Astea’s professional services personnel to assist in Go Live planning and the Go Live effort. Astea will assist in the planning for installation, initialization, data preparation, operational procedures, schedules and required resources. The initialization and creation of the production database is planned and prepared for the data history, open orders and all required data for go live processing. During the cutover to the solution, Astea business resources are best utilized to assist new users with functionality/processes while Astea technical resources support the customer’s IT staff.
 
Following go live, Astea’s professional services team engages the customer in the Assessment Phase. During this effort, the delivered system is assessed to validate benefits, analyze processes to measure key performance indicators, document and understand lessons learned. To perform these assessments, Astea consultants collect and analyze the planned benefits, processes used to capture and report on the key performance indicators, and document the lessons learned from all phases of the implementation. An action plan is then developed from the lessons learned and key performance indicators for use in future phases and/or releases.
 
During all phases, professional services are generally charged on an hourly or daily basis.
 
Technical Services
 
Astea’s technical services teams provide services related to installation, data verification, functional design, technical design, system infrastructure setup or changes, customizations, Quality Assurance (QA) activities, testing and go live support. Initially, software and database installation resources are available to prepare the environment for the prototyping phase.
 
Data verification and feedback services can be provided for initial data verification analysis. These efforts are conducted to determine the present state of information as far as type, conversions, data manipulation, location, frequency, method of interface (initial load, ongoing load, data export or data import) and data integrity. Findings are documented and shared with the project team.
 
During the implementation phase, Astea’s technical services team is often engaged to assist with the functional and/or technical design as related to customer desired system personalization, minor customization and interfaces, often referred to as “gaps”. Gap solutions are assessed and categorized into system, studio, customization or interface. Utilizing the services of the customer project team, Astea professional services and Astea technical services create Business Requirement Documents (“BRDs”) for all customizations and interfaces. Astea technical services will provide specifications and a quote for the customization. The customer and Astea agree on the outcome of the customization and all expected outputs prior to the actual development customization. Following acceptance of the BRDs, code will be written as per design. QA of the code with test data sets will complete these efforts.
 
Astea’s technical services team will also provide testing and go live support, as required.
 
Customer Support
 
Astea’s customer support organization provides customers with telephone and online technical support, as well as product enhancements, updates and new software releases. The Company can provide 24/7 “follow-the-sun” support through its global support network. Local representatives support all regions of Astea’s worldwide operations. Astea personnel or a distributor’s personnel familiar with local business customs and practices provide support in real-time and usually spoken in native languages. Typically, customer support fees are established as a fixed percentage of license fees and are invoiced to customers on an annual basis. Astea’s customer support representatives are located in the United States, Europe, Israel, Japan and Australia. In addition, Astea provides customer support 24/7 with its self-service portal. The maintenance offering provides customers with support and help desk services, as well as software service packs and unspecified release upgrades for the modules they have purchased.
Education & Training
 
Application Training:
 
Key business owners responsible for the implementation of the core components will receive in-depth training designed to present the features, functionality and terminology of Astea’s solutions. The objective of this training is to provide the audience with a working knowledge of these solutions. This exposure to the system will enable project communication and add insight into specific business processes.
 
End-user training plans and documents are created during the implementation phase. These plans and documentation are utilized to conduct end-user training sessions prior to go live.
 

 15
 

Technical Training:
 
Software and database installation/creation training is provided, as required and/or recommended.
 
System Administration training provides the customer’s IT staff pre-requisite knowledge to manipulate and manage administrative tasks associated with the Astea solutions. Included within these tasks are: Security, Batch Applications, Escalation, Import, etc.
 
Many customers are interested in performing their own personalization and minor customization to the system. Training sessions are available to enhance customer understanding of available options for personalization and how to perform customizations.
 
Customers
 
The Company estimates that it has sold licenses to approximately 700 customers ranging from small, rapidly growing companies to large, multinational corporations with geographically dispersed operations and remote offices. The broad applicability of the Company’s products is demonstrated by the wide range of companies across many markets and industries that use one or more of Astea’s products, including customers in information technology, medical devices and diagnostic systems, industrial controls and instrumentation, retail/point-of-sale systems equipment, HVAC, office automation equipment, imaging systems, fire and security, gaming/leisure equipment, facilities management, telecommunications and other related industries with equipment sales and service.  In both 2018 and 2017, there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenues.
Sales and Marketing
 
The Company markets its products through a worldwide network of direct and indirect sales and services offices with corporate headquarters in the United States and regional headquarters in the United Kingdom (Europe, Middle East and Africa Operations), Japan and Australia (Asia Pacific Operations). Sales partners include distributors (value-added resellers, system integrators and sales agents) and OEM partners. The Company actively seeks to expand its reseller network and establish an international indirect distribution channel targeted at the mid-market tier. See “Risk Factors — Need to Expand Indirect Sales.”
 
Astea’s direct sales force employs a consultative approach to selling, working closely with prospective clients to understand and define their needs and determine how such needs can be addressed by the Company’s products. These clients typically represent the mid- to high-end of the market. A prospect development organization comprised of telemarketing representatives, who are engaged in outbound telemarketing and inbound inquiry response to a variety of marketing vehicles, develops and qualifies sales leads prior to referral to the direct sales staff. Additional prospects are identified and qualified through the networking of direct sales staff and the Company’s management as part of daily business activities.
 
The modular structure of Astea’s software and its ongoing product development efforts provide opportunities for incremental sales of product modules and consulting services to existing accounts. See “Risk Factors — Continued Dependence on Large Contracts May Result in Lengthy Sales and Implementation Cycles and Impact Revenue Recognition and Cash Flow.”
 Astea’s corporate marketing department is responsible for product marketing, lead generation and marketing communications, including the Company’s corporate website, dialogue with high tech industry analysts, trade conferences, advertising, digital marketing, online and traditional seminars, direct mail, product collateral, public relations and partner development. Based on feedback from customers, analysts, business partners and market data, the marketing department provides input and direction for the Company’s ongoing product development efforts and opportunities for professional services.
 One of our major long-term goals is our transformation to a sales and marketing-driven culture. In 2017, Astea made significant changes in both sales and marketing, improving personnel, process, approach and infrastructure. That year, Astea brought Emily Hackman in to lead the reinvigorated marketing initiatives and under her leadership we have seen many positive changes to our brand, our message and our positioning in the marketplace. We also began to enhance our marketing strategies to improve how we communicates the unique value of our products, services and industry expertise.
 In 2018, the corporate marketing department continued its reinvention by beginning a brand transformation that will continue into 2019 and beyond. We have modernized our marketing approach to better engage with today’s empowered and informed B2B buyer, and have created greater integration between our sales and service departments.

Critical components of our brand transformation include: a new, mobile-friendly website; modern imagery and videos that better explain our value proposition; updated sales collateral and sales enablement tools; new content marketing pieces that position Astea as a thought leader; and lastly, the re-engagement of our Gartner partnership. The Gartner opinion carries much weight when companies are looking for new software vendors, so we are happy to partner with them once again to ensure that they have a full and complete understanding of our technology that would allow them to recommend us to potential buyers.
 
Astea’s international sales accounted for 44% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 47% of the Company’s revenues in 2017.  See “Risk Factors — Expansion of International Sales.”
 
Product Development
 
Astea’s product development strategy is to provide products that perform with exceptional depth and breadth of functionality and are easy to implement, use and maintain. Products are designed to be flexible, modular and scalable, so that they can be implemented incrementally in phases and expanded to satisfy the evolving information requirements of Astea’s clients and their customers.
 
The Company uses widely accepted commercially available application development tools from Microsoft Corporation. These software tools provide the Company’s customers with the flexibility to deploy Astea’s products across a variety of hardware platforms, operating systems and relational database management systems. The latest Astea Alliance solution suite is engineered for existing and emerging Microsoft technologies such as Microsoft.NET Framework, Visual Studio 2012, Windows Presentation Framework, Internet Information Server, and supports Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 & 2012 R2, MS SQL 2012 & 2012 R2, MS SQL 2015, Oracle Databases 10 & 11, and BizTalk Server. Astea Alliance supports deployments in both on-premise and cloud environments by leveraging a multi-tenant architecture. This multi-tenant architecture supports running the application using one set of hardware/software, serving multiple client organizations (tenants). The computing resources and application code are generally shared between all the tenants on a server. Each tenant has its own set of data that remains logically isolated from data that belongs to all other tenants.
 
In addition to product development that is conducted at Company facilities in the United States and Israel, Astea may participate in contractual relationships with complementary technology companies to reduce time-to-market with new product capabilities in order to continually increase its value proposition to both existing and prospective customers.
 
The Company’s expense for product development for both the years ended December 31, 2018 was and 2017 was $1,067,000 and $1,303,000, respectively. These expenses amounted to 4% and 5% of total revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Company’s capitalized software development costs were $3,144,000 and $2,633,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Total software development costs increased $275,000 to $4,211,000 in 2018 compared to $3,936,000 in 2017. Total software development costs, including capitalized software development costs were 15% of revenue in both 2018 and 2017.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to allocate substantial resources to its development effort for the upgrade of its suite of products.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors — Need for Development of New Products.”
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company’s software products are distributed electronically via a client-server file transfer protocol.  Included with the software products are security keys (a software piracy protection) and documentation available electronically and in hard copy.
Competition
 
The service management software market is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. To maintain or increase its position in the industry, the Company will need to continually enhance its current product offerings, introduce new products and features and maintain its professional services capabilities. The Company currently competes on the basis of the depth and breadth of its integrated product features and functions, including the adaptability and scalability of its products to specific customer environments; the ability to deploy complex systems locally, regionally, nationally and internationally; product quality; ease-of-use; reliability and performance; breadth of professional services; integration of Astea’s offerings with other enterprise applications; price; implementation time; and the availability of Astea’s products on popular operating systems, relational databases, cloud-based, Internet and communications platforms.
 
Competitors vary in size, scope and breadth of the products and services offered. The Company encounters competition generally from a number of sources, including other software companies, third-party professional services organizations that develop custom software, and information systems departments of potential customers developing proprietary, custom software. In the service management marketplace, the Company competes against publicly held companies and numerous smaller, privately held companies. Some of the Company’s competitors include SAP AG (“SAP”), Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”), IFS, Service Max and a number of smaller privately held companies. See “Risk Factors — Competition in the CRM Software Market is Intense.”

Licenses and Intellectual Property
 
Astea considers its software proprietary and licenses its products to its customers under written license agreements.  The Company also employs an encryption system that restricts a user’s access to source code to further protect the Company’s intellectual property.  Because the Company’s products allow customers to use the software’s built-in features to customize their applications without altering the framework source code, the framework source code for the Company’s products is typically neither licensed nor provided to customers.  The Company does, however, license source code from time to time and maintains certain third-party source code escrow arrangements.
 
The Company seeks to protect its products through a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret and fair business practice laws.  The Company also requires employees, consultants and third parties to sign nondisclosure agreements.  Despite these precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy certain portions of the Company’s products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that the Company regards as proprietary.  The Company presently has no patents or patent applications pending.  See “Risk Factors — Dependence on Proprietary Technology.”
 
Because the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change, Astea believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than current legal protections.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company, including its subsidiaries, had a total of 170 full-time employees worldwide, 81 in the United States, 16 in the United Kingdom, 3 in the Netherlands, 44 in Israel, 11 in Australia and 15 in Japan.  In addition, we have 3 part-time employees in Israel.  The Company’s future performance depends, in significant part, upon the continued service of its key technical and management personnel and its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel in all areas of its operations.  See “Risk Factors — Dependence on Key Personnel; Competition for Employees.” None of the Company’s employees is represented by a labor union.  The Company has not experienced any work stoppages and considers its relationships with its employees to be good.
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1979 under the name Applied System Technologies, Inc. In 1992, the Company changed its name to Astea International Inc.  In May 1995, the Company reincorporated in Delaware. In July 1995, the Company completed its initial public offering of Common Stock.
 The Company released a new system architecture based on Microsoft.NET during the third quarter of 2004. On September 21, 2005, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of FieldCentrix, Inc.  In 2013, Astea Alliance 11.0 was released, which introduced an abundance of new features and enhancements that were developed based on three primary concepts; optimizing and streamlining processes, enabling proactive service insight and intelligence at every level, and significantly increasing ease of use and customizations without technical skills. Most importantly, this version gave customers the option to use Alliance as either as an on-premise or cloud application, allowing every company to choose the right platform that aligns with their strategy and IT ecosystem.
 In October 2016, Astea released Version 14.0, and subsequently released Version 14.5 in September 2017, delivering an extensive number of both technical and functional advancements to help companies catapult revenue growth, optimize the employee/customer/partner interaction experience, drive productivity improvements, and boost customer satisfaction levels. This release was a major step in unifying and connecting all service stakeholders—both within and outside of an organization—into one cohesive service ecosystem focused on delivering superior service outcomes for a company and its customers. Designed to share information and data effortlessly through more physical and digital mediums that ever before possible, Astea Alliance 14.5 provides extensive connectivity designed to strengthen the relationship between a service provider and its customer: portals that provide a 360 degree view of the relationship; the ability to leverage contingent worker job markets; seamless scheduling of employee, third party and contingent workers within one environment; and a best-in-class mobile experience for technicians, subcontractors and customers.
 
 18
 

In September 2018, Astea released Alliance Enterprise (Version 15), the newest version of its award-winning Alliance field service management and mobility platform. We believe that Alliance Enterprise introduces to the field service industry an entirely new perspective on how an enterprise-grade technology can unify the increasingly complex ecosystem in which service-driven companies must operate. This transformational release is not just a new version of one of the most capable field service applications in the industry. It is expected to be the transition of our technology into a platform that gives customers the power to streamline workflows to create differentiating customer experiences, integrate freely into any other environment, seamlessly and consistently interact with customers and stakeholders via nearly any medium, and do so using a new toolset that does not require technical capabilities. It is designed to give organizations the ability to maximize the value of any workers—employees, third parties and contingent workers—during any type of service activity throughout the entire lifecycle. The platform also automatically updates end customers on the status of their service activities and helps management understand organizational performance out-of-the box.
 The launch of Alliance Enterprise was the latest step Astea has taken to expand the scope and definition of service. As the company that first defined service management technology, Astea continues to empower its customers to achieve even higher levels of operational efficiency, profitability and differentiation.
