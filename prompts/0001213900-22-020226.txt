ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

History and Company Overview
 
We are a provider of modular facilities (“Modules”). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modules we supplied were primarily for retail, restaurant and military use and were manufactured by third party suppliers using our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise, which modifies code-engineered cargo shipping containers and purpose-built modules for use for safe and sustainable commercial, industrial and residential building. With our acquisition in September 2020 of Echo DCL, LLC (“Echo”), one of our key supply chain providers, we now have more control over the manufacturing process and have increased our product offerings to add Modules made out of wood.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. Our partnership with Clarity Lab Solutions, LLC (“Clarity Labs”) in Boca Raton, Florida, a CLIA-certified laboratory, has allowed us to provide laboratory testing in our Modules. During 2021, we also began to focus on acquiring property to build multi-family housing communities that allows us to utilize the manufacturing services of Echo. 

Prior to October 2019, our business model was solely a project-based construction model pursuant to which we were responsible for the design and construction of finished products that incorporated our technology primarily to customers in the retail, restaurant, military and education industries throughout the United States. In October 2019, we changed our business model for our residential building construction to a royalty fee model and entered into a five-year exclusive license with CPF GP 2019-1 LLC (“CPF”) under which CPF licensed on an exclusive basis our proprietary technology and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products in the United States (and its territories) for residential use, including, without limitation, single-family residences and multi-family residences, but excluding military housing. On June 15, 2021, we terminated the exclusive license by mutual agreement and ceased our royalty fee model.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our core customer base was comprised of architects, landowners, builders and developers who use our Modules in commercial and residential structures. Our cargo modified Modules allow for the redesign, repurpose and conversion of heavy-gauge steel cargo shipping containers into SGBlocks™, which are safe green building blocks for commercial, industrial, and residential building construction, rather than consuming new steel and lumber. Our technology and expertise is also used to purpose-build modules, or prefabricated steel modular units customized for use in modular construction (“SGPBMs” and, together with SGBlocks™, “Modules”), primarily to augment or complement an SGBlocks™ structure.

 In March 2020, we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. In May, we entered into a joint development agreement with Grimshaw Design to assist with the deployment of our D-Tec suite of prefabricated health facilities for on-site immediate COVID-19 testing. In September 2020, we entered the U.S. test lab market by forming a joint venture with Clarity Labs , a manufacturer and market leader of rapid diagnostic tests, to launch CLIA-certified laboratories.  Our joint venture with Clarity Labs has allowed us to not only supply our D-Tec suite of prefabricated health facilities but also allows us to provide testing services at such facilities. We have supplied our building modular coronavirus testing centers and provide testing services for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Memorial in Wayne County, Michigan and have been selected as a Trusted Testing Partner (TTP) for Hawaii’s COVID-19 travel testing program.
  
In September 2020, we acquired substantially all the assets of Echo, a Texas limited liability company, except for Echo's real estate holdings for which we obtained a right of first refusal. Echo is a container/modular manufacturer based in Durant, Oklahoma specializing in the design and construction of permanent modular and temporary modular buildings and was one of our key supply chain partners.  Echo catered to the military, education, administration facilities, healthcare, government, commercial and residential customers. This acquisition has allowed us to expand our reach for our Modules and has offered us an opportunity to vertically integrate a large portion of our cost of goods sold, as well as increase margins, productivity and efficiency in the areas of design, estimating, manufacturing and delivery.
  2021 Real Estate Developments

During February 2021, we formed SGB Development Corp. (“SG DevCorp”), our wholly owned subsidiary, which was formed for the purpose of real property development utilizing our technologies and our manufacturing facility.

On May 10, 2021, we acquired a 50+ acre site in Lago Vista, Texas for $3,500,000, paid in cash, pursuant to the Unimproved Property Contract, dated February 25, 2021, with Northport Harbor LLC. The acquired parcel sits on Lake Travis on the Colorado River in central Texas and subsequent to the year ending December 31, 2021, the property is listed for sale.

On May 31, 2021, SG DevCorp, acquired a 50% membership interest for $600,000 in a limited liability company that is building affordable housing in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area to be known as “Norman Berry Village”. SGB DevCorp has partnered with CMC Development Group, a New York City-based real estate development firm with national expertise providing design build services. We expect the project to develop 125,000 square feet and build approximately 138 units at Norman Berry Village. 

On June 24, 2021, SG DevCorp, as member, entered into an Operating Agreement, with Jacoby Development, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“JDI”), as manager, dated June 24, 2021 (the “Operating Agreement”), for JDI-Cumberland Inlet, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (“JDI-Cumberland”), pursuant to which we acquired a 10% non-dilutable equity interest (“LLC Interest”) in JDI-Cumberland and agreed to contribute $3,000,000 in capital to it for the development of a 1,286 acre waterfront parcel in downtown historic St. Marys, Georgia (the “Project”). SG DevCorp in conjunction with Jacoby Development of Atlanta, Georgia expects to develop a mixed-use destination community. The closing on the 1,286-acre waterfront parcel occurred prior to the end of Q2 2021.

 The Operating Agreement provides JDI with the right, at its option, to purchase the LLC Interest from SG  DevCorp on or before June 24, 2023 for $3,000,000, plus an amount equal to an annual internal rate of return (IRR) on such funds of forty (40%) percent (i.e., $1,200,000 annualized). After June 24, 2023, the Operating Agreement provides JDI with the right, at its option, to purchase the LLC Interest from SG DevCorp for $3,000,000, plus an amount equal to an IRR of thirty-two and one-half (32.5%) percent (i.e., $975,000 annualized). The Operating Agreement also provides that if JDI receives a good faith, bona fide written offer from an unaffiliated third party to purchase all or any portion of the Project, JDI shall first offer the Project to SG DevCorp at the same price Echo, entered into a Fabrication and Building Services Agreement (“Building Services Agreement”) with JDI-Cumberland to design, fabricate and install various improvements for the Project using modular structures, pursuant to budgets prepared by SG Echo submitted for approval to JDI-Cumberland, including a marina, town center, apartments and single family units, townhomes, commercial, retail and lodging buildings/structures, eco-tourism park, camping yurts, cabins and cottages. The Building Services Agreement has an initial term of three years, with two-year automatic renewal provisions. 

On July 14, 2021, SG DevCorp issued a Real Estate Lien Note, dated July 14, 2021, in the principal amount of $2,000,000 (the “Note”), secured by a Deed of Trust, dated July 14, 2021, on its 50+ acre Lake Travis project site in Lago Vista, Texas and a related Assignment of Leases and Rents, dated July 8, 2021, for net loan proceeds of $1,958,233 after fees. The Note has a term of one (1) year, provides for payments of interest only at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and may be prepaid without penalty commencing nine (9) months after its issuance date. If the Note is prepaid prior to nine (9) months after its issuance date, a 0.5% prepayment penalty is due. SG DevCorp intends to use the proceeds of the Note for its development project.

 On October 28, 2021, SG Echo entered into a Lease Agreement (the “Lease”) with May Properties, LLC, to lease an approximately 56,775 square foot facility located at 101 Waldron Road in Durant Oklahoma (the “Premises”). The date on which SG Echo will become responsible for paying rent under the Lease (the “Lease Commencement Date”) will be the earlier of (i) the date SG Echo begins to operate its business on the Premises or (ii) ninety (90) days after October 28, 2021. The initial term of the Lease will commence on the Lease Commencement Date and expire one hundred and twenty (120) months after the Lease Commencement Date, with two five-year options to renew. SG Echo’s monthly base rent for the Premises will start at $15,991.63 commencing on the Lease Commencement Date and will increase at the rate of two percent (2%) on an annual basis up to a maximum monthly base rent of $19,111.47. The leased Premises is expected to add two new production lines for Echo to manufacture projects for our subsidiary, SG DevCorp and others customers. Upon Echo completing certain improvements to the Premises, it will receive a credit against future rent, not to exceed $750,000, for the cost and expense of the improvements to be applied pro rata over the remaining term of the Lease. The Lease also grants Echo an option to purchase the Premises for (i) $1,000,000 after the fifteenth (15th) through the end of the twenty-fourth (24th) full calendar month of the Lease or (ii) $1,050,000 during the twenty-fifth (25th) through the end of the thirty-sixth (36th) full calendar month of the Lease. Pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, dated October 28, 2021, Echo’s obligations under the Lease have been guaranteed by the Company. 

   In connection with the Lease, Echo entered into a Loan Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) with the Durant Industrial Authority (the “Authority”) pursuant to which it received $750,000 to be used for improvements on the Premises and issued to the Authority a non-interest bearing Forgivable Promissory Note in the principal amount of $750,000 (the “Durant Note”). The Durant Note is due on April 29, 2029 and guaranteed by us, provided, if no event of default has occurred under the Durant Note or Loan Agreement, one-third (1/3) of the balance of the Durant Note will be forgiven on April 29, 2027, one-half (1/2) of the balance of the Durant Note will be forgiven on April 29, 2028, and the remainder of the balance of the Durant Note will be forgiven on April 29, 2029. The Loan Agreement includes a covenant by Echo to employ a minimum of 75 full-time employees in Durant Oklahoma and pay them no less than 1.5 times the federal minimum wage, and provides SG Echo 24 months to comply with the provisions.

On November 10, 2021 we entered into a Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement) with the Durant Industrial Authority to acquire 100% ownership of approximately 114 mixed-use acres in Durant, Oklahoma for $865,000.  We anticipate building approximately 300 residential units and up to 680,000 square feet of industrial manufacturing space on the mixed-use property.  The closing on the 114 mixed-use acres occurred in the first quarter of 2022.  

Terminated License Agreement with CPF GP 2019-1 LLC

 On June 15, 2021, we terminated that certain Exclusive License Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2019 (the “License Agreement”), with CPF, pursuant to which we had granted CPF an exclusive license solely within the United States and its legal territories to our technology, intellectual property, any improvements thereto, and any related permits, in order to develop and commercialize products within the field of design and project management platforms for residential use, including single-family residences and multi-family residences, but excluding military.  In connection with the termination of the License, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the "Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement") with CPF, and Capital Plus Financial, LLC (“Capital Plus”), a limited partner of CPF, pursuant to which the License Agreement was terminated, we released CPF and CPF MF 2019-1 LLC (“CPF MF”) for any claims in exchange for releases from CPF and Capital Plus and we received an assignment of CPF’s right under certain circumstances to a $1.25 million redemption distribution from CPF MF under its Operating Agreement. We and Paul Galvin previously made loans to CPF in the principal amount of $650,000 and $100,000 evidenced by promissory notes pursuant to the terms of a certain Loan Agreement. The loans are unaffected by the Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement and remain in effect and outstanding in accordance with the terms of the notes evidencing such loans.
Under the License Agreement, during the initial term, CPF had agreed to pay us a royalty of (i) five percent (5%) on the first $20,000,000 of gross revenues derived from CPF’s commercialization of the license (net of customary discounts, sales taxes, delivery charges, and amounts for returns) (the “Gross Revenues”), (ii) four and one-half percent (4.5%) on the next $30,000,000 of Gross Revenues, and (iii) five percent (5%) on all Gross Revenues thereafter (collectively, the “Royalty”), subject to the following minimum royalty payments determined on a cumulative basis during the initial term: $500,000 in year 1, $750,000 in year 2, $1,500,000 in year 3, $2,000,000 in year 4, and $2,500,000 in year 5. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not receive any royalty payments under the License Agreement.  
 
On October 3, 2019, we had entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the “Loan Agreement”) with CPF, which was amended on October 15, 2019 and further amended on November 7, 2019, pursuant to which we agreed to loan CPF $750,000 at an annual interest rate of five percent (5%), with a maturity date of July 31, 2023. Under the Loan Agreement, as amended, we agreed to advance to CPF the first installment of the principal amount, equal to $500,000, no later than January 31, 2020 and the second installment of the principal amount, equal to $250,000, no later than April 15, 2020. As security for this loan, we received a security interest in all of CPF’s membership interests in CPF MF, a Texas limited liability company of which CPF GP is the general partner. If we failed to fund either principal installment, such failure would have constituted a default under the Loan Agreement and a cross default under the License Agreement. On January 21, 2020, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, CPF issued to us a promissory note in the principal amount of $400,000 (the “Company Note”) and issued to Paul Galvin, our Chairman and CEO, a promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 (the “Galvin Note”). The transaction closed on January 22, 2020, on which date we loaned CPF $400,000 and Mr. Galvin personally loaned CPF $100,000 on behalf of us. The Company Note and Galvin Note bear interest at five percent (5%) per annum, payable, together with the unpaid principal amount of the promissory notes, on the earlier of the July 31, 2023 maturity date or upon the liquidation, redemption sale or issuance of a dividend upon the LLC interests in CPF MF 2019-1 LLC; provided, that the terms of the Galvin Note provide that all interest payments due to Mr. Galvin under the Galvin Note shall be paid directly to, and for the benefit of, our Company.

     Joint Development Agreement with Grimshaw
 
                On May 27, 2020, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Grimshaw Design, LLC ("Grimshaw"). Grimshaw is engaged in architecture, planning and industrial design. Our joint agreement is to develop a prototype and "proof of concept" for a scalable, customizable and rapidly deployable medical facility with laboratory systems, testing booths, spaces for in-patient and out-patient care and/or other medical care units, based upon Grimshaw's designs and utilizing our container-based or other modular structures, or pre-fabricated modular structures jointly developed by us and Grimshaw. 
 
On July 6, 2020, we expanded our relationship with Grimshaw when we entered into another Joint Development Agreement with Grimshaw. Our joint agreement is to develop a prototype and "proof of concept" for a scalable, customizable and rapidly deployable educational facility with classrooms, spaces for teaching, workshops, dining, recreation, sports and/or other education-related purposes, based upon Grimshaw's designs and utilizing our container-cased or other modular structures, or pre-fabricated modular structures jointly developed by us and Grimshaw.
 
On November 19, 2020, we and Memorial Hospital, of Michigan (“Memorial), entered into a Professional Services and Capital Support Contract (“PSCSC”) with Wayne County, Michigan to appoint Memorial the primary contractor for the construction of portable on-site laboratory facilities for COVID-19 testing. The PSCCS engages us as a sub-contractor to render services and support to Memorial in connection with the fulfillment of statements of work submitted from Wayne County to Memorial. The program deploys the D-Tec Product Series, designed by Grimshaw and developed by SG Blocks, to deliver COVID-19 PCR testing and on-site CLIA lab services directly into high risk and underserved areas.  20,352,054 D-Tec 1 Collection Units were deployed throughout Wayne County and provided COVID-19 test samples to the CLIA lab for clinical testing services. The COVID-19 testing program with Memorial ceased operations in November 2021.
 
  Joint Venture with Clarity Lab Solutions, LLC and Chicago Airport Testing, LLC
 
On August 27, 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement (the “Clarity Mobile Venture”) with Clarity Labs, a CLIA-certified laboratory based in Miami, Florida. Under the Clarity Mobile Venture, we, along with Clarity Labs have agreed to jointly market, sell, and distribute certain lab testing products and services (“Clarity Mobile Venture”). On November 12, 2020, Clarity Mobile Venture entered into a contract with the City of Los Angeles for the operations of a COVID-19 PCR Test Laboratory at Los Angeles International Airport ("LAX") to provide a full-service modular COVID-19 laboratory and testing facility onsite at Los Angeles International Airport.   This facility conducts PCR tests with results available within three hours for passengers and airline crew, and no later than 24 hours for LAX airport employees. Additionally, other rapid coronavirus tests including antigen tests were deployed at LAX in 2021. Clarity Mobile Venture is the primary operator. On November 16, 2020, we announced that the State of Hawaii had selected Clarity Labs and Clarity Mobile Venture to provide COVID-19 testing and clinical laboratory at LAX for testing of passengers travelling between Los Angeles and Hawaii.  In January 2021, we and other third parties formed Chicago Airport Testing LLC (“CAT”). CAT is in the business of marketing, selling, distributing leasing and otherwise commercially exploiting certain products and services in the COVID-19 testing and other medical industry.  CAT collected rental revenue from subleasing to a consortium of government entities assisting in COVID-19 testing.  The consortium of government entities exercised their rights to vacant in third quarter 2021 and CAT has ceased operations.  For the year-end December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $31,400,000 in revenue related to activities through these joint ventures, which is included in medical revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

Acquisition of Echo DCL, LLC

On September 17, 2020, we, through SG Echo, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Echo DCL, LLC, a container/modular manufacturer that had been a key supplier of ours, to acquire substantially all the assets of Echo, except for Echo's real estate holdings, for which SG Echo has obtained a right of first refusal to acquire same. On September 23, 2020, we, SG Echo and Echo DCL completed the transactions as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, at the Closing we paid to Echo an aggregate of $1,059,600 in cash, subject to the escrow of certain of the purchase price funds, and SG Echo agreed to pay certain of Echo’s indebtedness, including the obligation to (i) satisfy a Guidance Line of Credit loan (“GLOC Loan”) in the principal amount of approximately $616,000 ($316,432 of which payoff proceeds were delivered by SG Echo to Echo DCL at the closing), (ii) pay the debt service on certain of Echo’s indebtedness in the approximate principal amount of $1.7 million for 12 months following the closing, (iii) pay the monthly principal and interest due under the BTH Credit Line in the principal amount of $500,000 for 12 months following the closing and if Echo DCL has not fully satisfied the outstanding principal and interest due under the BTH Credit Line and caused the BTH lender to release and terminate any encumbrances on the Purchase Assets arising out of the BTH Credit Line, we have the right to pay the outstanding principal and interest due, and (iv) pay earn out payments equal to the net income received from the acquired business during the 3-month period beginning on the first day of the first full month that is 3 months after the closing date, the 3-month period following the first earn out period and the 3-month period following the second earn out period, payable in 50% in cash and 50% in shares of our common stock to be valued a $2.50 per share; provided, that up to approximately $300,000 of any amounts paid in respect of the GLOC Loan, and any amounts paid in respect of the debt service on Echo’s indebtedness and line of credit with BTH Bank, as described in subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, shall be offset against and reduce the earnout payments due to Echo DCL. In no event may the number of shares of common stock to be issued to Echo exceed 19.99% of our outstanding shares on the date of the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement. As of December, 31, 2021, no earn out payments have been issued to Echo DCL.
 
  Products Produced with Our GreenSteel™ Modular Technology
 
The building products developed with our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise are generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. The use of the SG Blocks building structure typically provides between four to six points towards the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification levels, including reduced site disturbance, resource reuse, recycled content, innovation in design and use of local and regional materials. Due to the ability of SG  Blocks to satisfy such requirements, we believe the products produced utilizing our technology and expertise is a leader in environmentally sustainable construction.
 
There are three core product offerings that utilize our involves GreenSteel technology and engineering expertise. The first product offering involves GreenSteel Modules, which are the structural core and shell of an SG Blocks building. We procure the containers, engineer required openings with structural steel enforcements, paint the containers and then deliver them on-site, where the customer or a customer’s general contractor will complete the entire finish out and installation. The second product offering involves replicating the process to create the GreenSteel product and, in addition, installing selected materials, finishes and systems (including, but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing system) and delivering SG Blocks pre-fabricated containers to the site for a third party licensed general contractor to complete the final finish out and installation. Finally, the third product offering is the completely fabricated and finished SG Blocks building (including but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing systems), including erecting the final unit on site and completing any other final steps. The building is ready for occupancy and/or use as soon as installation is completed. Construction administration and/or project management services are typically included in our product offerings.

Other Modular Products
 
We also produce pre-fabricated modular containers, for both residential and commercial use, at Echo using wood as the base material instead of steel containers. We have found that many clients prefer a mix of wood and steel containers for their projects, wood for aesthetics and cost-savings, and steel for stability and durability.  Since our acquisition of Echo, approximately 75% of our Module sales have been for wood-based modules. 
 
ESR Approval

In April 2017, the ICC Evaluation Service, LLC (“ICC-ES”) granted us an Evaluation Service Report (“ESR”) for the SGBlocks structural building materials. We believe we are the first modular building company to receive such certification. Our ESR indicates that the ICC-ES recognizes the suitability and technical capabilities of the SGBlocks structural building materials for use in compliance with the International Building Code and Residential Code, the California Building Code and Residential Code, and the Florida Building Code—Building and Residential. We believe our ESR has expedited reviews and approvals by state and local building departments, helped the SGBlocks concept gain wider acceptance in the construction industry and opened up licensing opportunities internationally We also believe the ESR will make it more difficult for other companies in the industry to compete with us because the quality control and design acceptance criteria are specific to us and our associated facilities.
 
Our ESR is site-specific; therefore, only the inspected and approved facilities can place the ICC-ES mark on the containers. We currently source or fabricate our SGBlocks from 18 facilities located throughout the continental United States. The ICC-ES has currently approved six of these facilities to place the ICC-ES medallion and we will seek ICC-ES approval for additional facilities on an as needed basis. Each of these facilities undergo an annual inspection by ICC-ES. Currently, each of these facilities has been re-certified by ICC-ES and is current with their recertifications. All SGBlocks manufactured at these facilities have an ESR medallion that validates the quality control process. Because our ESR does not cover SGPBMs, this certification does not extend to buildings constructed using SGPBMs. 
  
  Target Markets

To date, the target markets for the products that utilize our technology and expertise have been the new construction market in the United States. The Modules that utilize our technology and expertise have a particular application in a number of segments, including:

● | Single-Family and Multi-Family Housing
--+---------------------------------------


● | Restaurants and Quick Service Restaurants
--+------------------------------------------


● | Military 
--+-------------------------------------------
● | Education/Student Housing 
● | Health Care including medical laboratories


● | Equipment Enclosures and Stacking Solutions
--+--------------------------------------------
● | Office and Commercial 
● | Commercial and residential customers 
● | Athletic facilities and support structures 
● | Administration Facilities 


In addition, future target markets for expansion of such products and services include data centers, warehouse/public storage, reclamation/drop off centers and medical. 

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Although the construction industry is highly competitive, we are committed to educating the real estate community on the benefits of our technology and expertise and positioning the products that utilize our technology and expertise as complementary to the strategy of developers, rather than as competition. We may compete for building opportunities with regional, national and international builders that possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and competition within the general construction industry may increase if there is future consolidation in the land development and construction industry or from new building technologies that could arise. Within the modular building space, we compete against a small number of companies providing modular-building services. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of building materials; technical product knowledge and expertise; previous experience in modular construction; consulting or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and the marketability of our ESR within the structural building space.

We believe we can distinguish ourselves from our competitors on the basis of our ESR, quality, cost and construction time savings when utilizing our technology and expertise. Our proprietary construction for our cargo based containers method is typically less expensive than traditional construction methods, particularly in urban locations and multi-story projects, and construction time is also generally reduced by using our construction method, reducing both construction and soft costs substantially. SGBlocks are designed to be hurricane-, tornado- and earthquake-resistant and able to withstand harsh climate conditions. The flexibility and the stack-ability of the Modules allows architects, developers and owners to design Modules to meet their specific needs. In addition, our management team has a breadth of knowledge in the modular building industry with a combined 130 years of experience. Our experience in a wide range of construction applications, including office, enclosures, residential, commercial, quick service restaurants, experiential and restaurant applications, gives us an advantage over our competition through the use of market-based prototypes. With the acquisition of Echo, we have been able to vertically integrate our manufacturing process and reduce some of our cost of goods sold, productivity and efficiency.

Our Customers
 
We market our construction products to a broad customer base, comprised primarily of contractors, home builders, building owners and other resellers across the continental United States and we also market our services and technology to customers in Canada.   In addition, as stated above, we now also supply our Modules to the medical community. SG Blocks customers come from all walks in the economy and include government agencies, private developers, the U.S. Military, the Native American Community, the QSR operators, individuals and families requiring COVID-19 tests and a host of entrepreneurs looking to launch ideas and technology. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 78% and 79%, respectively, of the Company’s gross accounts receivable were due from four and three customers. Revenue relating to one and three customers represented approximately 80% and 61% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Our Suppliers and Partners
 
Although the primary use of shipping containers is for transportation, when constructing SGBlocks, we use standard materials to modify the container shell structure and finish out the modules. In addition, we use the same standard construction materials to construct and finish out the wood base modules produced at Echo. We utilize the same suppliers and materials used by conventional construction. Materials such as windows, doors, insulation mechanical systems, electrical systems and other such supplies are all off-the-shelf materials and equipment commonly available and used in the industry.  We believe we have access to alternative suppliers, with limited disruption to the business, should circumstances change with its existing suppliers.
Intellectual Property
 
We operate under our United States registered trademarks “SGBlocks” and “GreenSteel” and our trademarked “SG” logo.  
 
  Government Regulation and Approval
 
The design and construction of buildings is controlled at the project level, with local and state municipalities having jurisdiction in most cases. All buildings, conventionally built or modularly built, are subject to published building codes and criteria that must be achieved during the architectural and engineering phase in order to be approved for construction. There are no specific regulations that impact our technology. While much of the regulation in our industry occurs at the project level, we are subject to various federal, state and local government regulations applicable to the business in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We strive to operate in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and, in addition, that our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices comply with related regulations.

Our Emergence from Bankruptcy
 
On October 15, 2015, SGB and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption In re SG Blocks, Inc. et al., Case No. 15-12790. On February 29, 2016, the Debtors filed a Disclosure Statement (the “Disclosure Statement”), attaching a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”), along with a motion seeking approval of the Disclosure Statement by the Bankruptcy Court. On June 30, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.

Prior to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue: (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Common Stock”) of which 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016; and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Preferred Stock”), none of which were issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date.
 
On the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016, pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to Hillair Capital Investments L.P. (“HCI”) in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the “Exit Facility”). 
 
On the Effective Date, all previously issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 8,195 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split) of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “New Common Stock”), to the holders of Former Common Stock. Further, under the Plan, upon the Effective Date, certain members of SGB’s management were entitled to receive options (the “Management Options”) to acquire approximately 10,919 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split), of SGB’s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis.
 
  
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and SGB’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SGB filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 1,801,670 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split) of preferred stock, par value $1.00, all of which were issued upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Prior to our public offering that we consummated in June 2017, all outstanding shares of our preferred stock, were converted into 90,084 shares of common stock. No preferred stock currently remains outstanding.
 
Reverse Stock Split

On February 5, 2020, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share amounts set forth in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the split effected in February 2020 as if it had occurred as of the earliest period presented and unless otherwise stated, all other share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split effected in February 2020.  
Recent Financing Developments 
 
On October 27, 2021, we closed a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement that we effected pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement that it entered into on October 25, 2021 with an institutional investor and received gross proceeds of $11.55 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we issued to the investor (A) in a registered direct offering (i) 975,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 2,189,384 shares of Common Stock and (B) in a concurrent private placement, Series A warrants to purchase up to 1,898,630 shares of Common Stock.
Human Capital

Employees

  We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. As of December 31, 2021, SGB directly employed eighteen full-time employees and engaged outside professional firms and subcontractors to deliver projects to customers, and SG Echo directly employed sixty-nine full-time employees.
Health and Safety
 The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include: 
 ·         Adding work from home flexibility;
 ·         Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
 ·         Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
 ·         Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
