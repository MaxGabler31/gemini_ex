The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. Certain predecessor businesses which now constitute the Company's operations have been in business since 1949.

See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information about our business as well as information about our geographic operations.

Accelerating the Customer Experience
The Company's multi-year business strategy is focused on Accelerating our Customers Experience (“ACE”). The ACE initiative, which guides our actions across the business, and specifically in our customer end-to-end purchase, service, and delivery experience, has at its core building of customer loyalty and trust by addressing unique customer needs through a responsive and tailored sales, product, and service experience. We build customer loyalty and trust through personalized and high touch customer interactions that often feature strong one to one relationships. The Company's digital and multi-channel sales model drives customer acquisition and with rigorous vetting we are able to identify opportunities for product category expansion, particularly private brand products. Category expansion with our customers drives repeat orders and increases their annual and average spend. We maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty by coupling close customer relationships with product expertise, efficient and competitive fulfillment and delivery and exceptional customer service. 
WE CAN SUPPLY THAT®
Products
Our broad product offering and focus on responsiveness to our customers is captured in our promise “We Can Supply That®”. We offer our customers a competitive assortment of leading products and services, a sales force with deep product knowledge and expertise, and timely and relative industry and product content via The Knowledge Center. Our go to market strategy also focuses on leveraging our deep product knowledge and experience by seeking to expand our higher margin private brand line of Global products by adding additional products and product categories. We have over one million brand name and private brand products available through our e-commerce sites and have access to over 1.7 million products in our database. We endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers, and periodically remove certain products from our offering to improve efficiencies or to address vendor or market changes. Sourcing hard to find or non-standard product helps to differentiate our business from our competitors and we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. 
The Company has focused on offering competitive pricing, high service levels, broad and deep product offering, extensive product and sales expertise, and most importantly a private brand offering that provides high quality with an attractive price point. Products generally are categorized within the following categories: storage and shelving, safety and security, carts and trucks, HVAC and fans, furniture and decor, material handling, janitorial and facility maintenance, workbenches and shop desks, tools and instruments, plumbing and pumps, office and school supplies, packaging and shipping, lighting and electrical, food service and retail, medical and laboratory, motors and power transmission, building supplies, machining, fasteners and hardware, vehicle maintenance, and raw materials. We have become a destination and trusted supplier of these products and continue to evaluate expansion within key end markets. 
Sales and Marketing
We market our products primarily to business customers, which include for-profit businesses, state, local, and private educational organizations and government entities including federal, state, and local municipalities. We have an established multi-faceted direct marketing system and customer life cycle marketing program which tends to begin with customer acquisition via keyword or branding search, supported by strategic account managers, leading e-commerce and account management tools, and deep pre and post sales product expertise which are intended to drive customer retention and penetration and to maximize sales. We continuously evaluate and adjust our marketing spend as well as the organization of our selling resources in order to best service our existing customers, as well as to optimize customer acquisition. 
Relationship Marketers
Our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a Global Industrial account manager. Our sales force is made up of wide range of broad based and specialized account managers including dedicated Public Sector Account Managers focusing on government, education, and other municipal customers, Commercial Account Managers focusing on business customers generally organized by end market or geography and Strategic Account Managers focusing on our most complex enterprise accounts. The sales force is supported by Business Development Representatives, Territory Sales Managers, and other Subject Matter Experts who support the end to end customer life cycle management. The goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers. With access to the records we maintain, our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values. We also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange (“EDI”) ordering and customized billing services, customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers. Our relationship marketers’ efforts are supported by e-mail campaigns and periodic catalog mailings, both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales, and visits to our interactive websites, which allow customers to purchase products directly online. We believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business, educational and government customer base. We believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet-related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales; just as we believe email campaigns, and to a lesser extent catalog mailings, which feature our websites results in greater internet-related sales.
E-commerce
We currently operate multiple e-commerce sites, including:


www.globalindustrial.com 
www.globalindustrial.ca 
www.industrialsupplies.com


We are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites in our significant markets. In 2020 we enhanced our website for full ADA/508 compliance, expanded customer self service functions such as SMS notifications, added proactive notifications through Global Assist (order tracking on the web) and added the ability to create quotes and product reviews. In addition we have upgraded the look and functionality of our mobile site. In 2021, we launched a new search engine as well as reorganizing the full category hierarchy and taxonomy of our product offering in an effort to drive improved search, conversion rates, and overall user experience.
Our internet sites feature over one million MRO and industrial and general business supplies. Our customers have around-the-clock, online access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers’ interests. 
In addition to our own e-commerce websites, we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide “click-throughs” from their sites directly to ours. These arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost.
