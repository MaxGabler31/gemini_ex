Item 1. Business 
Business Overview
 
Freedom Leaf Inc. (the “Company”) is a hemp consumer packaged goods company engaged in the development and commercialization of a portfolio of brands that market and sell responsibly produced cannabinoid-rich products for health and well-being. The Company competes in the growth segments of the hemp industry as a one-stop shop supplier for major retailers and distributors. From traditional retail to e-commerce, from direct-to-consumer to medical, the Company has commercialized hemp CBD across multiple channels. The Company’s portfolio of products is robust, with competitive offerings in the tincture, softgel, gummy, sparkling water, vapeable, and topical segments. Products are marketed through direct-to-store sales and direct-to-consumer models and are supported by distribution partnerships at the regional, national, and international levels.
 
The Company’s products are differentiated from our competitors by: (a) rigorous testing and quality control; (b) premium branding and packaging; (c) white-glove treatment for consumers and businesses; and (d) informative, educational web content. The Company’s target market is health-conscious consumers who are becoming more interested in and better educated on plant-based wellness alternatives. This growing segment of the population is driven to pursue a healthier lifestyle, and the Company believes that a worldwide acceleration of consumer awareness with respect to hemp and CBD products uniquely positions Freedom Leaf to capitalize on this change in consumer sentiment. The Company’s goal is to become the world’s leading hemp consumer packaged goods company. Over the past several years, the Company has built the foundation for growth, and is poised to take full advantage of the hemp CBD market opportunity.
 
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on February 21, 2013, under the name of Arkadia International. On November 6, 2014, the Company merged with Freedom Leaf Inc., a private Nevada corporation, and the Company changed its name to Freedom Leaf Inc.
 
On May 31, 2019, the Company closed the acquisition of Dallas, Texas-based ECS Labs LLC (the “Acquisition”), including its two-wholly owned operating subsidiaries, B&B Labs, LLC, and Texas Wellness Center, LLC, which constitute the “Green Lotus” premium hemp CBD products brand (collectively “Green Lotus”). As part of the transaction, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) named Carlos Frias, the founder and CEO of Green Lotus, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
 
The new senior management team and all corporate functions, including accounting and finance, sales and marketing are now domiciled at Green Lotus’ headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Upon the closing of the Acquisition and in conjunction with announcement that the finance team would be relocated from Las Vegas to Green Lotus’ Dallas, Texas headquarters, Larry Ruhe, the Company’s former CFO, resigned. Mr. Ruhe’s duties were assumed on an interim basis by Mr. John Kalkanian, who began serving as the Company’s CFO at closing. An extensive search for a new Dallas, Texas-based CFO was conducted, and in September of 2019, the Company hired Brian Moon, who has over 30 years of accounting and CFO experience, as its CFO.
 
Mr. Daniel Nguyen, former partner in acquired Green Lotus, serves as Chief Science Officer of the Company and oversee R&D and production.
 
The Company is an audited and reporting publicly traded company under the symbol (OTCQB:FRLF) with corporate headquarters located at 3939 Beltline Rd., Suite 350, Addison, Texas.
 
The Company’s Mission
 
The Company’s mission is to improve the wellbeing of individuals and communities by providing access to natural, organic hemp oil products, and to drive awareness of the benefits of hemp oil by crafting informative and educational content for consumers.
The Company’s Market Opportunity
 
The Company’s long-term objective is to become the leading global hemp consumer packaged goods company. The Company believes that all the necessary components and capabilities are in place to accomplish this objective. The Company intends to achieve this goal by driving organic growth supported by a diverse product portfolio of healthy and functional lifestyle products in leading product categories across all distribution channels through an aligned network of retailers and distribution partners.

We believe that the hemp CBD industry has the potential to disrupt the pharmaceutical, alcohol, tobacco, textile, and food and beverages sectors. Traditional consumer packaged companies recognize the rapid adoption of cannabis products and have responded by forming partnerships and or have made investments in some of the leading cannabis players in North America. We are already witnessing this phenomenon in the beer industry. It is no coincidence that the first non-cannabis consumer packaged goods companies to make major investments in the sector were beer manufacturers, with Constellation Brands leading the way with its $4.0 billion investment in Canadian-based Canopy Growth Corp. in 2018. This was followed by AB InBev’s investment in a joint venture with Tilray to research cannabis-infused drinks for the Canadian market, and Molson Coors Canada’s joint venture agreement with Hydropothecary Corp. to develop non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages. Big tobacco has joined with Altria Group, Inc.’s $1.8 billion investment in Canadian-based Cronos Group, Inc.
 
Food and beverages that contain vitamins and other additives and ingredients to enhance health and well-being will see increased competition from products containing cannabinoids including CBD. For example, we believe that many consumers will replace traditional sports or energy drinks with cannabinoid-enhanced beverages. As an example of our ability to meet the anticipated demand for the aforementioned beverages, Green Lotus released a suite of hemp CBD carbonated beverages in Q1 of fiscal 2020.
 
The Company’s Growth Strategies
 

o | Rebranding and creating a leading consumer packaged goods company
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Partnering with established distributors and retailers
--+-------------------------------------------------------


o | Focus on operational excellence and product quality
--+----------------------------------------------------


o | Establish greater transparency and higher level of communication with the capital markets
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | New strategic plan and corporate restructuring
--+-----------------------------------------------

Rebranding and Creating a Leading Consumer Packaged Goods Company. The Company is building a robust hemp CBD consumer packaged goods platform with industry-leading brands in the U.S. and Mexico. These are early days in the development of the hemp CBD sector, and the Company believes that firms that can scale, develop strong distribution networks, and offer high-quality brands will emerge as the industry leaders. The Company is in the final stages of a planned rebranding, which will include a new holding company name, stock symbol, and a marketing and e-commerce plan that will reflect a “house of brands” strategy, providing the Company with a more effective platform to organically develop or acquire additional brands to further our growth. The Company will also leverage first-mover advantage to fully penetrate the Mexican market.
 
Partnering with established distributors and retailers. As the industry evolves, the distribution of hemp products has increasingly mirrored the distribution of wellness and other consumer packaged goods. To efficiently and rapidly increase our scale, the Company has formed partnerships with established distributors and leading regional and national retailers to expand our domestic footprint. Through these partnerships and an aggressive marketing outreach, the Company has gained traction with some of the largest distributors in the United States and is in advanced talks to partner with leading traditional retailers and state-licensed cannabis players. In addition, as an example, the Company is supporting its omnichannel selling approach throughout North America in the following ways:
 

o | Retail – scale internal sales force while securing deals with established distributors to reach growth segments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | E-Commerce – the Company is augmenting its internal team and working with media, analytics, and public relations firms who specialize in cannabis to enhance our brand awareness and drive online sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Medical – establish brand credibility through partnerships with companies collecting patient data and medical practitioners, including participation in prospective clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Focus on operational excellence and product quality. To support the Company’s robust sales pipeline in the United States and Mexico, the Company has made strategic investments in operations, including supply chain, manufacturing capabilities, product development, research and development, and multi-channel distribution. In doing so, the Company has developed a quality management system that enables it to meet the requirements of the regulatory agencies in the markets where the Company exports products, while consistently delivering high-quality and compliant products in all jurisdictions in which we operate.
 
Establish greater transparency and higher level of communication with the capital markets. In Q3 of fiscal 2019, the Company hired KCSA, a leading investor relations and public relations firm in the cannabis space, to assist in communications and to support the underserved and much needed investor relations functions at the Company. The Company intends to aggressively market its story to both investors and retail consumers.
 
Strategic Plan & Corporate Restructuring. Following the Acquisition of Green Lotus, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved a strategic plan with the following objectives: (a) to transform the Company into a leading consumer packaged goods hemp CBD company with a concentration on the Green Lotus and IrieCBD brands in the United States and Mexico, rather than building a vertically-integrated hemp company in the U.S. and Europe; (b) sell or shut down non-core and non-accretive business segments; (c) consolidate the Company’s manufacturing, sales, distribution and corporate functions into the newly acquired Green Lotus infrastructure, resulting in operational synergies and cost savings; and (d) formulate a comprehensive corporate rebranding plan for the Company.

The following actions have been executed or are underway as part of the Company’s Board-approved strategic review and restructuring plan:
 

o | IrieCBD Operations: Immediately following the Acquisition, all IrieCBD manufacturing and distribution operations in Oakland, California, were transitioned to Green Lotus’ facilities in Dallas, Texas. IrieCBD has already begun realizing the benefit of Green Lotus’ experienced internal sales team, gaining access to multiple medium-to-large accounts throughout the U.S. Staff redundancies have been addressed, and full staff integration was completed in Q4 of fiscal 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leafceuticals Europe: The Company exercised its option to terminate its Spanish greenhouse lease in May 2019, eliminating its remaining $4.3 million of payment obligations. In 2018, Leafceuticals Europe S.L.U. (“Europe”), a subsidiary of the Company, purchased a 430,000 sq. ft. indoor grow facility located in Valencia, Spain. Consistent with the Company’s plan to more efficiently leverage resources and focus capital on building its family of brands in North America, as of June 2019, all operations of Leafceuticals Europe ceased.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Tierra Science Global: Tierra Science Global, LLC (“Tierra”) was acquired in 2018 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Tierra offers health care supplements and wellness products through direct sales teams in Asia, Europe, and North America. Tierra was sold back to its original owners in July 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Hempology: To focus on the Company’s core brands, the Company sold Hempology to San Francisco Distribution Company. The Hempology brand was developed internally. Its portfolio included organic herbal vapeables, tinctures, topicals, and edibles, with a focus on all-natural and locally sourced ingredients. The Board determined that further investment in Hempology was unnecessary given the line of organic products offered by Green Lotus.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leafceuticals Inc. (US): Because the Company is not pursuing a strategy of developing a fully integrated processing and extraction capability, the Board determined that Leaufceuticals is a non-core asset. Accordingly, the Company has sold all extraction equipment domiciled in its Las Vegas facility and will be out of the space by the end of calendar 2019. Leafceuticals is the Company’s wholly owned extraction and processing division, with a manufacturing facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Leafceuticals Inc. is the holder of a Nevada Department of Agriculture Hemp Handler’s License, allowing for the legal extraction and processing of industrial hemp cannabinoids.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Cicero Transact Group, LLC and Cicero Platform, LLC: The Company’s stake in Cicero was sold to Sinclair Inc. effective June 27, 2019. In 2018, the Company purchased a minority stake in: (1) Cicero Transact Group, LLC, an online business-to-business deal platform, and (2) Cicero Platform Group LLC, a crypto-focused company. The Board determined this was a non-core asset. The Company’s stake in both Cicero entities was sold for $145,000 in July of 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Accuvape: Acquired by the Company in November 2018 as part of its vertical integration initiative, Accuvape, Inc. served as a consumer hardware company compatible with the Company’s Hempology vape cartridges. Accuvape is a non-core asset. On October 10, 2019, the Company and the former owner entered into a settlement agreement regarding the disposition of Accuvape. The agreement requires the Company to deposit up to $10,000 into the account of Accuvape for payment of business expenses, pay the net sums of $8,000 to the former owner and $4,000 to another Accuvape employee as severance of their employment with the Company, and issue a note payable of $42,000 to the former owner bearing interest at 12% per annum if not paid in full by November 15, 2019. The Company additionally assumed vendor obligations totaling a minimum of $35,830. Additional obligations relating to a lease termination are required to be paid by the Company; the cost of these obligations is not expected to be material.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Plants to Paper LLC: The Board determined that Plants to Paper is a non-core asset, and the Company is engaged in discussions with the owners to sell back its minority stake. The Company owns 25% of Plants to Paper LLC. Plants to Paper LLC holds a provisional patent for the first organic, toxin-free hemp “wraps” to replace chemically treated paper for smoking.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Media Properties: FreedomLeaf.com is the online website for the Company’s print publication, “Freedom Leaf Magazine.” The Board has determined that this publication is inconsistent with the Company’s strategy of developing leading consumer product brands and is a non-core asset. The Company is engaged in discussions with several interested parties, and the Company expects a sale of these properties by the end of Q4 of fiscal 2020.

The Company’s Consumer Product Brands
 
Green Lotus™ Hemp (“Green Lotus™”) is a rapidly growing premium hemp oil products brand that manufactures and distributes premium cannabinoid products including tinctures, gel caps, edibles, topicals, vape cartridges, and beverages made from organic industrial hemp. Green Lotus™ has grown rapidly since its inception in 2016 and now has a national presence in over 1,200 locations in the U.S. and is a first mover in the Mexican CBD market, with 4,000 points of initial distribution.

IrieCBD (“Irie”) – Founded in 2014, Irie’s mission is to provide full-spectrum, natural solutions for health and wellness. Irie is a premium-priced hemp brand, distributing full-spectrum hemp CBD tinctures, edibles, topicals and capsules to over 300 high-end retailers and health and wellness chains in the United States and abroad.
 
The Company’s Capabilities 
 
Supply Chain: Over the past several years, the Company has been developing and solidifying its national supply chain relationships in recognition that the industry would become more competitive and increasingly consolidated. The Company has structured mutually beneficial relationships with its dry goods and packaging suppliers, developed a pipeline of premium hemp biomass with cultivators in Colorado and Oregon, and invested in its internal production and manufacturing teams, as well as its strategic contract manufacturing partners.
 
Processing and Extraction: The Company purchases biomass directly from cultivators on the spot market and through futures contracts. The Company does not own land or grow its own hemp. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the Company believes that the number of acres dedicated to hemp cultivation will increase dramatically, leading to more supply and lower prices for isolates and extract, which is currently the case. The Company maintains a tolling arrangement with Mile High Labs in Colorado, who produces the Company’s raw extract, which the Company then further refines and processes in its facilities.
Lab Capabilities: The Company’s Dallas, Texas lab is managed by Chief Science Officer Daniel Nguyen, who has 19 years of experience in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, compounding and manufacturing. Mr. Nguyen manages an experienced team of R&D and product development specialists who have extensive experience in product creation and nutraceutical manufacturing.
Manufacturing: In addition to the Company’s 10,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas, which is utilized primarily to produce tinctures for the Green Lotus and IrieCBD brands, the Company works with an additional eight contract manufacturers across the United States. These additional manufacturers have expertise in specific product lines, allowing for product specialization and reducing the need for the Company to invest in costly production and manufacturing facilities.
Sales & Marketing: As a result of the Green Lotus acquisition, the Company has acquired a highly skilled and experienced internal sales, account management, and merchandising team numbering 16 professionals. This team focuses on new account sales, account retention, education, and customer service. Each team member touches an average of approximately 100 accounts per day. Now, with a broader product line, the Company’s sales team can expand its reach. Senior members of the revenue team focus on large accounts and face-to-face account management, as well as acting as brand ambassadors at leading industry trade shows to generate sales leads. Each sales team member has individual targets for increasing “base” volume through distribution expansion and “incremental” volume through promotions and other in-store merchandising and display activity. Compensation is variable and performance based.
 
The Company markets its hemp products using a content strategy focused on high-value education distributed through a range of marketing mediums, including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, events, and sponsorships, digital marketing and social media, direct marketing, and traditional media including print, radio, outdoor, and TV.
 
Distribution: The Company wholesales its brands through a network of approximately 10 distributors nationwide. In fiscal Q3 2019, the Company finalized a one-year distribution agreement with Greenlane Holdings (ticker GNLN), the leading wholesaler for premium cannabis and CBD products, serving approximately 11,000 vape and head shops nationwide. Green Lotus currently distributes its products to approximately 1,000 vape and head shops, and this new partnership will significantly expand the Company’s nationwide reach and sales potential.
 
The Company is in advanced discussions with several leading grocery, convenience and specialty food store distributors in the U.S., as well as several large national and regional grocery and specialty food operators, and non-grocery retail operators. The Company is confident that it will close one or more of these potential distribution contracts over the next twelve months.
 
E-Commerce Platform: The Company has historically targeted the B2B market, and the Company believes there is significant untapped potential in fully developing its e-commerce capabilities, which is a top priority. Direct-to-consumer e-commerce revenue represents approximately 10% of consolidated revenue, with 75% of total e-commerce revenue generated by the IrieCBD brand. Currently, Green Lotus generates a de minimis amount of revenue through its e-commerce channel.
 
By fiscal year-end 2020, the Company expects to more than double its e-commerce revenue on a monthly basis. This untapped potential represents a significant opportunity and major area of focus for the Company, as direct-to-consumer sales generate much higher margins than are available through wholesale channels.

Websites/Media: The Company’s customer-facing websites include GreenLotusHemp.com, FreedomLeaf.com, IrieCBD.com, and LaMarihuana.com. These websites offer brand-specific products directly to consumers and provide product and cannabinoid education, which is an important element of the Company’s marketing strategy.
 
LaMarihuana.com, the largest Spanish language cannabis website in the world, is currently underutilized from an advertising revenue standpoint. The Company sees significant opportunities to drive consumers to the Green Lotus and IrieCBD e-commerce platforms through links and banner ads, as well as to display promotions for the Company’s full line of CBD products. The Company is in the process of finalizing a strategy to fully monetize this asset in partnership with CBD Life SA. The Company expects to implement its new strategy beginning in Q2 of fiscal 2020.
 
Key Strategic Partner – CBD Life SA
 
The Company completed its inaugural shipment of $600,000 of topical hemp CBD products to Mexico on July 31, 2019, with an additional $1.2 million in topical products shipped in fiscal Q3 2019. These products will be distributed by Green Lotus' partner in Mexico, CBD Life SA, in up to 4,000 locations initially and expanding to upwards of 40,000 locations by the end of 2020.
 
This shipment represents the first-ever commercial order of hemp CBD retail products in Mexico through regular distribution channels. The initial shipment included three topical SKUs labeled as “Heat,” “Freeze,” and “Salve.” Product labels read, "Manufactured by Green Lotus." The Company has an exclusive contractual relationship with CBD Life SA that extends through March 2021, and the Company is engaged in discussions to extend the contractual relationship well beyond 2021. All Mexican import licenses are registered in the name of Green Lotus and CBD Life SA.
 
The Company is a first mover in the Mexican market, and Green Lotus is set to expand its catalog of products, with $26 million in purchase orders from CBD Life SA for tinctures, gel caps, edibles, and beverages, which the Company began shipping on July 31, 2019.
 
Over the past three years, Green Lotus has worked closely with CBD Life SA and the Mexican government to obtain the necessary permits and meet the appropriate regulatory requirements to reach this milestone. Obtaining these permits was a difficult, time-consuming process. The Company believes that the challenges inherent in meeting regulatory requirements represent a significant barrier to entry for its competitors, translating to a strategic advantage for the Company.
 
The Endocannabinoid System and Benefits of CBD
 
Discovered in the early 1990s, the endocannabinoid system (“ECS”) is an internal regulatory system that maintains homeostasis in human and animal physiology. The endocannabinoid system consists of molecules produced by the human body and are found at almost every pain pathway from nerves and immune cells to the spinal cord and brain. Endocannabinoid receptors allow endocannabinoids – like CBD – to bind and signal to the body’s ECS to address any bodily functions that are out of balance. The ECS helps regulate a variety of functions in the body, both physiological and cognitive, including appetite, mood, inflammatory responses, stress response, memory, and pain.
 
The plant Cannabis sativa L. contains over 113 phytocannabinoids, with two most prevalent being THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). Unlike THC, CBD is non-intoxicating. CBD isolate contains no THC, while full-spectrum hemp oil, a whole-plant extract, has trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%).
 
Given the current legal status of cannabis and the recent legalization of hemp, there have been limited studies and clinical trials that measure the benefits and risks associated with the use of CBD. To date, the FDA has approved one drug, Epidiolex, of which CBD is a primary constituent. Manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals, Epidiolex is effective in treating rare forms of epilepsy. There is a tremendous amount of anecdotal evidence on the positive benefits of CBD, which the Company believes is used by consumers to address a range of health and wellness issues, including chronic pain, inflammation, arthritis, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and acne, to name a few.
 
The Hemp CBD Market Opportunity
 
In the wake of the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the interest in and demand for hemp-derived CBD consumer products has exploded. In 2018, the CBD market in the U.S. is estimated to have generated revenue of approximately $600 million to $2.0 billion. Today, hemp products are sold in the U.S. through multiple distribution channels, including online at Amazon and direct from manufacturers, leading national and regional drug chains (including CVS), grocery stores, natural and health stores, smoke and head shops, department stores and malls. In a proprietary consumer survey, Cowen & Co. found that in January 2019 close to 7% of respondents indicated that they used CBD as a supplement, indicating significant upside potential as consumer awareness increases.

-

 

A Gallup poll released in June 2019 indicated that nearly two in three Americans have some familiarity with CBD oils, and that includes 14% who say they are very familiar, 33% somewhat familiar and 17% not too familiar. And 4 in 10 Americans think CBD oils should be legally available for adults as an over-the-counter purchase, while another 21% think people should be able to buy them with a doctor’s prescription. Confidence in CBD is also much greater the more people know about it – 64% of those who say they are very familiar with CBD believe it has significant health benefits.
 
According to the Brightfield Group, approximately 80% of CBD consumers use the products at least once a week and more than one third of users do so daily. A recent study published by the U.S. National Library of Medicine found that 62% of CBD users were attempting to treat an existing medical condition. And a study performed by Brightfield Group and HelloMD found that 50%+ of respondents indicated that hemp CBD relieved their medical conditions “more effectively or much more effectively” than over-the-counter products. What this data indicates is that a large number of CBD consumers use the product frequently, find that hemp CBD ameliorates a variety of medical conditions, and are replacing over-the-counter pain medications with hemp CBD products. All of these trends bode well for the continued strong growth in the market.
 
By 2025, Cowen & Co. estimates that CBD offerings in all categories could conservatively generate $16 billion in retail sales. Canaccord Genuity, in a report released in September 2019, estimated U.S. retail sales of $18.4 billion by 2024, a 45% CAGR. To put this in perspective, spending on over-the-counter pain medications in the U.S., including Tylenol and Advil, was $18 billion in 2018 and estimated to grow to $19 billion in 2019.
 
Based on Cowen’s consumer survey, the top four retail product categories are tinctures (44%), topicals (26%), capsules, (22%), and beverages, (19%). The largest category is nutraceuticals, which includes tinctures, capsules, and gummies, followed by topicals, beverages, skin care/beauty, food, and vape products.

*Cowen’s Collective View of CBD, February 25, 2019 | | | 

 
We believe that the more educated the consumer is, the more likely he or she will try a variety of CBD products and remain loyal to a specific brand. Consumer education is a key pillar of our marketing strategy, and we work closely with our distributors and vendors to educate them on the benefits of CBD and its impact on human physiology. The Company offers a full suite of CBD products that appeal to various demographics and which the Company believes are being used by consumers to address multiple health and wellness issues.
 
Competition
 
The market for hemp-derived CBD products is highly competitive, consisting of publicly-trade and privately-owned companies, many of whom are better capitalized than the Company. The publicly listed competitors included market leader Charlotte’s Web, CV Sciences, Elixinol, Abacus, and Green Growth Brands, and private companies such as Mary’s, Papa & Barkley, Lord Jones, and Bluebird. In addition, both public and private U.S. multi-state operators and Canadian LP’s have entered the hemp-derived CBD consumer market or have announced plans to do so. The market is highly fragmented, and the vast majority of industry participants generate less than ~$2 million of annual revenue, according to the Hemp Business Journal. The Company believes that most of these small industry players will not have enough capital or will lack the manufacturing and distribution breadth to survive in the medium-to-long-term.
 
By virtue of its highly integrated supply chain and manufacturing footprint, high quality product offerings, and extensive distribution network in both the U.S. and Mexico, the Company is well-positioned to continue its rapid growth and become a leading consumer packaged goods company in the hemp CBD product market in North America.
 
U.S. Hemp Regulatory Framework
 
The cultivation of industrial hemp was first officially re-legalized in the United States through Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014, which defined industrial hemp as any Cannabis sativa L. (“hemp”) plant with less than 0.3% THC, on a dry weight basis. The legislation opened the door for state-level agricultural pilot programs in states that have legalized industrial hemp.

In 2017, the United States passed the Appropriations Act of 2017, which included a section further protecting the industrial hemp section of the Agricultural Act of 2014. A key provision of this section prevents the federal government from using any appropriations funds in contravention of Section 7606 and allows for interstate transport of industrial hemp.
 
The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, referred to as the 2018 Farm Bill (the “Farm Bill”), was signed into law on December 20, 2018. The Farm Bill removes hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, providing it contains no more than 0.3% THC on a dry-weight basis. This applies to any and all parts of the plant. The Farm Bill guarantees that hemp and hemp products can be moved from state to state and imported the same as any other crop. The Bill directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to come up with national hemp regulations “as expeditiously as practicable.”
 
In May 2019, the USDA (in a legal opinion) said that hemp can be transported across state lines – even through states that have not enacted laws allowing the crop’s production – and that the de-scheduling of the plant and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill are already in effect because they are self-executing and do not require further action by federal agencies.
 
The Farm Bill specifically notes that the FDA retains its authority over food, drugs, and cosmetics. The FDA’s position continues to be that CBD cannot be used in food or in dietary supplements because CBD is listed as “an active ingredient in a drug product,” which refers to Epidiolex, an FDA-approved treatment for rare types of epilepsy, manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals. Following the passage of the Farm Bill, the FDA announced plans to hold hearings and review the inclusion of CBD in food, drugs, and cosmetics. With the announcement of a public hearing on May 31, 2019, the FDA took its first step to establish regulatory guidelines and set up a high-level internal working group to explore pathways for CBD products to be lawfully marketed. Timing on final regulations is unclear, but a progress report is expected to be released in the fall of 2019.
 
As it did before the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA continues to monitor health claims made by CBD manufacturers. On July 23, 2019, the FDA announced that it had issued a warning letter to Curaleaf, Inc. for illegally selling unapproved products containing CBD online with unsubstantiated claims that the products treat cancer, Alzheimer’s, opioid withdrawal, pain and pet anxiety, among other conditions and diseases.
 
A recent Gallup poll found that the medicinal value of marijuana is one of the main points that supporters of broader legalization of marijuana give for their position. As awareness and use of CBD continues to increase, the Company believes there will be enormous pressure on the FDA to develop a regulatory framework to ensure that safe and effective CBD products are available to the public.
