Item 1. Business.
THE COMPANY

Global Warming Solutions, Inc. (“Company”) is an Oklahoma corporation headquartered in Temecula, CA. that develops technologies to help mitigate climate change. The Company was formerly known as Southern Investments, Inc., and was domiciled in Oklahoma.  On April 15, 2007, the company changed its name to Global Warming Solutions, Inc., and moved its headquarters to the commonwealth of Canada.  In February 2021 we relocated to Temecula, California.

The Company was incorporated on March 30, 1999, as Southern Investments, Inc. and has not been in bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding. The Company has never been classified as a shell company.  

On April 15, 2007, Southern Investments, Inc. acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Global Warming Technologies, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, in exchange for 55,000,000 shares of Southern Investments, Inc. common stock. Following the acquisition, Southern Investments, Inc. changed its name to Global Warming Solutions, Inc and the Company implemented a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding common stock that took effect on July 6, 2007.  

From 2007-2017 the Company was conducting testing of its fertilizer product made with Humate Coated Urea (HCU) with various farmers in Canada. Recently the Company has begun a pilot program in New Zealand with Carbon Company, LTD.  Originally, the Company obtained 11.8% of Carbon Company, LTD which was transferred to the Company’s CEO as compensation for work performed on behalf of the Company prior to 2018.

On October 23, 2019, the Company acquired the domain name “www.cbd.biz” and certain other intangible assets in exchange for a convertible promissory note for $100,000 and began offering hemp-based cannabinoid (“CBD”) products through this website.  

On May 8, 2021, the company ceased all operations relating to CBD sales. The website “www.cbd.biz” has since been shut down. All operations pertaining to CBD sales have been divested and discontinued. The domain and all other assets associated with CBD sales was transferred to Green Holistic Solutions, Inc., in exchange for 18 million shares of Green Holistic Solutions, Inc.  Green Holistic Solutions, Inc., is controlled by Paul Rosenberg and Michael Hawkins, both of whom are a significant shareholder of the Company.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company’s total assets are $1,042,966.  These assets are comprised primarily of $900,832 in cash, $50,548 in prepaid expenses, $287 in inventory, $6,014 in furniture and equipment, $12,328 in leasehold improvements, $11,800 in deposits, and $61,157 of intangible assets.  During the past five years, the company has generated approximately $180,000 in revenue.  We have expended approximately $164,000 in cash in support of the operations.  Excluding non-cash expenditures of amortization and accrued interest, the Company has a current positive cash flow. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued its report connection with the audit of our financial statements for the periods of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, which included an explanatory paragraph in Note 3 describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Thus far, GWSO management has relied on capital loans and equity investments for the purpose of growing the business. Without continued loans or equity investments, we will not have the necessary capital required to execute our business plan and grow our business. Management has estimated that the costs associated with implementation of its business plan over the next twelve months include, but are not limited to, payroll, consulting, marketing and general administration of $1,000,000 (which expenses will be satisfied by means other than available cash expenditure, such as, but not limited to, equity or profit-sharing arrangements) and sales.  

Management estimates that funding of $1,000,000 will be needed to implement the business plan, should revenues not be generated, which was raised through equity capital.

OUR PLAN

The Company is engaged in the business of retail sales in global warming products and solutions. We believe that our products will provide our business consumers with solutions to mitigate risks associated with global warming.  In addition to the resale component of our business, we provide consulting services in various approaches to the mitigating global warming risks and assist our clients with an execution plan for the benefit and growth of their business. 

We compete in a highly competitive market that includes other global warming companies. Our growth is reliant upon our ability to promote our business as earth stewards and attract the attention of the target market who view environmental awareness as a lifestyle.

Thus far, we have been successful in driving traffic to our websites and building a client base. Specifically, we have built a presence on leading social-media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Through these sites, we post information about our services and make daily attempts to engage our target audience. This process is designed to drive traffic to our websites and eventually leads to sales. The marketing strategy is cost-effective, and we do not anticipate any significant costs arising from this strategy.

CORPORATE INFORMATION

Our principal executive office is located at 28751 Rancho CA RD, Suite 100, Temecula, CA 92590 and our telephone number is (951) 528-2102.  Our fiscal year end is December 31 of each calendar year.
IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY

We currently qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These reduced reporting requirements include:

■ | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this report and in our future periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
■ | not being required to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or to seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.



We may continue to take advantage of these reduced reporting obligations until such time as we no longer meet the eligibility requirements. If certain events occur prior to such date, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company.

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and other matters in this report and other filings we make with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders is different than the information you might receive from other public fully reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Industry Overview

Global Warming Industry

Typically, executives manage environmental risk as a threefold problem of i) regulatory compliance, ii) potential liability for industrial accidents, and iii) pollutant release mitigation.  But climate change presents business risks that are different in kind because the impact is global, the problem is long-term, and the harm is essentially irreversible.  

The market for global warming solutions is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, resulting in a dynamic competitive environment with several dominant national and multi-national leaders. The Company will have to compete with established corporations that have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and human resource capabilities. Such competition may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive distribution policies and make more attractive offers to potential clients. The Company expects competition to persist and intensify in the future.

Management believes that there is an increasing demand for money-making ideas created by the warming of our planet and that products and services that slow the flow of greenhouse gases by using less energy or by substituting clean energy for fossil fuels are in great demand. 

Description of Business

Our current business strategy is to generate revenue through three basic options: i) consulting fees, ii) royalty fees, and iii) retail sales.  

Principal Products

Currently the company has initiated research and development on Hydrogen Fuel Cell Batteries which they expect to compete directly with the current Lithium-Ion market.

We have no government contracts at this time, nor are we seeking any.  Our retail operations will be primarily business to customer, while our consulting and royalty revenues, when earned, will be primarily, business to business.

Customers

Approximately 93% of our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, were generated from one client in the country of Hungary.  This Company represented approximately 92% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets, and Other Intellectual Property

In order to generate revenue from royalties and consulting, we have been developing technologies for future use and development.  There are no assurances any of these items currently identified as research and development will materialize or generate revenue for the Company.

We intend to file a provisional patent with the U.S. Patent Office in the first quarter of 2021 titled Hydrogen Supply Way and Device…  This patent will cover intellectual property developed by us in expanding our business opportunities as discussed under Recent Events.

We have created various formulas and processes we intend to patent and/or copyright for future use and licensing.  The following list comprise our intellectual property:

Pick-Up-Oil – is a proprietary carbon sorbent for oil collection.  Under the process, the airborne sorbent is discharged in the oil slick and after absorbing the oil is collected.  The product is then extracted from the oil and available for secondary use.  

Hybrid Electrochemical Energy System – is a patented battery system employing advanced manufacturing techniques for solid state electrolytes. With large capacity anode due to special design creating higher specific energy due to air oxygen acting as a depolarizer we expect much quicker charging times and far cheaper manufacturing costs.
Exclusive Rights License Technology

Turbine Energy Project – is a patented turbine technology invented and owned by Dr. Yuri Abramov “Licensor”, that increases the efficiency of electrical power production triggered by wind. Lift force is generated with relatively low wind force and utilizes changes in temperature and density to generate equivocal force throughout thus creating perpetual flow.  The Company has the right of the use of the patented technology on a perpetual basis. The Company will pay a 6% licensing fee until such time as $10 million has been paid to the Licensor at which time the patent shall be transferred to the Company and the Licensor shall receive an option for up to 2% of the total issued and outstanding stock. 
Growth Strategy

We anticipate growth in our operations through normal acceptance of our products, through the licensing of our technologies and intellectual properties, and through acquisitions when deemed in the best interest of our shareholders.

Competition

The Company competes with other industry participants, including those in global warming products and services.  Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Company’s control may make it more attractive for prospective customers to transact business with other entities.

Our potential competitors may have greater resources, longer histories, more developed intellectual property, and lower costs of operations. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.

Recent Events

On April 8, 2021, Mr. Michael Pollastro, 37, was appointed to the Board of Directors and President of the Company. Also, effective April 8, 2021, Mr. Vladimir Vasilenko resigned from his position on the Board of Directors and as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and appointed Chief Scientific Officer. Mr. Vasilenko’s resignation was not based on any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.

In 2021 the Company has engaged MSP Corporate, a Ukrainian patent agency to file a patent on behalf of the Company for their mobile system for the production of hydrogen and electric energy during the movement of automobiles.  We believe our system is more suitable for vehicular applications as it recovers metal sodium produced by means of circulating electrical current. The Company has no projections when this project will be complete, when or if the project will be offered on the market, or if the project will be successful.

In 2020, the Company entered into the initial phase of testing its theory for a sodium-based battery.  The study is in conjunction with a Scientific School in Kazakhstan.  The study’s focus is of electrochemical processes in biological objects.  The Company believes that the transfer rate of sodium ions in our solid electrolyte is sufficient to provide power to the vehicle.  The Company has divided the project into three phases.  The end result will be the testing of a sodium-based battery on a light chassis.  The Company has no projections when this project will be complete, when or if the project will be offered on the market, or if the project will be successful. The cost associated with this project has been minimal to date; however, we expect the initial investment to develop this will be greater than we can self-fund. We are actively seeking to raise capital through private placement exempt from registration under Rule 506(c).

In December 2020, the Company began developing and designing an ECO APP for calculating, assessing, monitoring CO2 emissions and reforestation of affected areas.  The application will use satellite imaging and other remote-sensing technologies to measure real time atmospheric CO2 being absorbed and stored by trees and other plants across the USA and Europe. The Company is still evaluating revenue potential opportunities associated with this initiative.  The Company has no projections when this project will be complete, when or if the project will be offered on the market, or if the project will be successful. 

On December 11, 2020, the Company announced it was relocating its headquarters to Temecula, California in January 2021.  In February 2021 we relocated to Temecula, California.

On December 5, 2020, the Company converted all its outstanding debt into common stock. Total debt converted was $531,203 at the conversion price of $2.13 per share.  An additional two million shares were issued to three debt holders as settlement for converting at $2.13 per share instead of $0.01 as outlined in their various debt instruments.  Under the conversions, Paul Rosenberg was issued 1,155,585 shares of common stock, Epic Industry Corp was issued 550,606 shares of common stock and Overwatch Partners, Inc., was issued 523,899 shares of common stock.

On December 3, 2020, the Company incorporated Alterna Motors, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Subsequently, Alterna Motors entered into a letter of intent with Classic Electro, LLC, based in Grodno, Belorussia.  It is in the intent of the parties for Alterna Motors to be the American and Canadian distributor of Classic Electro’s retrofitting engine concept and universal electric mobility installation kit.  The Company has no assurances at this time that this project will be implemented, that an actual agreement will be entered into, or if this project will be successful.  In addition, Alterna Motors is developing a line of three-wheeled, all electric local delivery vehicles for use in the USA and Europe.  The Company has no assurances at this time that this project will be implemented, that an actual agreement will be entered into, or if this project will be successful. The cost associated with this project has been minimal to date; however, we expect the initial investment to develop this will be greater than we can self-fund. We are actively seeking to raise capital through private placement exempt from registration under Rule 506(c). 

On November 17, 2020, the Company’s CEO cancelled 12 million shares he owned in the Company.  The CEO received no compensation for such cancellation.

On October 26, 2020, the Company established an advisory committee.  The advisory committee consists of seven members with expertise in the global warming communities.  Each member has agreed to serve on the advisory committee for 2 years. The goal of the advisory committee is to make recommendations to the company and its scientist in matters within the areas of their experience and expertise, based upon the members’ reasonable research, study, and analysis.  Compensation for serving on the advisory committee has is determined by the board of directors on an individual by individual basis based upon the experience, knowledge and negotiated value.  The advisory committee will meet three times per year.

Employees

We currently have 1 officer and director who provide all the primary research and development for future licensing and product evaluations. Our management team currently has no agreement with the Company and works on an as needed basis.  We assume as the requirements grow, future commitments from our officers will be obtained. Current management is believed to have been compensated at below market levels during the past five years.  

All other services required by the Company are managed through consultants on an as needed basis.
