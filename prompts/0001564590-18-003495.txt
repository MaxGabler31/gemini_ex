Item 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 US Foods Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “US Foods”. US Foods conducts all of its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary US Foods, Inc. (“USF”). 
 Our Company
 We are among America’s great food companies and one of only two foodservice distributors with a national footprint in the United States. Built through organic growth and acquisitions, we trace our roots back over 150 years to a number of heritage companies with rich legacies in food innovation and customer service. These include Monarch Foods (established in 1853), Sexton (1883), PYA (1903), Rykoff (1911) and Kraft Foodservice (1976). US Foodservice was organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1989. In November 2011, we rebranded from “US Foodservice” to “US Foods.” 
 The U.S. foodservice distribution industry is large, fragmented and growing, with total industry sales of approximately $290 billion in 2017 according to Technomic (January 2018), a third-party source for food and foodservice industry data, intelligence and commentary. With net sales of $24 billion in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, we are the second largest foodservice distributor in the United States by annual sales, with a 2017 market share of approximately 8%.
 Our mission is to be First In Food. We strive to inspire and empower chefs and foodservice operators to bring great food experiences to consumers. This mission is supported by our strategy of Great Food. Made Easy. which centers on providing our customers a broad and innovative offering of high-quality products, as well as a comprehensive suite of industry-leading e-commerce, technology, and business solutions. We operate as one business with standardized business processes, shared systems infrastructure, and an organizational model that optimizes national scale with local execution, allowing us to manage the business as a single operating segment. We have centralized activities where scale matters and our local field structure focuses on customer facing activities.  As we say on our trucks, we are Keeping Kitchens Cooking across America.
 
   We supply approximately 250,000 customer locations nationwide. These customer locations include independently owned single and multi-unit restaurants, regional restaurant concepts, national restaurant chains, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels, country clubs, government and military organizations, colleges and universities, and retail locations. We provide approximately 350,000 fresh, frozen, and dry food stock-keeping units, or SKUs, as well as non-food items, sourced from approximately 5,000 suppliers. Approximately 4,000 sales associates manage customer relationships at local, regional, and national levels. They are supported by sophisticated marketing and category management capabilities, as well as a sales support team that includes world-class chefs and restaurant operations consultants. Our extensive network of over 60 distribution facilities and fleet of approximately 6,000 trucks allow us to operate efficiently and provide high levels of customer service. This operating model allows us to leverage our nationwide scale and footprint while executing locally. 
 Our Business Strategy
 While we serve all customer types, our strategy focuses on independent restaurants, small and regional chains, and healthcare and hospitality customers. Among other factors, their expected growth, mix of product and category purchases, and adoption of value-added solutions make them attractive to us.
 We offer innovative products and services that help chefs and operators succeed. Our e-commerce tools and mobile solutions make it easier for customers to do business with us. We execute on these elements of our strategy while delivering on the fundamental requirements that are important to all of our customers. 
 Growth from acquisitions remains an important part of our strategy.  In fiscal year 2017, we completed five acquisitions, including three broadline foodservice distributors and two specialty distributors.  We believe there remain attractive acquisition opportunities for us that will allow us to grow with our target customer types and generate an attractive return on investment from the synergies we capture from integration.

Our Industry
 The U.S. foodservice distribution industry has a large number of companies competing in the space, including local, regional, and national distributors. Foodservice distributors typically fall into three categories, representing differences in customer focus, product offering, and supply chain:

• | Broadline distributors who offer a “broad line” of products and services
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | System distributors who carry products specified for large chains
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialized distributors focused on specific product categories or customer types (e.g., meat or produce)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A number of adjacent competitors also serve the U.S. foodservice distribution industry, including cash-and-carry retailers, commercial wholesale outlets and warehouse clubs, commercial website outlets, and grocery stores. 
 There is a high degree of customer overlap, particularly across the broadline, specialized and cash-and-carry categories, as many customers purchase from multiple distributors. Most buying decisions are based on the type of product offered, quality and price, and a distributor’s ability to completely and accurately fill orders and provide timely deliveries. Since switching costs are low, customers can make supplier and distribution channel changes quickly. Existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers. Given our mix of products and services, we consider ourselves a broadline distributor. 
 The U.S. foodservice distribution industry is comprised of different customer types of varying sizes, growth profiles, and product and service requirements. 
  
• | Independent restaurants/small chains and regional chains. Independent restaurants, and small and regional chains typically differentiate themselves in the market based on the dining experience they provide to consumers and the quality and diversity of their menu. They value business solutions that help them attract diners, improve the effectiveness of their menu offering, and drive efficiency in their operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Healthcare customers. Healthcare customers generally fall into either acute care (e.g., hospital systems) or senior living (e.g., nursing homes and long-term care facilities). Healthcare customers have complex foodservice needs given their scale, need for menu diversity, and logistics considerations. Food is also not as central to their overall business as it is for a restaurant, but it is a key contributor to patient satisfaction. As a result, some healthcare providers utilize third-party contract management companies to operate their foodservice facilities. Many use group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, as intermediaries in order to gain procurement scale. In our experience, healthcare customers purchasing directly, through GPOs, or through contract foodservice operators value strong relationships with their foodservice partners, particularly those that bring national scale, a broad product offering, and strong transactional and logistics capabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospitality customers. Hospitality customers are diverse group, ranging from large hotel chains and conference centers to local banquet halls, country clubs, casinos, and entertainment and sports complexes. Food is a key contributor to guest satisfaction for these customers, and they value solutions related to menu planning and efficiency improvements in their kitchens and restaurants. With complex foodservice needs, hospitality customers value streamlined purchasing processes and expect high service levels in fulfilling their orders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National restaurant chains. National chains tend to in-source most activities except distribution, where they often rely on system distributors primarily for freight and logistics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In fiscal year 2017, no single customer represented more than 3% of our total customer sales. Sales to our top 50 customers/GPOs represented approximately 43% of our net sales in fiscal year 2017. We have relationships with GPOs that act as agents for their members in negotiating pricing, delivery and other terms. Some customers who are members of GPOs purchase their products directly from us under the terms negotiated by their GPOs. In fiscal year 
 3

2017, this accounted for about 25% of our total customer purchases. GPOs primarily focus on healthcare, hospitality, education, government/military and restaurant chains.
 We believe that a broad array of value-added solutions offered by foodservice distributors makes customers more effective and efficient and can help foodservice distributors profitably grow their businesses. These services require distributors to invest in their capabilities, resulting in a higher cost-to-serve. When customers benefit from product and service solutions, they purchase a more attractive and profitable mix of items and tend to have stronger commercial relationships and loyalty.
 We believe that the customer types that we target, which include independent restaurants, small and regional chains, and healthcare and hospitality customers, have greater growth prospects and/or benefit from the types of  value-added solutions we offer to a greater extent than other customer types. 
 There are several important dynamics affecting the industry.
  
• | Evolving consumer tastes and preferences. Consumers demand healthy and authentic food alternatives with fewer artificial ingredients, and they value locally harvested and sustainably manufactured products. In addition, many ethnic food offerings are becoming more mainstream as consumers show a greater willingness to try new flavors and cuisines. Changes in consumer preferences create opportunities for new and innovative products and for unique food-away-from-home destinations. This, in turn, is expected to create growth, margin expansion, and better customer retention opportunities for those distributors with the flexibility to balance national scale and local preferences. We believe foodservice distributors will likely need broader product assortments, extended supplier networks, effective supply chain management capabilities, and strong food safety programs to meet these needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Generational shifts with millennials and baby boomers. Given their purchasing power, millennials and baby boomers will continue to significantly influence food consumption and the food-away-from-home market. According to a U.S. Census Bureau survey, there were 83 million individuals born between 1982 and 2000 in the United States. That makes these millennials the largest demographic cohort. They are key to driving growth in the broader U.S. food industry as their disposable income increases. Baby boomers continue to shape the industry as they remain in the workplace longer, which is expected to prolong their contribution to food-away-from-home expenditures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing importance of e-commerce. We see significant future growth in e-commerce and in the adoption of mobile technology solutions by foodservice operators. E-commerce solutions increase customer retention. They also deepen the relationship between foodservice distributors and customers, creating new insights and services that can make both more efficient. We think deeper, technology-enabled relationships with customers will accelerate the adoption of new products and increase customer loyalty. As a result, distributors that have invested in creating these capabilities have a competitive edge. We believe this trend will accelerate, as millennials become key influencers and decision-makers within the industry, particularly at the customer level. We believe foodservice distributors will need to strengthen technology, data analytics, and related capabilities to address these changes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we have the scale, foresight and agility required to proactively address these trends and, in turn, benefit from higher growth, greater customer retention and improved profitability.

 We have a broad assortment of product categories and brands to meet customers’ needs. In many categories, we offer products under a spectrum of private brands, based on price and quality.

 Our business does not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and as a result, is not considered seasonal. 
 Working Capital
 Our operations and strategic objectives require continuing capital investment, and our resources include cash provided by operations, as well as access to capital from bank borrowings, various types of debt and other financing arrangements.

Government Regulation
 As a marketer and distributor of food products in the United States, US Foods must comply with various laws and regulations from federal, state and local regulatory agencies. A summary of certain laws and regulations is described below.
Food Holding and Processing
 We are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Bioterrorism Act; and regulations created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the format and content of certain information that must appear on food product labels.
 The published applicable rules under the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) significantly expanded our food safety requirements. Among other things, we are required to maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated, including new standards for maintaining the safety of food during transportation. FSMA further regulates food products imported into the United States and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. 
 For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Country of Origin Labeling Act, and regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The USDA imposes standards for food safety, product quality and sanitation, including the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products, and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our vendors.
 Our Company and products are also subject to state and local regulation. This includes measures such as the licensing of our facilities, enforcement of standards for our products and facilities by state and local health agencies, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling products.
 Our distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We have a small number of processing facilities for some meat, poultry, seafood and produce products.  These units are appropriately registered and inspected by the USDA (meat and poultry) and the FDA (produce and seafood), respectively.  We also must establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.
 Our customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.
 Trade
 For the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside of the United States, and for the shipment of products to customers located outside of the United States, we are subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Our activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
Anticorruption
 Because we are organized under the laws of a state in the U.S. and our principal place of business is in the U.S., we are considered a “domestic concern” under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA“) and are covered by the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any domestic concern and any officer, director, employee, or agent, acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to (i) influence any act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a 
 6

foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining or retaining business, or directing business to another person.
 Ground Transportation
 The U.S. Department of Transportation and its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Matters such as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations.
Environmental
 Our operations are also subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as zoning and building regulations. Environmental laws and regulations cover a variety of procedures, including appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; complying with clean air laws, including those governing vehicle emissions; properly handling and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases; and monitoring and maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products.
Employment
 The U.S. Department of Labor and its agencies, the Employee Benefits Security Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulate our employment practices and standards for workers. We are also subject to laws that prohibit discrimination in employment based on non-merit categories, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws relating to accessibility and the removal of barriers. Our workers’ compensation self-insurance is subject to regulation by the jurisdictions in which we operate.
 Our facilities are subject to inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act with respect to our compliance with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. US Foods is also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace.
 Employees 
 As of December 30, 2017, we had 25,355 employees, of which 25,053 were full-time employees. Approximately 4,600 employees were members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. Approximately one-third of our facilities have employees represented by unions with collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”). 
 During fiscal year 2017, eight CBAs covering approximately 800 employees were renegotiated. During fiscal 2018, 14 CBAs covering approximately 1,100 employees will be subject to renegotiation. While we have experienced work stoppages in the past, we generally believe we have good relations with both union and non-union employees, and we believe we are a well-regarded employer in the communities in which we operate.
