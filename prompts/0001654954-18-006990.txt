  Business Overview
  
  We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new generation medicines for depression and other diseases and disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) with high unmet need.
  
 Our lead CNS product candidate, AV-101, is an oral, non-opioid and non-sedating therapy that we believe offers the potential to be a new at-home treatment for multiple CNS indications with high unmet medical need. These indications include potential use as a new generation treatment alternative for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), as a non-addictive, non-sedating option for management of chronic neuropathic pain (CNP), to reduce dyskinesia induced by levodopa therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD LID), and additional CNS indications where modulation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor and AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor pathways may achieve therapeutic benefit.
  
  For MDD, we believe AV-101 has potential as a first line oral monotherapy and as an adjunctive oral therapy. As an adjunctive therapy, we believe AV-101 has potential both to displace atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole in the current MDD drug treatment paradigm both for patients with an inadequate response to current antidepressants approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to prevent relapse of MDD following successful treatment with the FDA-approved anesthetic, ketamine hydrochloride, an ion-channel blocking NDMA receptor antagonist (ketamine), whether administered by intravenous (IV) injection or as an intranasal spray formulation. We believe AV-101 may have potential to deliver ketamine-like antidepressant effects on an at-home basis, without the requirement for inconvenient administration in a medical setting, and without causing psychological or other side effects and safety concerns associated with ketamine therapy.
  
  AV-101 is in Phase 2 development in the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received authorization from the FDA to initiate ELEVATE, our Phase 2 multi-center, multi-dose, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AV-101 as an adjunctive treatment of MDD in adult patients with an inadequate therapeutic response to current FDA-approved antidepressants (the ELEVATE Study). As planned, we initiated the ELEVATE Study in the first quarter of 2018. Dr. Maurizio Fava, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director, Division of Clinical Research, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Research Institute, is the Principal Investigator of the ELEVATE Study assisting our internal team, which is led by Mark Smith, MD, PhD, our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Fava was the co-Principal Investigator with Dr. A. John Rush of the STAR*D study, the largest clinical trial conducted in depression to date, whose findings were published in journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). We currently anticipate top line results from the ELEVATE Study in the first half of 2019.
  
  AV-101 is also in the subject of a small Phase 2 clinical study being conducted and funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (the NIMH), pursuant to our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NIMH (the NIMH Study). Dr. Carlos Zarate, Jr., Chief of the NIMH’s Experimental Therapeutics & Pathophysiology Branch and its Section on Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, is acting as the Principal Investigator for the NIMH Study, which is focused on AV-101 monotherapy for subjects with treatment-resistant MDD and certain biomarkers. Dr. Zarate and the NIMH were among the first in the U.S. to conduct clinical studies demonstrating the robust, fast-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine in MDD patients with inadequate responses to multiple current FDA-approved antidepressants.
  
  In addition to our CNS business, we have two additional programs through our wholly-owned subsidiary VistaStem Therapeutics (VistaStem). VistaStem is focused on applying human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology to rescue, develop and commercialize (i) proprietary new chemical entities (NCEs) for CNS and other diseases and (ii) regenerative medicine (RM) involving hPSC-derived blood, cartilage, heart and liver cells. Our internal drug rescue programs are designed to utilize CardioSafe 3D, our customized cardiac bioassay system, to develop small molecule NCEs for our pipeline or out-licensing.  To advance potential RM applications of VistaStem’s cardiac stem cell technology, we have exclusively sublicensed to BlueRock Therapeutics LP, a next generation cell therapy and RM company established in 2016 with $225 million of committed capital from Bayer AG and Versant Ventures (BlueRock Therapeutics), rights to certain proprietary technologies relating to the production of cardiac stem cells for the treatment of heart disease (the BlueRock Agreement). In a manner similar to the BlueRock Agreement, we may pursue additional VistaStem collaborations or licensing transactions involving blood, cartilage, and/or liver cells derived from hPSCs for cell-based therapy, cell repair therapy, RM and/or tissue engineering.

  Our Strategy
  
 Our core strategy is to independently pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates that address high unmet medical needs of patients with CNS diseases and disorders. We have assembled a management team and a team of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of depression and other CNS diseases and disorders, with significant pharmaceutical industry and regulatory experience to lead and execute the development and commercialization of our CNS product candidate opportunities. As we continue to build and develop our product portfolio, we may opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships that maximize the value of our product candidate pipeline. 
  
 Key elements of our strategy are to:
  
 
● | Develop and commercialize AV-101 for depression. The ELEVATE Study is our ongoing Phase 2 clinical development program for AV-101 focused on our initial regulatory and commercial objective for AV-101: to displace atypical antipsychotics as the primary at-home adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with an inadequate response to current antidepressants approved by the FDA for at-home use. Following the completion of the ELEVATE Study, we intend to develop AV-101 internally and independently, through our initial pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for AV-101 focused on adjunctive treatment of MDD to augment current FDA-approved antidepressants, accompanied by submission to the FDA of our initial New Drug Application (NDA) for AV-101. In addition to adjunctive treatment of MDD with current antidepressants approved by the FDA for at-home use, we believe AV-101 may have therapeutic potential as a stand-alone first-line oral therapy for depression and as an at-home oral adjunctive treatment following in-clinic intravenous or intranasal administration of ketamine, to prevent relapse of MDD following cessation of ketamine treatment. If our initial MDD-related NDA is approved by the FDA, we may pursue strategic partnerships to maximize the commercial potential of AV-101 for these additional MDD indications and multiple other CNS indications. We may also contract for and/or establish a specialty sales force focused primarily on clinical psychiatrists and long-term care physicians who prescribe standard antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and ketamine for treatment of their MDD patients under the current and evolving MDD drug treatment paradigm.

● | Develop and commercialize AV-101 for multiple additional CNS diseases and disorders. We intend to independently pursue clinical development and commercialization of AV-101 across multiple CNS-related indications beyond depression that we believe are underserved by currently available medicines and represent significant unmet medical needs. Based on AV-101 preclinical studies, our successful first-in-human NIH-funded AV-101 Phase 1 clinical safety studies, and regulatory submissions related to the ELEVATE Study, we believe AV-101 also has potential as a non-addictive, non-opioid, non-sedating treatment alternative for chronic neuropathic pain, as well as several additional CNS indications where modulation of NMDA receptors and activation of AMPA pathways may achieve therapeutic benefit, including PD LID, epilepsy and Huntington’s disease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | License and/or acquire additional CNS product candidates. While our resources are currently focused on development of AV-101 for depression and additional CNS indications, we anticipate pursuing acquisition of additional CNS-related product candidates in the future, with an emphasis on opportunities related to neuropsychiatry. We believe that a diversified CNS product candidate portfolio, combined with our internal and collaborative network of CNS drug development expertise and ecosystem, will mitigate risks inherent in drug development and increase the likelihood of our success.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage VistaStem’s stem cell technology platform. We are applying VistaStem’s cardiac stem cell technology to screen and develop proprietary NCEs for our internal CNS drug development pipeline through drug rescue, without incurring many of the substantial costs and risks typically inherent in new drug discovery and nonclinical drug development. To further capitalize on VistaStem’s stem cell technology platform while supporting its CNS pipeline-enabling drug rescue programs, we may seek additional cell therapy and regenerative medicine collaborations, similar to the BlueRock Agreement, involving our intellectual property relating to blood, cartilage and/or liver cells.

 Our Programs
  
  AV-101 (L-4-cholorkyurenine or 4-Cl-KYN)
  
  Overview
  
 AV-101 is an oral prodrug candidate (4-Cl-KYN) in development for convenient at-home use to treat multiple CNS indications with high unmet medical need. After oral administration, AV-101 readily gains access to the CNS and is rapidly converted in vivo into its active metabolite, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), a well-characterized, potent and highly selective antagonist of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor at its glycine (GlyB) co-agonist binding site. 
  
  AV-101’s mechanism of action (MOA) involves both NMDA and AMPA receptors in the brain responsible for fast excitatory synaptic activity throughout the CNS.  AV-101’s MOA is fundamentally different from all FDA-approved antidepressants, as well as all FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics, drugs such as aripiprazole, that are often used adjunctively to augment standard antidepressants. For depression, we believe AV-101 has potential both as a stand-alone first-line oral monotherapy and as an adjunctive oral therapy for at-home use. As an adjunctive therapy, we believe AV-101 has potential for at-home use to both augment current antidepressants approved by the FA for at-home use and to prevent relapse of MDD following successful treatment with ketamine hydrochloride, an ion-channel blocking NDMA receptor antagonist (ketamine), administered in a clinical setting either by intravenous (IV) injection or as an intranasal spray formulation.
  
 Current evidence suggests that AV-101’s modulation of NMDA receptor signaling may provide faster-acting antidepressant effects in the treatment of MDD than current FDA-approved antidepressants. In addition, as confirmed in our AV-101 Phase 1 clinical studies, targeting and modulating or inhibiting activity of NMDA receptors at the specific GlyB site of the NMDA receptor, rather than blocking NMDA receptor activity, does not have the negative side effects typically associated with standard antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics often used adjunctively in the current MDD drug treatment paradigm, or classic ion channel-blocking NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine.

  We believe AV-101 may have potential to deliver ketamine-like antidepressant effects, without the need for inconvenient administration in a medical setting, and without causing psychological or other negative side effects and safety concerns often associated with ketamine therapy. As published in the October 2015 issue of the peer-reviewed Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, in an article titled, The prodrug 4-chlorokynurenine causes ketamine-like antidepressant effects, but not side effects, by NMDA/glycineB-site inhibition, using four well-established preclinical models of depression, AV-101 was shown to induce ketamine-like fast-acting, dose-dependent, persistent and statistically significant antidepressant-like responses following a single treatment. These responses were equivalent to those seen with a single sub-anesthetic control dose of ketamine. In addition, these studies confirmed that the fast-acting antidepressant effects of AV-101 were mediated through both GlyB site inhibition of the NMDA receptor and activation of the AMPA receptor pathway in the brain.
 Major Depressive Disorder
  
 Depression is a serious medical illness and a global public health concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 300 million people worldwide are affected by depression. According to the NIMH, major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S. The NIMH reports that, in 2016, approximately 16 million adults in the U.S. had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an August 2017 report, one in eight Americans over the age of 12 reported taking a standard, FDA-approved antidepressant in the previous month.
  
 While most people will experience depressed mood at some point during their lifetime, MDD is different. MDD is the chronic, pervasive feeling of utter unhappiness and suffering, which impairs daily functioning. Symptoms of MDD include diminished pleasure in activities, changes in appetite that result in weight changes, insomnia or oversleeping, psychomotor agitation, loss of energy or increased fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions, and thoughts of death or suicide and attempts at suicide. MDD is the psychiatric diagnosis most commonly associated with suicide, with the incidence of attempted suicide approximately 20 times higher in patients with MDD compared with the general population.
  
  Standard Antidepressants
  
  For many people, depression cannot be controlled for any length of time without treatment.  Standard depression medications available in the multi-billion-dollar global depression market, including commonly-prescribed SSRIs and SNRIs, have limited effectiveness, and, because of their mechanism of action, generally must be taken for at least four to six weeks before some patients may experience any notable therapeutic benefit.  Approximately two out of every three depression sufferers, including over an estimated 6.0 million drug-treated MDD patients in the U.S., do not receive adequate therapeutic benefits from their initial treatment with a standard antidepressant, and the likelihood of achieving remission of depressive symptoms declines with each successive treatment attempt. Even after multiple treatment attempts, approximately one out of every three depression sufferers still fails to find an adequately effective standard antidepressant. In addition, this trial and error process and the systemic effects of the various antidepressants involved may increase the risk of patient tolerability issues and serious side effects, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors in certain groups.
 Ketamine and NIMH Clinical Studies in Major Depressive Disorder
  
  Ketamine hydrochloride (ketamine) belongs to a class of drugs that block NMDA receptors, which are neurochemical receptors in the brain found on nerve cells that respond to glutamate, which is a chemical messenger that helps form and maintain important connections between neurons. Ketamine is an FDA-approved, rapid-acting general anesthetic currently administered only by intravenous or intramuscular injection. The off-label use of ketamine to treat MDD in treatment-resistant patients has been studied in several clinical trials conducted by depression experts at Yale University and other academic institutions, as well as at the NIMH, including by Dr. Carlos Zarate, Jr., the NIMH’s Chief of Experimental Therapeutics & Pathophysiology Branch and of the Section on Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood and Anxiety Disorders.  In randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trials reported by Dr. Zarate and others at the NIMH, a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) produced robust and rapid (within twenty-four hours) antidepressant effects in MDD patients who had not responded to standard antidepressants.  These results were in sharp contrast to the very slow onset of standard antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) that usually require many weeks of chronic usage to achieve similar antidepressant effects.  The potential for widespread therapeutic use of current FDA-approved ketamine, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule III drug, for MDD is limited by its potential for abuse, dissociative and other psychological side effects and by the inconvenience and practical challenges associated with the necessity of administration in a medical setting. Notwithstanding these limitations, however, the discovery of ketamine’s fast-acting antidepressant effects revolutionized thinking about the current MDD drug treatment paradigm and catalyzed research and development of a new generation of antidepressant medications with a faster-acting mechanism of action (MOA) similar to ketamine’s and fundamentally differentiated from all current FDA-approved antidepressants.  Our oral CNS drug candidate, AV-101 is among a new generation of antidepressants with potential to deliver faster-acting antidepressant effects than current antidepressants, without the side effects typically associated with current antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and ketamine.

   AV-101, Mechanism of Action and Major Depressive Disorder
  
  As described above, AV-101 (4-Cl-KYN) is an orally available prodrug candidate that produces, in the brain, 7-Cl-KYNA, one of the most potent and selective antagonists of the GlyB site of the NMDA receptor, resulting in the down-regulation of NMDA receptor signaling. Growing evidence suggests that glutamatergic activation involving AMPA receptors is central to the neurobiology and treatment of MDD and other mood disorders.
  
 AV-101’s mechanism of action (MOA) is fundamentally different from the MOA of all standard, FDA-approved antidepressants and all atypical antipsychotics used adjunctively to augment inadequate response to standard antidepressants, placing AV-101 among a “new generation” of antidepressants with potential to treat millions of MDD sufferers worldwide who are poorly served by SSRIs, SNRIs and other current depression therapies. AV-101 is functionally similar to ketamine in that both are believed to induce final common pathway antidepressant activity via glutamatergic activation involving AMPA receptors. However, AV-101 inhibits NMDA receptor channel activity, whereas ketamine blocks the ion channel of the NMDA receptor. AV-101, as a prodrug, produces in the brain an antagonist that inhibits the NMDA receptor by selectively binding to its functionally required GlyB site. Experimental evidence confirms that inhibiting the NMDA receptor by targeting the GlyB site can produce potent antidepressive effects and bypass adverse effects that result when ketamine blocks the NMDA receptor ion channel. Experimental evidence also supports the conclusion that this NMDA receptor inhibition by AV-101 may result in a glutamatergic activation that depends on the AMPA receptor pathway, resulting in an increase in neuronal connections that has been associated with the faster-acting antidepressant effects that are similar to those seen with ketamine, rather than those achieved by standard antidepressants.
  
 In peer-reviewed published preclinical studies, AV-101 caused fast-acting, ketamine-like antidepressant effects, including rapid onset and long duration of effect following a single treatment, without causing negative side effects associated with ketamine. In two NIH-funded randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 safety studies, AV-101 was found to be safe, well-tolerated and not associated with any severe adverse events. There were no signs of sedation, hallucinations or any of the psychological side effects often associated with ketamine and other channel-blocking NMDA receptor antagonists.
  
 Building on over $8.8 million of prior grant award funding from the NIH for preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development of AV-101, pursuant to our CRADA with the NIH, Dr. Carlos Zarate, Jr., as Principal Investigator, and his team at the NIMH are conducting, and the NIMH is funding, the NIMH Study.  Among the objectives of the NIMH Study, the NIMH is evaluating the ability of AV-101 to improve overall depressive symptomatology in subjects with treatment-resistant MDD, specifically whether subjects with treatment-resistant MDD have a greater and more rapid decrease in depressive symptoms when treated with AV-101 monotherapy than with placebo, as well as assessment of multiple biomarkers. 
  
 We are conducting our ELEVATE Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AV-101 as an adjunctive treatment of MDD in adult patients with an inadequate response to standard, FDA-approved antidepressants. We currently anticipate that top line results of the ELEVATE Study will be available in the first half of 2019. The Principal Investigator of the ELEVATE Study is Dr. Maurizio Fava of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Fava was the co-Principal Investigator with Dr. A. John Rush of the largest clinical trial ever conducted in depression, STAR*D, whose findings were published in journals such the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association.
 
  AV-101 as Adjunctive Treatment to Ketamine to Prevent Post-Ketamine MDD and/or Suicidal Ideation Relapse
  
 The use of ketamine to treat MDD has been studied in several clinical trials conducted by depression experts at numerous academic institutions and at the NIMH. In randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trials ketamine has produced robust and rapid (within twenty-four hours) antidepressant effects in MDD patients who had not responded to standard antidepressants.  We believe the potential for widespread and long-term use of ketamine may be limited by its potential for abuse, dissociative and other psychological side effects and by the inconvenience and practical challenges associated with required administration in a clinical setting. In the event that ketamine’s side effects, safety concerns, required in-clinic administration or other factors limit the use of ketamine and result in relapse of MDD and/or suicidal ideation, we believe AV-101 has potential to prevent relapse of MDD and/or suicidal ideation without ketamine-like side effects and safety concerns, when administered orally, on an at-home basis, following cessation of ketamine therapy. We plan to leverage our ELEVATE Study IND to conduct an exploratory Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of AV-101 as an adjunctive treatment to ketamine to prevent MDD and/or suicidal ideation relapse post-ketamine therapy.
  
  AV-101 and Neuropathic Pain
  
 Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic pain state that results from problems with signals from nerves. There are various causes of neuropathic pain, including tissue injury, nerve damage or disease, diabetes, infection, toxins, certain types of drugs, such as antivirals and chemotherapeutic agents, certain cancers, and even chronic alcohol intake. With neuropathic pain, damaged, dysfunctional or injured nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other pain centers and impact nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury.

 According to the WHO, about 116 million Americans were living with chronic pain in 2011.
  
 Many neuropathic pain treatments on the market today, including prescription opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, have side effects including anxiety, depression, dizziness, cognitive impairment and/or sedation.
  
 The effects of AV-101 were assessed in published peer-reviewed studies involving four well-established nonclinical models of pain, both hyperalgesia and allodynia, to examine its analgesic and behavioral profile. The publication, titled: “Characterization of the effects of L-4-chlorokynurenine on nociception in rodents,” by lead author, Tony L. Yaksh, Ph.D., Professor in Anesthesiology at the University of California, San Diego, was published in The Journal of Pain in April 2017 (J Pain. 18:1184-1196, 2017)). In these studies, systemic delivery of AV-101 yielded high brain concentrations of AV-101's active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA that were calculated to exceed its IC50 at the NMDA receptor GlyB site and resulted in robust, dose-dependent anti-nociceptive effects, similar to gabapentin, but with no discernable negative side effects. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant drug commonly used for neuropathic pain, causes sedation and mild cognitive impairment. Other commonly prescribed medications for neuropathic pain include drugs targeting opioid receptors in the brain. Unfortunately, misuse of such drugs can lead to a significantly increased risk of addiction, and, we believe, their therapeutic utility for neuropathic pain is unclear. Therefore, we believe AV-101, an oral drug candidate that does not target opioid receptors and is equally effective on pain, but is better tolerated than gabapentin, pregabalin or potentially addictive drugs targeting opioid receptors, could be an important treatment alternative for the millions of patients battling chronic neuropathic pain. Taken together with our successful AV-101 Phase 1a and 1b clinical safety studies, we believe the published results of these nonclinical studies support further clinical development of AV-101 in an exploratory Phase 2 clinical study to assess its potential as a non-opioid, non-addictive, non-sedating treatment to reduce debilitating neuropathic pain, especially diabetic neuropathic pain, effectively, without causing gabapentin- or pregabalin-like side effects or risk of addiction associated with pain medications targeting opioid receptors.
  
  AV-101 and Parkinson’s Disease Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia
  
  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive motor disorder that causes tremors, rigidity, slowed movements and postural instability. The Parkinson’s Foundation estimates that PD affects about one million people in the United States and ten million worldwide. The main finding in brains of people with PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons in the area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. The most commonly-prescribed treatments for PD are levodopa-based therapies. In the brain, levodopa is converted to dopamine to replace the dopamine loss caused by PD. Unfortunately, abnormal involuntary movements, called dyskinesias, gradually emerge as a prominent side-effect in response to previously beneficial doses of levodopa. Parkinson’s disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia (PD LID) can be severely disabling, rendering patients unable to perform routine daily tasks. It may be necessary to reduce the dose of levodopa to avoid dyskinesias, which may in turn exacerbate the core PD motor disorder. Studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Movement Disorders have shown PD LID develops in approximately 45% of levodopa-treated Parkinson’s disease patients after five years and 80% after 10 years of levodopa treatment. In the U.S., there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people with PD who are impacted by PD LID.
  
  AV-101 is not a dopamine-based drug candidate. Rather, it is believed to work through a different receptor in the brain that is equally important in PD, known as glutamate. We believe AV-101 has potential to reduce troublesome dyskinesia experienced by many patients with Parkinson’s disease as a result of their levodopa therapy, but without interfering with levodopa or causing side effects resulting from certain current PD LID treatments, including hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, swelling of legs and feet, constipation and falls.
  
  In a monkey model of Parkinson’s disease, AV-101 (250 mg/kg and 450 mg/kg) resulted in a 30% reduction of the mean dyskinesia score associated with PD LID. Maximum dyskinesia scores were also reduced by 17%. Importantly, AV-101 did not reduce the anti-parkinsonian therapeutic benefit of levodopa. Moreover, the duration of levodopa response and delay to levodopa effect were not affected by treatment with AV-101.  We believe these preclinical data warrant clinical development of AV-101 in an exploratory Phase 2 clinical study to assess its potential in Parkinson’s disease patients diagnosed with PD LID.
  
  AV-101 and Epilepsy
  
 AV-101 has been shown to protect against seizures and neuronal damage in animal models of epilepsy, providing preclinical support for its potential as a novel treatment alternative for epilepsy. Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, affecting almost 1% of the worldwide population. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, as many as three million Americans have epilepsy, and one-third of those suffering from epilepsy are not effectively treated with currently available medications. In addition, standard anticonvulsants can cause significant side effects, which frequently interfere with compliance.
  
 Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is critically involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Through its stimulation of the NMDA receptor subtype, glutamate has been implicated in the neuropathology and clinical symptoms of the disease. In support of this, NMDA receptor antagonists are potent anticonvulsants. However, classic NMDA receptor antagonists are limited by adverse effects, such as neurotoxicity, declining mental status, and the onset of psychotic symptoms following administration of the drug. The endogenous amino acid glycine modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by stimulating the GlyB co-agonist site of the NMDA receptor. GlyB site antagonists inhibit NMDA receptor function and are therefore anticonvulsant and neuroprotective. Importantly, GlyB site antagonists have fewer and less severe side effects than classic channel-blocking NMDA receptor antagonists and other antiepileptic agents, making them a safer potential alternative to, and one expected to be associated with greater patient compliance than, available anticonvulsant medications.

 AV-101 has two additional therapeutically important properties as a drug candidate for treatment of epilepsy:
  
 
1. | AV-101 is preferentially converted to 7-Cl-KYNA in brain areas related to neuronal injury as a result of astrocytes, which are responsible for the enzymatic transamination of 4-Cl-KYN prodrug to active 7-Cl-KYNA, becoming focally activated at sites of neuronal injury. Due to AV-101’s highly focused site of conversion, local concentrations of newly formed 7-Cl-KYNA are greatest at the site of therapeutic need. In addition to delivering the drug where it is needed, this reduces the chance of systemic and dangerous side effects with long-term use of the drug; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | An active metabolite of AV-101, 4-Cl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, inhibits the synthesis of quinolinic acid, an endogenous NMDA receptor agonist that causes convulsions and excitotoxic neuronal damage.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 AV-101’s ability to activate astrocytes for focal delivery of an anti-epileptic principle, and its dual action as a NMDAR GlyB antagonist and quinolinic acid synthesis inhibitor, make AV-101 a potential Phase 2 development candidate for treatment of epilepsy.
  
  AV-101 and Huntington’s Disease
  
 Working together with metabotropic glutamate receptors, the NMDA receptor ensures the establishment of long-term potentiation (LTP), a process believed to be responsible for the acquisition of information. These functions are mediated by calcium entry through the NMDA receptor-associated channel, which in turn influences a wide variety of cellular components, like cytoskeletal proteins or second-messenger synthases. However, over activation at the NMDA receptor triggers an excessive entry of calcium ions, initiating a series of cytoplasmic and nuclear processes that promote neuronal cell death through necrosis as well as apoptosis, and these mechanisms have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases.
  
 Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disorder that causes degeneration of brain cells, called neurons, in motor control regions of the brain, as well as other areas. Symptoms of the disease, which gets progressively worse, include uncontrolled movements (called chorea), abnormal body postures, and changes in behavior, emotion, judgment, and cognition. HD is caused by an expansion in the number of glutamine repeats beyond 35 at the amino terminal end of a protein termed “huntingtin.” Such a mutation in huntingtin leads to a sequence of progressive cellular changes in the brain that result in neuronal loss and other characteristic neuropathological features of HD. These are most prominent in the neostriatum and in the cerebral cortex, but also observed in other brain areas.
  
 The tissue levels of two neurotoxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation, quinolinic acid (QUIN) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) are increased in the striatum and neocortex, but not in the cerebellum, in early stage HD. QUIN and 3-HK and especially the joint action of these two metabolites, have long been associated with the neurodegenerative and other features of the pathophysiology of HD. The neuronal death caused by QUIN and 3-HK is due to both free radical formation and NMDA receptor overstimulation (excitotoxicity).
  
 Based on the hypothesis that 3-HK and QUIN are involved in the progression of HD, early intervention aimed at affecting the kynurenine pathway in the brain may present a promising treatment strategy. We believe the ability of AV-101 to reduce the brain levels of neurotoxic QUIN and to potentially produce significant local concentrations of 7-Cl-KYNA on chronic administration, may present an exciting opportunity for exploratory Phase 2 clinical investigation of AV-101 as a potential chronic treatment alternative for certain symptoms of HD.
  
  AV-101 Phase 1 Clinical Safety Studies
  
 The safety data from two NIH-funded AV-101 Phase 1 clinical safety studies indicate that AV-101 was safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects at all doses tested, in both single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose studies. There were no adverse effects (AEs) reported by subjects that received AV-101 that were graded as probably related to study drug. The type and distribution of AEs reported by subjects in the studies were considered to be typical for studies in healthy volunteers. All AEs were completely resolved. Further, no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.
  
 The Pharmacokinetics (PK) of AV-101 were fully characterized across the range of doses in these Phase 1a and 1b studies. Plasma concentration-time profiles obtained for 4-Cl-KYN (AV-101) and 7-Cl-KYNA after administration of a single escalating dose (Phase 1a) and multiple, once daily oral doses of 360, 1,080, or 1,440 mg for 14 days (Phase 1b) were consistent with rapid absorption of the oral dose and first-order elimination of both analytes, with evidence of multi-compartment kinetics, particularly for the AV-101’s active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA.
  
 Although the Phase 1 safety and PK studies were not designed to measure or evaluate the potential antidepressant effects of AV-101, approximately 9% (5/54) of the subjects receiving AV-101 and 0% of the 30 subjects receiving placebo reported “feelings of well-being” (coded as euphoric mood), similar to the fast-acting antidepressant effects reported in the literature with ketamine.

  VistaStem Therapeutics and our Stem Cell Programs 
 
  VistaStem Therapeutics (VistaStem) is our wholly owned subsidiary focused on applying human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology to discover, rescue, develop and commercialize proprietary new chemical entities (NCEs) for our CNS development pipeline and cellular therapies and regenerative medicine (RM) involving hPSC-derived blood, cartilage, heart and liver cells. We used our hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (human heart cells) to develop CardioSafe 3D™, our customized in vitro bioassay system for predicting heart toxicity of drug rescue NCEs.  We believe CardioSafe 3D is more comprehensive and clinically predictive than the hERG assay, which currently is the only in vitro cardiac safety assay required by FDA guidelines, and provides us with new generation human cell-based technology to identify and evaluate drug rescue candidates and develop drug rescue NCEs for our CNS development pipeline and/or out-licensing.
 Scientific Background
  
 Stem cells are the building blocks of all cells of the human body.  They have the potential to develop into many different mature cell types.  Stem cells are defined by a minimum of two key characteristics: (i) their capacity to self-renew, or divide in a way that results in more stem cells; and (ii) their capacity to differentiate, or turn into mature, specialized cells that make up tissues and organs.  There are many different types of stem cells that come from different places in the body or are formed at different times throughout our lives, including pluripotent stem cells and adult or tissue-specific stem cells, which are limited to differentiating into the specific cell types of the tissues in which they reside. We focus exclusively on human pluripotent stem cells.
  
 Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be differentiated into all of the more than 200 types of cells in the human body, can be expanded readily, and have diverse medical research, drug discovery, drug rescue, drug development and therapeutic applications. We believe hPSCs can be used to develop numerous cell types, tissues and customized assays that can mimic complex human biology, including heart and liver biology for drug rescue.
  
 Human pluripotent stem cells are either embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  Both hESCs and iPSCs have the capacity to be maintained and expanded in an undifferentiated state indefinitely. We believe these features make them highly useful research and development tools and as a source of normal, functionally mature cell populations. We use multiple types of these mature cells as the foundation to design and develop novel, customized bioassay systems to test the safety and efficacy of NCEs in vitro. These cells also have potential for diverse cellular therapy and regenerative medicine applications.
  
  CardioSafe 3D vs. hERG Assay
  
 The limitations of current preclinical drug testing systems used by pharmaceutical companies and others contribute to the high failure rate of NCEs.  Incorporating novel in vitro assays using hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) early in preclinical development offers the potential to improve clinical predictability, decrease development costs, and avoid adverse patient effects, late-stage clinical termination, and product recall from the market.
  
 We produce functional, non-transformed hPSC-CMs at a high level of purity and with normal ratios of all important cardiac cell types.  Importantly, our hPSC-CM differentiation protocols do not involve either genetic modification or antibiotic selection. This is important because genetic modification and antibiotic selection can distort the ratio of cardiac cell types and have a direct impact on the ultimate results and clinical predictivity of assays that incorporate hPSC-CMs produced in such a manner. In addition to normal expression all of the key ion channels of the human heart (calcium, potassium and sodium) and various cardiomyocytic markers of the human heart, our CardioSafe 3D cardiac toxicity assays screening for both direct cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity and arrhythmogenesis (or development of irregular beating patterns). We believe CardioSafe 3D is sensitive, stable, reproducible and capable of generating data enabling a more accurate prediction of the in vivo cardiac effects of NCEs than is possible with existing preclinical testing systems, particularly the hERG assay, which uses either transformed hamster ovary cells or human kidney cells and is currently the only in vitro cardiac safety assay required by FDA Guidelines (ICH57B). We believe the clinical predictivity of the hERG assay is limited because it assesses only a single cardiac ion channel - the hERG potassium ion channel – and does not assess any other clinically relevant cardiac ion channels, including calcium, non-hERG potassium and sodium ion channels. In addition, the hERG assay does not assess clinically relevant cardiac biological effects associated with cardiomyocyte viability, including apoptosis and other forms of cytotoxicity, as well as energy, mitochondria and oxidative stress. As a result of its limitations, results of the hERG assay can lead to false negative and false positive predictions regarding the cardiac safety of new drug candidates.
  
 We believe that CardioSafe 3D provides valuable and more comprehensive bioanalytical tools for in vitro cardiac safety screening than the hERG assay.

  Using CardioSafe 3D to Develop Drug Rescue NCEs
  
 Our drug rescue activities are focused on producing for our internal CNS pipeline or out-licensing proprietary, safer variants of still-promising NCEs previously discovered, optimized and tested for efficacy by pharmaceutical companies and others but terminated before FDA approval due to unexpected heart toxicity. Our drug rescue strategy involves using CardioSafe 3D to assess the cardiac toxicity that caused certain NCEs available in the public to be terminated, and using that insight to produce and develop a new, potentially safer, and proprietary NCEs for our CNS pipeline or out-licensing. We believe the pre-existing public domain knowledge base supporting the therapeutic and commercial potential of NCEs we target for our drug rescue programs will provide us with a valuable head start as we launch each of our drug rescue programs. Leveraging the substantial prior investments by global pharmaceutical companies and others in discovery, optimization and efficacy validation of the NCEs we identify in the public domain is an essential component of our drug rescue strategy.
  
 By using CardioSafe 3D to enhance our understanding of the cardiac liability profile of  NCEs, insight not previously available when the NCEs were originally discovered, optimized for efficacy and developed, we believe we can demonstrate preclinical proof-of-concept (POC) as to the efficacy and safety of new, safer drug rescue NCEs in standard in vitro and in vivo models, as well as in CardioSafe 3D, earlier in development and with substantially less investment in discovery and preclinical development than was required of pharmaceutical companies and others prior to their decision to terminate the original NCE. 
  
 Our goal in each drug rescue program will be to produce a proprietary drug rescue NCE and establish its preclinical POC, using standard preclinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety models, as well as CardioSafe 3D. In this context, POC means that the lead drug rescue NCE, as compared to the original, previously-terminated NCE, demonstrates both (i) equal or superior efficacy in the same, or a similar, in vitro and in vivo preclinical efficacy models used by the initial developer of the previously-terminated NCE before it was terminated for safety reasons, and (ii) significant reduction of concentration dependent cardiotoxicity in CardioSafe 3D.
  
  Regenerative Medicine
  
 We believe stem cell technology-based cell therapy and regenerative medicine (RM) have the potential to transform healthcare in the U.S. and certain other large markets over the next decade by providing new approaches for treating the fundamental mechanisms of disease. We currently intend to establish strategic cell therapy- and/or RM-focused collaborations to leverage our stem cell technology platform, our expertise in human biology, differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to develop functional adult human cells and tissues involved in human disease, including blood, bone, cartilage, heart and liver cells for cell therapy and RM purposes. In December 2016, we exclusively sublicensed to BlueRock Therapeutics, a next generation RM company established by Bayer AG and Versant Ventures, rights to certain proprietary technologies relating to the production of cardiac stem cells for the treatment of heart disease.  In a manner similar to our exclusive sublicense agreement with BlueRock Therapeutics, we may pursue additional cell therapy and RM collaborations or licensing transactions involving blood, cartilage, and/or liver cells derived from hPSCs for cell-based therapy, cell repair therapy, and/or tissue engineering. 
 Intellectual Property
  
 We rely upon patents as a major component of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio, as is typical for development-stage biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, from time to time, we enter into patent license agreements to acquire rights to IP and to provide certain IP rights to commercialization partners. We also rely, in part, on trade secrets for protection of some of our discoveries. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators and third parties. We also own several registered and common-law trademarks.
  
 To help protect our IP rights, our employees, contractors and consultants also sign agreements in which they assign to us, for example, their interests in patents, trade secrets and copyrights arising from their work for us.
  
 From time to time, we may sponsor or facilitate research with key scientists in academic institutions to advance or supplement our internal research and development activities and objectives. These sponsored research agreements generally provide us with an opportunity to negotiate a new license, or acquire a substantially prescribed license, to acquire IP rights in the results of the sponsored research.
  
  AV-101
  
 We have developed a portfolio of IP assets around AV-101, which involves obtaining patents and protecting trade secrets. In addition to these IP assets, we plan to seek regulatory exclusivity for the use of AV-101, with initial emphasis on treating depression as our lead indication in clinical development. These two approaches to obtaining exclusivity exist separately in the US and in several other countries and would be expected to provide complementary protection in countries where they are available.

  Although AV-101 (also known as L-4-Cl-kynurenine) is not itself patent protected as a chemical compound, as part of our strategy to seek and secure broad commercial exclusivity for AV-101, we have pursued related patents in the U.S., Europe, and other selected major pharmaceutical markets, including China, Japan and Korea. For example, some of our granted AV-101 patents and pending applications relate to the treatment of depression and others relate to the treatment of additional CNS diseases and disorders, including, among others, Parkinson’s disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia and the management of certain types of neuropathic pain. Several of these patent applications were allowed or have been granted, relating to certain oral unit dose formulations of AV-101 without any restriction as to the particular medical condition, disease or disorder to be treated and, in certain countries, relating to novel therapeutic methods for treatment of depression and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Additional granted patents and pending applications involve methods to synthesize AV-101. We expect that our granted patents will not begin to expire until 2034, and we plan to seek patent term extensions in places, such as the U.S., Europe and Japan, where they are available.
  
 As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are currently involved with the NIMH Study being conducted by the NIMH. As part of our analysis of the study results, we will be evaluating the possibility of seeking additional patent protection in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, Korea and selected major markets based on the clinical data and on clinical observations.
  
 As mentioned above, a complementary component of our plan is to obtain regulatory exclusivity for approved therapeutic indications for AV-101. For example, the FDA’s New Drug Product Exclusivity is available for NCEs such as AV-101, which have not been previously approved by the FDA. This provides the holder of an FDA-approved NDA with up to five years of protection from competition in the U.S. marketplace from generic versions of the same product. As applicable, we will pursue similar types of regulatory exclusivity in other regions, such as Europe, and in certain other countries.
  
 There is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining any additional patents related to AV-101 in the U.S., Europe, or any other country, or that if we are successful in obtaining any patents that we would also be successful in protecting those patents against challengers or in enforcing them to stop infringement. Outside the U.S. and Europe, we are pursuing patent rights in a limited number of countries that we believe are the major markets for pharmaceuticals where having patent rights should substantially facilitate commercialization of AV-101.
 
  Stem Cell Technology
  
 We have obtained and are pursuing IP rights to several stem cell technologies through a combination of our own patent properties, exclusive and non-exclusive patent and technology licenses, and participation in sponsored research relationships. Generally, our stem cell IP portfolio relates to drug development and drug discovery. It also relates to production systems of enriched populations of certain stem cell and differentiated cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, and the use of various cell types that have been differentiated from pluripotent stem cells for those and other purposes including cell-based therapy and RM. Additionally, we maintain certain trade secrets regarding our stem cell technology.
  
 Overall, our stem cell patent portfolio includes several issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications as well as foreign counterpart patents and applications in countries of commercial interest to us such as China, Japan and Korea.
  
 The patent properties in these families are based on discoveries from our internal research and development activities, research that we have sponsored at various academic institutions, as well as from patent license agreements signed with the University Health Network (Toronto) and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
  
 These license agreements generally require us to pay nominal annual license fees, and, in certain cases, patent prosecution and maintenance fees, and royalty payments that vary based on product sales and services that are covered by the licensed patent rights, as well fees for sublicensing. As noted above in the context of AV-101 IP, there is also no guarantee that we will successfully obtain stem cell related patents in the countries in which we are pursuing patent rights or that we would be successful in enforcing granted patent rights against infringers.
  
 In December 2016, we exclusively sublicensed to BlueRock Therapeutics, Inc., a company founded by Bayer AG and Versant Ventures to usher in a new era of cell-based medicine that repairs the body when it cannot repair itself, rights to certain proprietary technologies relating to the production of cardiac stem cells for the treatment of heart disease.
  
  Strategic Transactions and Relationships
 
 Strategic collaborations are an important cornerstone of our corporate development strategy. We believe that our highly selective outsourcing of certain research, development, manufacturing and regulatory activities gives us flexible access to a broad range of capabilities and expertise at a lower overall cost than developing and maintaining such capabilities and expertise internally on a full-time basis. In particular, we contract with third parties for certain manufacturing, nonclinical development, clinical development and regulatory affairs support. Our current strategic collaborations include our CRADA with the NIMH, pursuant to which the NIMH is conducting the NIMH Study, and our relationships with Cato Research Ltd. as our contract research organization (CRO) for the ELEVATE Study and Norac Pharma as our contract manufacturing organization (CMO) currently responsible for the production of our AV-101 drug substance.

   Manufacturing 
 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. As a key part of our product development approach, we aim to complete formulation work at an early stage of development, such that our clinical studies are conducted with a formulation that has the potential for eventual scale-up.  All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Commercialization 
 
 We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, to commercialize our product candidates in the United States. We may work in combination with one or more pharmaceutical partners for certain indications, where specialist capabilities are needed. Depending on the specific development path pursued, this may include larger depression and neuropathic pain indications. For other, more specialized indications, we intend to commercialize our product candidates independently. For example, we believe the patient and prescriber populations for PD LID are relatively concentrated and can be addressed with a focused sales team. We will, however, continuously review our partnering strategy in the light of new clinical data and market understanding. We may enter into development and/or commercialization arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions outside the United States. 
 Competition
  
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large and growing markets for MDD, neuropathic pain, PD LID, and other CNS diseases and disorders make them attractive therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical businesses. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Several of these entities have commercial products, robust drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of branded and generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
 Although currently there are no FDA-approved therapies for MDD with the mechanism of action of AV-101, we are aware of a number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty pharmaceutical companies that are developing therapies targeting NMDA receptors. Most of the therapies being developed are broad NMDA receptor antagonists and tend to have multiple target actions, we believe AV-101 is an NMDA receptor GlyB antagonist and is truly modulatory, without negative off-target activity in preclinical screening. We are aware of the following companies developing or commercializing NMDA receptor-targeted therapies, including but not limited to, Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, AmKor Pharma, Aptynix, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Axsome Therapeutics, Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. Ltd., Cadent Therapeutics, Cerecor, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Immune Pharmaceuticals, Intra-Cellular Therapies, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, NeuroRx, Newron Pharmaceuticals, Otonomy, Relmada Therapeutics, Sage Therapeutics and UCB. In the field of new generation, orally available, adjunctive treatments of adult MDD patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressants, and with an initial objective of displacing atypical antipsychotics in the current MDD drug treatment paradigm, we believe our principal competitor may be Alkermes’ orally available drug candidate, ALKS-5461, an opioid modulator for which Alkermes has submitted an NDA with the FDA.
  
 Additionally, we expect that AV-101 will have to compete with a variety of therapeutic procedures. such as psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy.
  
 While we believe that our employees and consultants, scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments.  
  
 We believe that VistaStem’s stem cell technology platform, the hPSC-derived human cells we produce, and the customized human cell-based assay systems we have formulated and developed are capable of being competitive in the diverse and growing global stem cell, cell therapy and RM markets, including markets involving the sale of hPSC-derived cells to third-parties for their in vitro drug discovery and safety testing, contract predictive toxicology drug screening services for third parties, internal drug discovery, drug development and drug rescue of new NCEs, and RM, including in vivo cell therapy research and development. A representative list of such biopharmaceutical companies pursuing one or more of these potential applications of adult and/or hPSC technology includes the following: Acea Biosciences, Astellas, Athersys, BioCardia, BioTime, Caladrius Biosciences, Cellectis Bioresearch, Cellerant Therapeutics, Cytori Therapeutics, Fujifilm Holdings, HemoGenix, International Stem Cell, Neuralstem, Organovo Holdings, PluriStem Therapeutics, and Stemina BioMarker Discovery. Pharmaceutical companies and other established corporations such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Charles River, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche Holdings, Thermo Fisher Scientific and others have been and are expected to continue pursuing internally various stem cell-related research and development programs. Many of the foregoing companies have greater resources and capital availability and as a result, may be more successful in their research and development programs than us.  We anticipate that acceptance and use of hPSC technology for drug development and regenerative medicine will continue to occur and increase at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the future.

  Government Regulation
  
 Our business activities, including the manufacturing, research, development and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any new drug developed by us or our collaborators must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, import, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Moreover, government coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly impact our ability to successfully commercialize any future approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be impacted by enacted and any applicable future healthcare reform and drug pricing measures. In addition, we are subject to state and federal laws, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and transparency laws that restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry.
  
 In the United States, drug product candidates intended for human use undergo laboratory and animal testing until adequate proof of safety is established. Clinical trials for new product candidates are then typically conducted in humans in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. The emphasis of Phase 1 trials is on testing for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the compound for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a compound shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes. Before commencing clinical investigations in humans, we or our collaborators must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA.
  
 Regulatory authorities, Institutional Review Boards and Data Monitoring Committees may require additional data before allowing clinical studies to commence, continue or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. We have in the past and may in the future rely on assistance from our third-party collaborators and contract service providers to file our INDs and generally support our development and regulatory activities approval process for our potential products. Clinical testing must also meet requirements for clinical trial registration, institutional review board oversight, informed consent, health information privacy, and good clinical practices, or GCPs. Additionally, the manufacture of our drug product, must be done in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs).
  
 To establish a new product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the FDA requires companies seeking approval to market a drug product to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data, along with other information, for each indication for which the product will be labeled. The data and information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA), which must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies. Generating the required data and information for an NDA takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product candidate under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate. Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the NDA. If deemed sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will “file” the NDA. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal goals of eight months from submission for priority review of NDAs that cover product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and 12 months from submission for the standard review of NDAs. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, these performance goals may change over time and the review is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the NDA can be approved. Before approving an NDA, the FDA can choose to inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs. The FDA may also audit sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. The FDA’s review of an NDA may also involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee, particularly for novel indications. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
  
 In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy, regulations or statutes governing product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review.

 Before receiving FDA approval to market a potential product, we or our collaborators must demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that the potential product is safe and effective in the patient population that will be treated. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless a waiver applies. If regulatory approval of a potential product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is approved. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is generally prohibited. Furthermore, FDA approval may entail ongoing requirements for risk management, including post-marketing, or Phase 4, studies. Even if approval is obtained, a marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to payment of significant annual fees and continuing review and periodic inspections by the FDA. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including labeling changes, warning letters, costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market.
  
 Any drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or during clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates. Further, such unacceptable toxicity or side effects could ultimately prevent a potential product’s approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or limit any labeling claims and market acceptance, even if the product is approved.
  
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
  
 Any trade name that we intend to use for a potential product must be approved by the FDA irrespective of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The FDA conducts a rigorous review of proposed product names, and may reject a product name if it believes that the name inappropriately implies medical claims or if it poses the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA will not approve a trade name until the NDA for a product is approved. If the FDA determines that the trade names of other products that are approved prior to the approval of our potential products may present a risk of confusion with our proposed trade name, the FDA may elect to not approve our proposed trade name. If our trade name is rejected, we will lose the benefit of any brand equity that may already have been developed for this trade name, as well as the benefit of our existing trademark applications for this trade name.
  
 We and our collaborators and contract manufacturers also are required to comply with the applicable FDA cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the FDA. These facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our potential products and must maintain ongoing compliance for commercial product manufacture. The FDA may conclude that we or our collaborators or contract manufacturers are not in compliance with applicable cGMP requirements and other FDA regulatory requirements, which may result in delay or failure to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls and/or imposition of fines or penalties.
  
 If a product is approved, we must also comply with post-marketing requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with advertising and promotion laws enforced by various government agencies, including the FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, through such laws as the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, healthcare information privacy and security laws, post-marketing safety surveillance, and disclosure of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state regulation including, for example, the implementation of corporate compliance programs.
  
 If we elect to distribute our products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.

 Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Community (EC), centralized registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EC member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, marketing authorization will be granted. This foreign regulatory development and approval process involves all of the risks associated with achieving FDA marketing approval in the U.S. as discussed above. In addition, foreign regulations may include applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities.

 Potential sales of AV-101 or any other future product candidate, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover AV-101, if approved, or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
  
 In the United States, the Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary outpatient drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries for certain products. We do not know whether AV-101, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but individual Medicare Part D plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. In addition, while Medicare Part D plans have historically included “all or substantially all” drugs in the following designated classes of “clinical concern” on their formularies: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antineoplastics, antipsychotics, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has in the past proposed, but not adopted, changes to this policy. If this policy is changed in the future and if CMS no longer considers the antidepressant class to be of “clinical concern”, Medicare Part D plans would have significantly more discretion to reduce the number of products covered in that class. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies.
  
  Healthcare Laws and Regulations
  
 Sales of AV-101, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:
  
   ●
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.

 
   ●
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent.

 
   ●
 The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA ) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

 
   ●
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH ) and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information.

 
   ●
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

 Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
  
  Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws as well to compliance with the U.S Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
  
  Stem Cell Technology - United States
  
 With respect to our stem cell research and development in the U.S., the U.S. government has established requirements and procedures relating to the isolation and derivation of certain stem cell lines and the availability of federal funds for research and development programs involving those lines. All of the stem cell lines that we are using were either isolated under procedures that meet U.S. government requirements and are approved for funding from the U.S. government, or were isolated under procedures that meet U.S. government requirements.
  
 All procedures we use to obtain clinical samples, and the procedures we use to isolate hESCs, are consistent with the informed consent and ethical guidelines promulgated by the U.S. National Academy of Science, the International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), or the NIH. These procedures and documentation have been reviewed by an external Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee, and all cell lines we use have been approved under one or more of these guidelines.
  
 The U.S. government and its agencies on July 7, 2009 published guidelines for the ethical derivation of hESCs required for receiving federal funding for hESC research. Should we seek further NIH funding for our stem cell research and development, our request would involve the use of hESC lines that meet the NIH guidelines for NIH funding. In the U.S., the President’s Council on Bioethics monitors stem cell research, and may make recommendations from time to time that could place restrictions on the scope of research using human embryonic or fetal tissue. Although numerous states in the U.S. are considering, or have in place, legislation relating to stem cell research, it is not yet clear what affect, if any, state actions may have on our ability to commercialize stem cell technologies. 
  
  Subsidiaries and Inter-Corporate Relationships

  Corporate History
  
  VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc., a California corporation incorporated on May 26, 1998, dba VistaStem, is our wholly-owned subsidiary. Excaliber Enterprises, Ltd. (Excaliber), a publicly-held company (formerly OTCBB: EXCA) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2005. Pursuant to a strategic merger transaction on May 11, 2011, Excaliber acquired all outstanding shares of VistaStem in exchange for 341,823 shares of our common stock and assumed all of VistaStem’s pre-Merger obligations (the Merger). Shortly after the Merger, Excaliber’s name was changed to “VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc.” (a Nevada corporation).
  
  VistaStem, as the accounting acquirer in the Merger, recorded the Merger as the issuance of common stock for the net monetary assets of Excaliber, accompanied by a recapitalization.  The accounting treatment for the Merger was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that we recorded no goodwill or other intangible assets. A total of 78,450 shares of our common stock, representing the shares held by stockholders of Excaliber immediately prior to the Merger are reflected as outstanding for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the $0.001 par value of Excaliber’s common stock.
  
  The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report represent the activity of VistaStem from May 26, 1998, and the consolidated activity of VistaStem and Excaliber (now VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation), from May 11, 2011 (the date of the Merger) through March 31, 2018. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of VistaStem’s two inactive wholly-owned subsidiaries, Artemis Neuroscience, Inc., a Maryland corporation (Artemis), and VistaStem Canada, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario, Canada (VistaStem Canada).
