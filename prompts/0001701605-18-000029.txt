ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Baker Hughes, a GE company (the Company, BHGE, we, us, or our), a Delaware corporation, was formed on October 28, 2016, for the purpose of facilitating the combination of Baker Hughes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (Baker Hughes), and the oil and gas business (GE O&G) of General Electric Company (GE). 
On July 3, 2017, we closed our business combination (the Transactions) to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated equipment and service capabilities (refer to "Note 2. Business Acquisition" of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further details on the Transactions). As a result of the Transactions, the Company became the holding company of the combined businesses of Baker Hughes and GE O&G. Substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of Baker Hughes was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC), on July 3, 2017. GE has approximately 62.5% of economic interest in BHGE LLC and the Company has approximately 37.5% of the remaining economic interest in BHGE LLC, held indirectly through two wholly owned subsidiaries. One of these wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company is the sole managing member of BHGE LLC. Although we hold a minority economic interest in BHGE LLC, we conduct and exercise full control over all activities of BHGE LLC, without the approval of any other member, through this wholly owned subsidiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of BHGE LLC and report a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in BHGE LLC not held by us. We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and tax related balances. BHGE LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov. 
The Transactions were treated as a “reverse acquisition” for accounting purposes and, as such, the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial statements of the Company. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis, effective July 3, 2017. For all periods prior to July 3, 2017, the Company’s financial statements were prepared on a combined basis. The combined financial statements combine certain accounts of GE and its subsidiaries that were historically managed as part of its oil & gas business. The historical financial results in the combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had GE O&G operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during those periods. The GE O&G numbers in the consolidated and combined statements of income (loss) and statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. We believe that the current presentation is a more appropriate presentation of the combined businesses.
OUR VISION
We are the only fullstream provider of integrated oilfield products, services and digital solutions with 2017 revenue of $17.3 billion and a presence in more than 120 countries. We strive to provide best-in-class physical and digital technology solutions for customer productivity, leveraging complementary technologies to serve customers across the full spectrum of the oil and gas value chain. 
We believe that there are structural changes taking place in the oil and gas industry that require a change in how we work. No matter the oil price, our customers are looking for new models and solutions to deliver higher industrial yield, which means improving productivity and efficiency and leveraging economies of scale, with lower carbon impact. While we will continue to serve customers on a project basis, our fullstream portfolio, digital capabilities and leading technology and services will enable us to shift towards outcome-focused solutions, enabling customers to lower capital and operating costs, reduce non-productive time and boost resource recovery. This is the cornerstone of our corporate strategy that is based on three pillars. 

• | We intend to build market leading product companies focused on comprehensively reducing product and service costs, while improving equipment efficiency and reliability to significantly lower project breakeven costs.

BHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 1


• | We strive to create value through integrated and differentiated equipment and service modules that will impact our customers total cost of projects and operations as well as fundamentally improving industry productivity, and


• | We plan to continue to develop fullstream opportunities that drive value creation through radical improvements in total cost reduction and productivity increases for the industry.

We expect to benefit from the following:

• | Complete fullstream portfolio. Leading portfolio capable of serving upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, matching oilfield service and equipment leaders in many areas. Our four product lines - Oilfield Services; Oilfield Equipment; Turbomachinery & Process Solutions; and Digital Solutions, as discussed below under "Products and Services," are each among the top four providers in their respective segments. 


• | Complementary technology. We have a culture built on a heritage of innovation and invention in research and development, with complementary capabilities. Technology remains a differentiator and enables us to deliver across the value chain. Given our breadth and depth, we can leverage our technology, talent and expertise across our portfolio to accelerate the pace of innovation. 


• | Digital capabilities. We expect to be able to continue to develop software offerings on any operating platform, for new and extended applications in the oil and gas and other industrial ecosystems, such as machine and equipment health, reliability management and maintenance optimization. 

We believe we are positioned to assist our customers as they balance investment decisions between greenfield projects, brownfield projects and optimizing existing assets as a result of the current macroeconomic environment and the potentially prolonged period of lower oil prices. We expect that aging fields will require increased maintenance and intervention to sustain production later into the well life cycle when depletion accelerates. We believe our strategy coupled with our capabilities will help us compete and win in the current environment, while positioning us for the future.
ORDERS AND BACKLOG
We are a global business with consolidated 2017 revenue of $17,259 million. We generate revenue and orders from a combination of equipment sales and services. In 2017, 42% of revenue was generated from equipment sales and 58% from services, while 39% of orders were for equipment and 61% for services. In 2016 and 2015, 46% and 50% of revenue was generated from equipment sales, and 54% and 50% of revenue was from services, respectively. We recognized orders of $17,376 million, $11,273 million, and $15,385 million, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Due to the nature of our business, including the time required to manufacture equipment and the long-term nature of many of its service contracts, there is a backlog of unfilled customer orders for equipment sales and services, which as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $21,022 million, $21,697 million, and $23,941 million, respectively. 
Our statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which “goods” is required to include all sales of tangible products and “services” must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown above, as well as in the orders and backlog charts included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 in this Form 10-K, we distinguish between “equipment” and “product services,” where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of its operations. We refer to “product services” simply as “services” within this Business section and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 in this Form 10-K.
Backlog is defined as unfilled customer orders for products and services believed to be firm. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.

MARKETS AND COMPETITION
We sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. Our sales force also uses its application engineers, field application engineers, service engineers, commercial and sales managers, and account executives to help deliver and provide customers with the best product and service solutions which BHGE can offer. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in the current year.
Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by produce line, as discussed below: 
Oilfield Services
Our OFS product line believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and availability, health, safety and environmental standards, technical proficiency and price. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices, fluctuations in the level of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets, general economic conditions, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations. While we may have contracts with customers that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period of time ranging from two to four years, our services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover our pricing of the products and services, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services. OFS product line competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton and Weatherford International. 
Oilfield Equipment 
Our OFE product line believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and on time delivery, health, safety and environmental standards, technical proficiency, availability of spare parts and price. Its strong track record of innovation enables OFE to enter into long-term, performance-based service agreements with our customers. In the SPS product line, the primary competitors of OFE include Schlumberger, TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions ASA, Proserv and Dril-Quip Inc. In the flexible pipe product line, competitors include TechnipFMC, National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Airborne, and Magma.

Primary competitors include Emerson, ABB, Schneider Electric, Fortive, Olympus, Comet Group, Honeywell Process Solutions, Roper Technology, Siemens, Spectris, Aspentech and OSISoft.
CONTRACTS
We conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements.
We enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer’s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances, such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers. 
We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors; the loss of or damage to their equipment and often that of their other contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole); and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while in our care, custody, and control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence or the negligence of our contractors, and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.
Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states such as Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, and New Mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes. These statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract, however, both the Texas and Louisiana anti-indemnity statutes include important exclusions. The Louisiana statute does not apply to property damage, and the Texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions, which include, among other things, loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of well control events. State law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties, including in some cases other contractors of our customers, may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. In all cases, deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process.
The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable, however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. There can be no 
BHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 6

assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, services, technology and other solutions, as well as the improvement of existing products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. For information regarding the total amount of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, see "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
In the OFS and OFE product lines, we continue to invest in products to develop capability, improve performance and reduce costs. In OFS, we invested in a range of formation evaluation capabilities and drilling services hardware. This included a new and cutting-edge line of drill bits with hydraulic actuators that offer customers improvements in reliability, efficiency and maintainability. In OFE, the recent focus has been to expand capability into deeper water, longer offsets and at higher pressures. Additionally, subsea power and processing is also an area in which we are investing, covering both pumping and compression. In the TPS product line, we continue to invest in continuous product improvement of reciprocating and centrifugal compressors, using advanced fluid dynamic simulation and advanced aeromechanics to improve capability, operability and efficiency of its centrifugal compressors family. DS continues to invest in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of oil and gas production operations. These systems integrate operational data from producing oil and gas facilities to deliver notifications and analytical reports to engineers so they can identify operational performance issues before they become significant, thus helping to prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our technology, brands and other intellectual property rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are owned by us, while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio are licensed to us by GE and third parties. We do not consider any individual patent or trademark to be material to our business operations.
In connection with the Transactions, GE entered into an IP cross-license agreement (the IP Cross-License Agreement) with BHGE LLC. GE agreed to perpetually license to BHGE LLC the right to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by GE (other than GE Digital) pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. BHGE LLC agreed to perpetually license to GE the right to use certain intellectual property rights pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. This license allows BHGE LLC to have continued rights to use some of GE’s intellectual property so that they can be leveraged pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. Any improvements to such intellectual property made or developed by BHGE LLC will be owned by BHGE LLC and licensed back to GE pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement and any improvements to such intellectual property made or developed by GE will be owned by GE and licensed to BHGE LLC. If we were to cease being a majority-owned subsidiary of GE, the licenses under the IP Cross-License Agreement are intended to survive. 
We have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe that protection of our patents, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement worldwide as we deem appropriate to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete. 
BHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 7

SEASONALITY
Our operations can be affected by seasonal weather, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below:

• | The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels. In Canada, the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels, which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter. 


• | Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our coastal and offshore drilling, or our customers’ operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.


• | Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.


• | Scheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the North Sea can reduce activity in the second and third quarters.


• | Many of our international oilfield customers increase orders for certain products and services in the fourth quarter.


• | Our process & pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter.


• | Our broader DS business typically experiences higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year.

RAW MATERIALS
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services.  The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel, titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks.  Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources, but may be subject to price volatility.  Market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials, and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials.  Our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices.
In addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers.  These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we had over 64,000 employees, of which the majority are outside the U.S. Approximately 11% of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar-type labor arrangements.
BHGE 2017 FORM 10-K | 8

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations with regard to air, land and water quality and other environmental matters. Regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.
We are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties. On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as "Superfund") imposes liability for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs. 
In some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is not yet available. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $82 million and $28 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our assurance programs.
