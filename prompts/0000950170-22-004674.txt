PART II
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 Shoe Carnival, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest family footwear retailers, providing the convenience of shopping at any of our store locations, our mobile apps or online. We offer customers a broad assortment of dress, casual and athletic footwear for the entire family with an emphasis on national name brands. We are an Indiana corporation that was initially formed in Delaware in 1993 and reincorporated in Indiana in 1996. References to “Shoe Carnival” and “Shoe Station” are to the individual banners, not the entire company. References to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Shoe Carnival, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
During fiscal 2021, we grew our net sales by 36% compared to fiscal 2020 and 28% compared to fiscal 2019. The diluted net income per share earned in fiscal 2021 of $5.42 exceeded the diluted net income per share earned during the last six years combined. See PART II, ITEM 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the trends impacting our fiscal 2021 operating results.
Our Banners
 Shoe Carnival
 Our Shoe Carnival retail concept is differentiated from competitors by our distinctive, fun and promotional marketing efforts. Shoe Carnival stores combine competitive pricing with a high-energy in-store environment that encourages customer participation. Unique features of our store experience include upbeat music, opportunities for customers to spin our iconic spin-n-win wheel, and a mic-person who runs in-store specials. These specials include contests and games and hot deals of the moment to encourage customers to take immediate advantage of our special, in-store pricing.
On average, our Shoe Carnival physical stores are approximately 10,900 square feet and carry inventory of approximately 25,700 pairs of shoes per location. Including e-commerce sales in close proximity to a physical store, our physical stores each generated an average of $3.5 million in annual sales in fiscal 2021 and over $300 per square foot. As of January 29, 2022, we operated 372 stores in 35 states and Puerto Rico under the Shoe Carnival banner and offered online shopping at www.shoecarnival.com.
Shoe Station
 On December 3, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of privately-held, family-owned Shoe Station, Inc. ("Shoe Station"). The Shoe Station assets were acquired for approximately $70.7 million, inclusive of customary adjustments which are not yet finalized, and funded with cash on hand. This acquisition was the first acquisition in our history. As of January 29, 2022, we operated 21 locations across the Southeast under the Shoe Station banner. The addition of this banner and retail locations creates a complementary retail platform to serve a broader family footwear customer base across both urban and suburban demographics and provides an additional near-term growth opportunity for us.
On average, our Shoe Station physical stores are approximately 16,700 square feet and carry an average inventory of 43,300 pairs of shoes per location. Due to the size of the stores and a targeted more affluent family footwear customer, these locations provide for a primary destination shopping experience. We will also offer online shopping under this banner at www.shoestation.com. Revenues attributed to the Shoe Station banner generated from the acquisition date through January 29, 2022 totaled $16.6 million. More information on the acquisition can be found in Note 3 - "Acquisition of Shoe Station" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Key Competitive Strengths
 We believe our financial success is due to a number of key competitive strengths that make our banners, Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station, destinations of choice for today’s retail consumer.
 

Distinctive shopping experience
Our staff is dedicated to customer service and assists and educates customers with the features and location of merchandise, as well as finding sizes, styles and colors. We believe our distinctive shopping experience gives us various competitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales; the building of a loyal, repeat customer base; the creation of word-of-mouth advertising; and enhanced sell-through of in-season goods. Similar customer experiences are reflected in our e-commerce platform through special promotions and limited time sales.
 Broad merchandise assortment
Our product assortment is comprised of on-trend branded and private label footwear for the entire family and includes dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes. Our physical stores carry shoes in two general categories – athletics and non-athletics with subcategories for men's, women's and children's shoes, as well as a broad range of accessories. Our e-commerce platform offers customers a large assortment of products in all categories of footwear with an increased depth of sizes and colors that may not be available in all stores. Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each store, there are differences between our store banners, and to some extent, there is further differentiation by store under each banner, reflecting each store’s unique demographics and customer interests. Our knowledge of these interests, combined with our vendor relationships and distribution process, allows us to react quickly to emerging trends or special events. Approximately 160 of our Shoe Carnival stores have athletic shops that highlight leading athletic brands. We expect to continue growing our "athletic shop" in-store concept across our fleet in the years ahead.
 Competitive pricing for our customers
 Our customer is primarily a moderate income, value-conscious consumer seeking name brand footwear across all ages, with our Shoe Station banner targeting a higher price point and more suburban customer. We believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand and private label merchandise at competitive prices, we generate broad customer appeal. Additionally, the time-conscious customer appreciates the convenience of one-stop shopping for the entire family, whether this occurs at any of our store locations or through our other omnichannel choices.
Efficient store level cost structure
Our cost-efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively. We achieve low labor costs by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format, allowing customers to serve themselves, if they choose. This reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales. We locate our Shoe Carnival stores predominantly in open-air shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value-conscious shoppers. Our Shoe Station stores are primary destinations and thus many are standalone structures within high traffic shopping districts. We continue to invest in our existing store locations and expect to have our store modernization program complete by the end of fiscal 2024. By the end of fiscal 2022, we plan to be nearly half complete with our modernization plans.
 Heavy reliance on information technology growth strategy
 We have invested significant resources in information technology. Our proprietary inventory management and advanced point-of-sale (“POS”) systems provide corporate management, buyers and store managers with the timely information necessary to monitor and control all phases of operations. The POS provides, in addition to other features, full price management (including price look-up), promotion tracking capabilities (in support of the spontaneous nature of the in-store price promotions), real-time sales and cost of sales by product category at the store level and customer tracking. Using the POS, store personnel and centralized merchandising staff are able to monitor sales, cost of sales, and the success of product promotions in real-time.
Our centralized network connects our corporate office to our distribution center and retail stores via a wide area network, providing up-to-date sales and inventory information as required. Our data warehouse enables our merchandising and store operations staff to analyze sales, margin and inventory levels by location, by day, down to the size of shoe. Using this information, our merchandise managers meet regularly with vendors to compare their product sales and margins and return on inventory investment against previously stated objectives. We believe timely


access to key business data has enabled us to drive our comparable store sales, manage our markdown activity and improve inventory turnover.
 In fiscal 2020, we implemented new Transportation, Warehouse and Order Management Systems (“TMS”, “WMS”, “OMS”, respectively). These cloud-based, software-as-a-service arrangements have enabled us to meet the complex demands of omnichannel fulfillment, enhanced our supply chain, positioned us for long-term growth and ultimately enhanced customer satisfaction and convenience in an increasingly competitive and changing environment, and we believe further benefits will be achieved.
Disciplined Approach to Capital Management
 We remain focused on funding our operations and any future acquisitions similar to the Shoe Station acquisition without leverage. We ended fiscal 2021 with no debt and $132.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, even after funding the purchase of Shoe Station with cash on hand during our fiscal fourth quarter. Over the last five fiscal years, we have had no debt outstanding and cash and cash equivalents of at least $48 million at the end of each fiscal year. We believe this approach increases our ability to make impactful long-term decisions and enhances our stakeholder relationships.
 Growth Strategy
Store portfolio
 Increasing market penetration by adding new stores is expected to reemerge as a key component of our growth strategy. Through a combination of both organic and acquired store growth, we aim to add more than 10 new stores in fiscal 2022, over 20 new stores in fiscal 2023, and over 25 new stores annually by fiscal 2024, across both banners. We believe our current store footprint provides for growth to new markets within the United States as well as fill-in opportunities within existing markets. In the near term, we expect to pursue fill-in opportunities for store growth across large and mid-size markets as we continue to leverage customer data from our customer relationship management (“CRM”) program. Our CRM program is more fully described below under “Omnichannel Strategy – Customer Relationship Management.” We believe more attractive real estate options will be available with the addition of the Shoe Station retail concept to our portfolio. However, our future store growth may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty. We opened one new Shoe Carnival branded store in fiscal 2021.
Over the last several years, we performed a store improvement plan. As part of the plan, which is now complete, we identified underperforming stores and worked to address these stores' performance through renegotiation of lease terms, relocation, or closure. We closed 31 stores over the last three years, 12 of which were closed in fiscal 2021. While we continue to actively monitor the store portfolio, we do not expect any further significant closures over the next several years.
As of January 29, 2022, we leased our 393 stores located across 35 states and Puerto Rico. New store sizes typically depend upon location and population base, and our stores are predominantly located in open-air shopping centers. Our traditional Shoe Carnival store prototype typically utilizes between 8,000 and 12,000 square feet of leased space and our Shoe Station store prototype utilizes between 12,000 to 20,000 square feet of leased space. The sales area comprises substantially all (greater than 80 percent) of our typical gross store footprint.

Before entering a new market, we perform a market, demographic and competition analysis to evaluate the suitability of the potential market. Potential store site selection criteria include, among other factors, market demographics, traffic counts, tenant mix, visibility within the center and from major thoroughfares, overall retail activity of the area and proposed lease terms.
Omnichannel Strategy
 Our goal is to be a world class multi-billion dollar omnichannel retailer. The foundation of our omnichannel strategy is providing customers easy access to our wide assortment of merchandise via their choice of device and delivery channel. We are committed to providing a personalized, seamless customer experience across all channels, and we believe that our ongoing omnichannel initiatives are aligned with rapidly changing consumer behavior.
Customer Relationship Management
Our CRM program continues to provide valuable customer insights to our business, resulting in more efficient and effective marketing outreach. CRM provides our marketing, merchandising, analytics and real estate teams a better and more complete view of our customer’s shopping behaviors and forms the foundation of our digital marketing efforts and our Shoe Perks loyalty program (“Shoe Perks”). Our view into customer data allows us to more effectively communicate with our customers on a segmented basis through all owned and paid media channels and tailor the merchandise mix down to a store level. Through transaction data, we gain useful insights into our customers’ shopping habits, including where, when and how they shop our stores and navigate our online presence. Additionally, our CRM program allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the brands and categories that our high-value customers consistently purchase so that we can continue to deliver strong performance at a geographic and store level.
   Our CRM program allows us to drive customer retention by delivering each customer more individualized shopping opportunities and experiences and aids in gaining a better understanding of our existing customer base as well as identifying new customers. We expect segmentation and activation of our high-value customers through data analysis and targeting the broader market of ‘look-a-like’ customers to continue to play a key role in our growth.

Once a customer enrolls in Shoe Perks and provides a means for digital communication, the customer will begin receiving personalized communications from us. These communications afford us additional opportunities to highlight our broad product assortment and promotions. Shoe Perks provides customers with a heightened shopping


experience, which includes exclusive offers and rewards that are earned by making purchases either in-store or online and through participating in other point earning opportunities that facilitate engagement with our brand.
We remain focused on expanding our Shoe Perks enrollment. In fiscal 2021, our Shoe Perks membership grew to 28.5 million members. Purchases from Shoe Perks members were approximately 68% of our comparable net sales. We believe our Shoe Perks program affords us tremendous opportunity to communicate, build relationships, and engage with our most loyal shoppers and increase our customer touch points, which we believe will result in long-term sales gains. Our most loyal customers, those who qualify for our “Gold” tier, receive additional rewards and incentives. The average transaction value for our Gold tier customers was approximately 47% higher than non-Gold tier Shoe Perks members in fiscal 2021.
E-commerce Platform
 Our e-commerce platform is an extension of our physical stores and is designed to improve the customer journey by providing a more relevant and personalized shopping experience. Our e-commerce platform played a critical role in fiscal 2020 due to the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2020, our customers embraced our e-commerce platform as demand for online shopping surged, and we exceeded our e-commerce sales expectations. In fiscal 2021, e-commerce sales moderated as restrictions were lifted and consumer confidence related to in-person shopping returned. We continue to expect our e-commerce platform to be a significant sales channel for us. E-commerce sales represented approximately 12% of our merchandise sales in fiscal 2021, 19% in fiscal 2020 and 6% in fiscal 2019.
 Ship-From-Store
 Our Ship-From-Store program is a core element of our omnichannel strategy. This program allows stores to fulfill online orders and has been implemented on a chain-wide basis (with limited exceptions). By fulfilling e-commerce orders principally from our store level inventory, we are able to minimize out-of-stocks, offer our customers an expanded online assortment and leverage store level inventory and overhead. E-commerce orders are also fulfilled from our distribution center in Evansville, Indiana.
Vendor Drop-Ship Program
 We maintain a vendor drop-ship program with select business partners. This program offers our customers an expanded online assortment of styles and colors that we do not carry in-store. While our customers benefit from expanded item assortment, the functionality of this program is seamless, and our customers’ online experience is not impacted by the vendor drop-ship fulfillment option. We benefit from this program by not having to make a capital investment in the expanded inventory assortment, which is carried and fulfilled by our business partners participating in this program.
Other Omnichannel
 Other elements of our omnichannel strategy are our “buy online, pick up in store” program and our Shoes 2U program. Not only can our customers choose to pick up e-commerce orders in-store, but they can shop their favorite or nearby stores online and only see the product that is available in any given store. This program provides the convenience of local pickup for our customers or same day delivery through one of our business partners for online purchases made from a store in close proximity to the customer’s chosen delivery point.
 Our Shoes 2U program enables us to ship product from any store to a customer’s home or store of choice if the customer is unable to find the size, color or style of a shoe in the store being shopped. This creates an endless aisle experience for our customers in which our chain-wide inventory is accessible to any store customer.
 Merchandise
 Our stores and e-commerce platform offer a broad assortment of current-season, name brand footwear, supplemented with private label merchandise and accessories. Critical to our success is maintaining fresh, fashionable merchandise at the price points expected by our customers. Our buyers stay in touch with evolving fashion trends and adjust growth strategies based on these trends. This is accomplished by subscribing to an industry leading trend service, shopping


fashion-leading markets, attending national trade shows, gathering vendor input and monitoring the current styles shown in leading fashion and lifestyle magazines.
Our buyers and planners have years of experience and in-depth knowledge of our customers and the markets in which we operate. This helps us select our assortment and quantities in order to manage and allocate inventories at the store level. The mix of merchandise and the brands offered in a particular store reflect the demographics of each market, climate and seasonality, among other factors. Our e-commerce platform offers customers an opportunity to choose from a large selection of products in all of the same categories of footwear and introduces our concept to consumers who are new to our retail concepts, in both existing and new markets.
In fiscal 2020, we commenced implementation of a new merchandise planning system that provides a unified strategic planning and budgeting process that is supported by various solutions, including strategic and assortment planning, store allocation and replenishment and in-season management. This cloud-based platform is a multi-year project. We believe this collaborative platform will unify our buy plans, optimize inventory levels, help achieve more sales at higher margins and allow us to set goals for multiple channels and formats common in today’s competitive environment.
 Management of the purchasing function is the responsibility of our Senior Executive Vice President – Chief Merchandising Officer. Our buyers maintain ongoing communication with our vendors and provide feedback to our vendors on sales, profitability and demand. We adjust future purchasing decisions based upon the results of this analysis. Two branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and approximately 43% in fiscal 2020 (Nike, Inc. approximately 28% in fiscal 2021 and 33% in fiscal 2020 and Skechers USA, Inc. approximately 11% in fiscal 2021 and 10% in fiscal 2020). Name brand suppliers also provide us with cooperative advertising and visual merchandising funds. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long‑term contracts with our suppliers.
Initial pricing is typically established in accordance with the manufacturer’s suggested retail pricing structure. Subsequent to this initial pricing, our buying staff manages our markdown cadence based on product-specific sell-through rates to achieve liquidation of inventory within the natural lifecycle of the product. We emphasize our value proposition to customers by combining current season name brand products with marketing promotions. These promotions include both advertised limited time sale offerings in addition to in-store and online timed specials.
 The table below sets forth our percentage of sales by product category.

Building Brand Awareness
 Our goal is to communicate a consistent brand image for both of our banners across all aspects of our operations and throughout our marketing strategies. We highlight our banners and the merchandise brands we carry, including specific styles of product, using lifestyle and product imagery to showcase merchandise brands. The use of digital media continues to grow in importance in our marketing mix, particularly as we leverage data that comes directly


from our customers as part of our CRM solution, allowing us to directly communicate with our core customers. In fiscal 2021, our advertising spend was directed primarily to digital media. Television, radio, print media (including inserts, direct mail and newspaper advertising) and outdoor advertising accounted for the balance of our total advertising budget.
Distribution
 We operate a single 410,000 square foot distribution center located in Evansville, Indiana. Our facility can support the processing and distribution needs for up to 460 stores based on our current configuration. We have the right to expand the facility by 200,000 square feet, which would provide us processing capacity to support approximately 650 stores. We lease the facility from a third party, which expires in 2034.
Our distribution center is equipped with mechanized processing and product movement equipment. The facility utilizes cross docking/store replenishment and redistribution methods to fill store product requirements. These methods may include count verification, price and bar code labeling of each unit (when not performed by the manufacturer), redistribution of an order into size assortments (when not performed by the manufacturer) and allocation of shipments to individual stores. Throughout packing, allocating, storing and shipping, our distribution process is essentially paperless. Merchandise is typically shipped to each store location once per week. For stores within the continental United States, a dedicated carrier, with occasional use of common carriers, handles the majority of shipments.
Competition
The retail footwear business is highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are merchandise selection, price, fashion, quality, location, shopping environment and service. We compete with department stores, shoe stores, sporting goods stores, e-commerce retailers and mass merchandisers. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We compete with most department stores and traditional shoe stores by offering competitive prices. We compete with off-price retailers, mass merchandisers and discount stores by offering a wider and deeper selection of merchandise. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. However, we believe that our distinctive retail formats, in combination with our wide merchandise selection, competitive prices, low operating costs, and strong balance sheet with no debt enable us to compete effectively.
Store Operations
 Management of store operations is the responsibility of our Executive Vice President - Chief Retail Operations Officer. Generally, each store has a general manager and additional store managers depending on sales volume and is overseen and supported by a district manager. Store operations personnel make certain merchandising decisions necessary to maximize sales and profits primarily through merchandise placement, signage and timely clearance of slower selling items. We are increasingly deploying digital display devices throughout our stores allowing signage to be controlled centrally. Administrative functions are centralized at our corporate headquarters. These functions include accounting, strategic sourcing, store maintenance, information systems, marketing, human resources, distribution and pricing. Management oversight for e-commerce is also located at our corporate headquarters.
Culture and Human Capital Management
 We have intentionally built an employee-centric, customer-focused organization designed to compete at the highest levels in the retail industry. Our commitment to, and investment in, a strong performance culture is paramount to our long-term sustainability and success. Our employee-centric culture aided us during the COVID-19 pandemic. As non-essential retailers were required to close to the public, many of our competitors decided to furlough a significant number of employees. We, however, took a different route, finding innovative ways to keep our associates in full employment. This strategy positively impacted our associates, their families, and the communities we serve. In addition, this decision enabled us to rapidly reopen our stores in a safe manner as soon as we were permitted to do so.
Workforce Diversity and Inclusion
 We serve a diverse customer base and seek diversity in and among our workforce in all areas, from our stores to our distribution center and our corporate office. We believe that the diversity of our workforce and management is a tremendous asset. We are firmly committed to providing equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and believe that all individuals should be treated with respect and dignity. Diversity is an important element in our ongoing annual mandatory training for all employees and managers. We do not tolerate harassment or unlawful discrimination of any kind.
We have clear policies encouraging strong relationships and protecting open lines of communication with management at every level. This, coupled with our non-retaliation policy, encourages employees to raise issues and seek immediate redress of those issues if they should arise.
We understand the value of diversity at all levels, whether of gender, race, ethnicity, background or experience. As of January 29, 2022, our workforce identified as 63% female and 37% male. Our broad-based leadership team, including those who manage and lead our stores and those who lead our Company, identified as 60% female and 40% male. With respect to ethnicity, our leadership team identified as 60% Caucasian and 40% non-Caucasian. The diversity of our leadership team trends with the diversity of our customer base, which based on recent data from our Shoe Perks customer loyalty program, approximates two-thirds Caucasian and one-third African American, Hispanic, or Asian and is more female than male.
 In our corporate leadership roles (senior director-level employees through our named executive officers), the portion identifying as female has significantly increased over the last four years from 5% to 27%. Our human resources, marketing, and supply chain departments, as well as portions of our merchandising and technology departments, are led by those that identify as female.
 At the Board level, we are also focused on increasing our diversity. Currently 40% of our non-employee Board members are female, up from 20% last year. We are continuing to refresh our Board and assess long-term succession as well as the diversity of the Board’s collective skill set. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, two total board members exited our Board as their terms expired, creating space for new directors who have enhanced our diversity.
 
Retention
 We believe our employee-centric culture not only supports higher levels of execution and performance, but also has led to increased retention of key talent. We take great pride in our store-level training programs that provide the foundation for long-term careers and our ability to promote from within. We are proud to support the first-time jobs for many of our associates where they gain workforce experiences that may grow into long-term careers with us, with others, or the skills to open their own business.
 Currently, all of the general managers who operate our Shoe Carnival bannered stores and 90% of our district managers who oversee those general managers were trained, developed, and promoted from within. As of January 29, 2022, of our 28 district managers, 64% have been employed for more than 20 years. The average tenure of the general managers who operate our Shoe Carnival bannered stores was 13 years as of fiscal 2021 year end.
 Individuals who comprise our leadership team, which includes our named executive officers, vice presidents and senior director-level employees, have been employed by Shoe Carnival or Shoe Station for an average of 18 years.
 
Employee Benefits
 Among the many ways we seek to serve our employees, we offer a complete range of benefits. These include competitive wages and incentives, including stock appreciation rights for mid-level managers; an employee stock purchase plan with a discount off the fair value of our common stock; employer-subsidized medical plans with dental and vision benefits; qualified and unqualified defined contribution plans with employer matching contributions; and merchandise discounts, among other benefits.
Training and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 We are dedicated to strengthening our culture and execution through ongoing training for all associates. We are uniquely focused on training within our store-level, customer-facing operations. Employees must obtain necessary certifications in order to be responsible for the keys to a store and eventually to become a general manager. Our broad-based training program also engages and educates our employees on the following key topics:
 •Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Ethics”);
 •Non-discrimination and anti-harassment, including the value of diversity and awareness of bias in all aspects of the employment relationship;
 •Cybersecurity awareness and responsibility; and
 •Supply chain security.
 More information regarding our approach to conducting business responsibly, including our guidelines on discrimination and harassment, can be found in our Code of Ethics. Our Code of Ethics applies to all of our Board members, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, and our principal accounting officer.
Our Code of Ethics is posted on our website at investors.shoecarnival.com/governance/governance-documents. We intend to disclose any amendments to the Code of Ethics by posting such amendments on our website. In addition, any waivers of the Code of Ethics for our Board members or executive officers will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Safety of our Employees and Security of our Data
 We strive to provide our associates with a safe and healthy work environment. We measure OSHA recordable incidents to gauge the success of our safety protocol. During calendar year 2021, we recorded 51 non COVID-related OSHA recordable incidents, an approximate 20% reduction in incidents compared to three years ago.
Our strategies to address the ever-expanding complexities of protecting customer and employee data and executing our business strategies in an increasingly digital world continue to advance. Our technology department monitors and regularly tests compliance with our protocols, provides regular updates to employees and management, and conducts annual training.
 
Number of Employees
 At January 29, 2022, we had approximately 5,800 employees, of which approximately 3,200 were employed on a part-time basis. The number of employees fluctuates during the year primarily due to seasonality. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
Seasonality
 For a discussion of the impact of seasonality on our operating results and our business, see PART II, ITEM 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Store Count and Seasonality on Quarterly Results.”
