(“Insight” or the “Company”) empowers organizations with technology, solutions and services to help our clients maximize the value of their IT today and drive (digital) transformation for tomorrow in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). As a Fortune 500-ranked global technology provider of end-to-end secure digital transformation solutions and services, we help clients innovate and optimize their operations to run smarter. 
The Company is organized in the following three operating segments, which are primarily defined by their related geographies:

Operating Segment* | Geography | Percent of 2021Consolidated Net Sales
North America | United States and Canada | 80% 
EMEA | Europe, Middle East and Africa | 18% 
APAC | Asia-Pacific | 2% 

*Additional detailed segment and geographic information can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Insight began operations in Arizona in 1988, incorporated in Delaware in 1991 and completed its initial public offering in 1995. Our corporate headquarters are located in Tempe, Arizona. From our original location in the United States, we expanded nationwide and then entered Canada in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 1998. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, we continued to increase our geographic coverage and expand our technical capabilities. Our acquisitions were as follows: 
Prior to 2017 we acquired Software Spectrum, Inc. (2006), Calence, LLC (2008), MINX Limited (2008), Ensynch, Inc. (2011), Inmac GmbH (2012) and Micro Warehouse BV (2012), BlueMetal Architects, Inc. (2015) and Ignia, Pty Ltd (2016).
Our acquisitions from 2017 through today were as follows: 
•2017 – Acquired Datalink Corporation (“Datalink”) and strengthened our position as a leading IT solutions provider with deep technical expertise delivering data center transformation solutions to clients on premise or in the cloud. Additionally, we acquired Caase Group B.V. (referred to herein as, “Caase.com”) and strengthened our ability to deliver cloud solutions to our clients in EMEA; 
•2018 – Acquired Cardinal Solutions Group, Inc. (“Cardinal”), a digital solutions provider and strengthened our digital innovations capabilities;
•2019 – Acquired PCM, Inc. (“PCM”), a provider of multi-vendor technology offerings, including hardware, software and services which complemented our supply chain expertise, adding scale and clients in the commercial space primarily in North America; and

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

Our Purpose and Values
Our purpose: We build meaningful connections to help businesses run smarter. We live by our core values of hunger, heart and harmony, which set the tone for our business and define who we are.
Our core values are:
Hunger – We are change agents, united in our passion to improve every day and deliver outstanding results for our clients, partners and Insight.
Heart – We are teammates. We take care of each other, our clients and our communities.
Harmony – We are a team of diverse individuals who value inclusivity and create meaningful connections so we can win together.
We believe that these values strengthen the overall Insight experience for our clients, partners and teammates. We refer to our customers as “clients,” our suppliers as “partners” and our employees as “teammates”.
Our Market
The worldwide total addressable market for information technology is forecasted to be $4.1 trillion according to Gartner, a leading IT research and advisory company. We believe our worldwide addressable market represents approximately $700 billion in annual sales and for the year ended December 31, 2021, our net sales of $9.4 billion represented approximately 1% of that highly diverse market. Based on our analysis of Gartner market data, we believe the top 10 most comparable global solution providers represent less than 10% of our worldwide addressable market. We believe that we are well positioned in this highly fragmented global market with locations in 19 countries and our deep experience delivering IT solutions across the globe. 
Our Differentiated Strategy
Our clients are our number-one priority, so delivering client value, which helps us earn client loyalty, is our primary goal. We expect our clients to achieve advantages by leveraging our unique capabilities to provide end-to-end secure digital transformation solutions and services. From IT strategy and design to implementation and management, we meet clients wherever they are now, and work alongside them to get them to where they want to be. 
Whether implementing public cloud or as-a-service workplace solutions, designing a next-generation or hybrid cloud data center or leveraging sophisticated Internet-of-Things ("IoT") and artificial intelligence solutions to improve our clients’ experiences, we provide technical expertise and advisory services to our clients as an industry-recognized solutions integrator.
Our go-to-market framework for our cloud and digital expertise is built on over 33 years of broad IT experience combined with strategic acquisitions, new cloud and digital expertise and deep partner relationships. We are uniquely positioned to help our clients maximize the values of their technology today – and accelerate tomorrow.
Each of our areas of expertise represents a discrete area of growth for our business and when connected to each other, they provide a platform for our clients to leverage our breadth of expertise to solve their most relevant business challenges. Our strategy is to increase our penetration with new and existing clients within the areas of expertise across our geographic footprint in North America, EMEA and APAC. Powered by Insight’s legacy technology supply chain expertise, we are able to support our services offerings within the hardware, software and cloud solutions from market-leading and emerging manufacturer brands. To execute our strategy, we employ centralized and field-based sales, engineering, and services resources to connect with our clients. We also invested in technical engineers, architects and software developers who create and deliver integrated IT solutions to our clients globally, a capability we believe differentiates us in the marketplace.

Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments consist of largely software and certain software-related services and cloud solutions. On a consolidated basis, hardware, software and services represented approximately 62%, 24% and 14%, respectively, of our net sales in 2021. This compares to 61%, 25% and 14%, respectively, of our net sales in 2020 and 60%, 27% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2019. Additional detailed sales mix information 
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

by operating segment can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
Our Information Technology Systems
We have committed significant resources to the IT systems that we own and use to manage our business and believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients based on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems. Because these systems affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, partner relationships, distribution, inventories, accounting systems and internal networks, we have significantly improved our system security through investment in a highly skilled and tenured cybersecurity team as well as the implementation of the most up to date tools and processes to help harden and improve our cybersecurity defenses.
We are focused on driving improvements in sales productivity through increased innovation and enhancements to our e-commerce and IT systems with the goals of improved client satisfaction and attracting new clients, while increasing overall business efficiency.
In North America and APAC we use a common set of core IT applications to run our business. In 2021, we began consolidating EMEA onto the same core systems beginning with the United Kingdom. After the successful migration of our UK operations onto the global platform in 2021, the full migration of the remaining countries in Europe was completed in January 2022.
For a discussion of risks associated with our IT systems, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Technology, Data and Intellectual Property – Disruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Our Competition
The IT hardware, software and services industry is very fragmented and highly competitive. Our competition includes:
•Solution providers, value-added resellers and direct marketers such as CDW, Zones, Connection, SHI, Softchoice, Systemax, Computacenter, Bechtle, SoftwareONE, and Crayon;
•Systems integrators such as ePlus, Presidio, World Wide Technology, Perficient and Accenture;
•Product manufacturers, such as Dell, HP Inc., IBM, Lenovo and HPE;
•Software publishers, such as Red Hat, VMware, Microsoft and Symantec;
•National and global service providers, such as IBM Global Services and HP Enterprise Services; and
•Specialty retailers, aggregators, distributors and e-tailers, such as Amazon Web Services, Best Buy for Business, Newegg and e-Buyer (United Kingdom).
The competitive landscape in the industry is continually changing as various competitors expand their product and services offerings. In addition, emerging models such as cloud computing and X as-a-service are creating new competitors and opportunities in the shift to digital business such as: data analytics, edge computing, hybrid infrastructure, modern workplace, cybersecurity, and other service offerings. As with other areas, we compete with solutions providers, systems integrators, value-added resellers, hyperscale vendors and directly with publishers, and manufacturer partners for many of these offerings. Many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers.
For a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Business, Operations and Industry – The IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
Our Partners
We partner with market leaders offering the top technology brands as well as emerging entrants in the marketplace. During 2021, we purchased products and software from approximately 2,600 partners. Approximately 60% (based on dollar volume) of these purchases were directly from manufacturers or software publishers, with the balance purchased through distributors. Purchases from Microsoft, TD Synnex (a distributor) and Ingram Micro (a distributor) accounted for approximately 22%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2021. No other partner accounted for more than 10% of 
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

purchases in 2021. Our top five partners as a group for 2021 were Microsoft, TD Synnex (a distributor), Ingram Micro (a distributor), Dell, and Cisco Systems, and approximately 60% of our total purchases during 2021 came from this group of partners. Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of our product categories such that, with the exception of Microsoft, we are not dependent on any single partner for sourcing products. 
During 2021, sales of Microsoft and Dell products accounted for approximately 16% and 10%, respectively of our consolidated net sales. No other manufacturer’s or publisher’s products accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2021. Sales of product from our top five manufacturers/publishers as a group (Microsoft, Dell, Cisco Systems, HP Inc. and Lenovo) accounted for approximately 50% of our consolidated net sales during 2021. 
We obtain incentives from certain product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners based typically upon the volume of sales or purchases of their products and services. In other cases, such incentives may be in the form of participation in our partner programs, which may require specific services or activities with our clients, discounts, marketing funds, price protection or rebates. Manufacturers and publishers may also provide mailing lists, contacts or leads to us. We believe that these incentives (or partner funding) and other marketing assistance allow us to increase our marketing reach and strengthen our relationships with leading manufacturers and publishers. 
We are focused on understanding our partners’ objectives and developing plans and programs to grow our mutual businesses. We have invested in our digital marketing capabilities over the past five years. These digital marketing investments increase the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and client interactions. We believe that we are emerging as a leader in our industry in digital marketing, striving to deliver an outstanding service experience to our clients. We implemented business intelligence tools that enable us to track performance in this area and demonstrate the return on our partners’ investments with us. We measure partner satisfaction regularly and hold quarterly business reviews with our largest partners to review business results from the prior quarter, discuss plans for the future and obtain feedback. Additionally, we host annual partner forums in North America, EMEA and APAC to articulate our plans for the upcoming year.
As we move into new service areas, we may become even more reliant on certain partner relationships. For a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on partners, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Business, Operations and Industry – We rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Our Teammates
Successful execution of our business strategy and strategic initiatives involves attracting, developing and retaining teammates who share our core values of hunger, heart and harmony. The experience, knowledge and dedication of our teammates help drive our operating results. Management regularly evaluates and enhances leadership training and development, teammate policies, procedures and benefits in order to maintain engaged teammates and drive client satisfaction. 
Various ways that we attract, develop and retain qualified and motivated teammates include:
•Insight continues to make strides in its employer of choice journey and has received honors all around the globe. Some examples include: Forbes World’s Best Employers list (2021) - Insight ranked #95 overall, #12 for IT companies worldwide, #140 for Diversity (2021) and #62 for Veterans (2020); #3 for UK Best Workplaces (2021); #15 for Australia’s Best Places to Work (2021); #4 on Phoenix Best Places to Work – Phoenix Business Journal (2021); Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index perfect score of 100 (2022); “Elite 8” on Achiever’s 50 Most Engaged Workplaces (2021); #70 on the Fortune 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity list (2019); and #7 in the information technology services industry on the list of the Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies list (2021).
•Insight offers robust leadership training for all teammate managers and aspiring leaders. Our training is centered around our Leadership Commitments where we enhance our leader’s skills in the following areas: (1) Create clarity; (2) Inspire people; (3) Demonstrate thought leadership; and (4) Deliver results. We believe leaders who excel in these commitments heighten teammate satisfaction and deliver superior business results. 
•An important part of the Company’s culture is its commitment to diversity and inclusion, and we’ve been recognized for our dedication to this important area. Insight supports 7 Teammate Resource Groups, which represent various diverse groups of teammates and boasts 1,300+ 
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

active members. These 7 groups, and our Diversity & Inclusion team, host 10+ events per month including (but not limited to) cultural celebrations, Allyship & Unconscious Bias training, guest speakers, and wellness events. 
•Our Teammate Pulse Survey has ranked Diversity as our #1 scoring category for the past four years. In the Fortune Best Workplaces process, we learned that “Justice” was rated as the highest category by our teammates – the extent to which employees perceive that management promotes inclusive behavior, avoids discrimination, and is committed to providing fair appeal.
•Our leaders carefully review and monitor our Teammate Pulse Survey results year over year and create action plans to increase teammate engagement. We have seen positive trending over the last five years and are proud of the culture at Insight.
•To support teammates and their families in crisis situations, the Company provides financial support through its charitable foundation, which has received millions in contributions over the last seven years from Insight, its teammates and its partners.
•Insight offers all teammates two paid Heart Days annually to volunteer their time to charitable organizations in the communities where they live and work.
•Insight also has trained Mental Health First Aid Certified teammates throughout the business globally in order to ensure our teammates have easy access points to the resources we have available to them and their family members.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 11,624 teammates. Our teammates by operating segment were as follows: 

Operating Segment | Number of Teammates
North America | 9,260 
EMEA | 1,914 
APAC | 450 

Our teammates in the United States are not represented by a labor union. Our work forces in certain foreign countries, such as Germany, have worker representative committees or work councils with which we maintain strong relationships. We believe our relations with our teammates are good, and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage. 
Our teammates by job function were as follows:

Job Function | Number of Teammates
Sales | 3,670 
Skilled, certified consulting and service delivery professionals | 4,612 
Total sales and client facing teammates | 8,282 
Management, support services and administration | 2,955 
Distribution | 387 

For a discussion of risks associated with our dependence on certain personnel, including sales personnel, see “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – We depend on certain key personnel,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Our Seasonality
We experience some seasonal trends in our sales of hardware, software and services. For example:
•software sales are typically higher in our second and fourth quarters, particularly the second quarter;
•business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend more in our fourth quarter and less in the first quarter; 
•sales to the federal government in the United States are often stronger in our third quarter, while sales in the state and local government and education markets are stronger in our second quarter; and
•sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often stronger in our first quarter.
These trends create overall seasonality in our consolidated results such that sales and profitability are expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year. 
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

Our Backlog
The majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders. Our backlog has grown significantly in the past year, primarily as a result of our client's responses to supply chain constraints. We expect the supply chain constraints may not be fully alleviated in 2022 but our elevated backlog exiting the fourth quarter of 2021 will benefit the first half of 2022. We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results. 
Our Intellectual Property
We do not maintain a traditional research and development group, but we recognize the importance of intellectual property and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. As part of our business, we provide value to clients based, in part, on our proprietary innovations, methodologies, reusable know-how and other intellectual property assets, that we protect through different forms of intellectual property protection, including trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other protections in the United States and select foreign countries where we believe it is appropriate to seek such protection, under applicable laws. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by non-disclosure policies and agreements, as applicable, with teammates, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringers in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in our industry and uncertainties in the legal process makes our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees. A valuable intellectual property asset is our Insight brand which is a registered trademark. We also license certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights to third parties. We have registered a number of domain names, applied for registration of other marks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, and, from time to time, filed patent applications. We believe our trademarks, in particular, have significant value, and we continue to invest in their promotion and protection. 
For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors – We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
