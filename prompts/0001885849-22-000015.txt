Item 1. Description of Business
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
In General 
 
Tofla Megaline was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 31, 2018. Tofla Megaline has only one officer and director who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo. We are a development stage Company and operate in the business of software development for robotic devices. We plan to provide easy-to-use, high quality and cost-effective automation AI solutions. Tofla Megaline will be focusing on both stand-alone and integrated solutions in order to cover a broader selection of services, especially in the surveillance area. Using autonomous robotic units as a means of surveillance is a new tendency all over the globe. Robotic units can be used for patrolling warehouses, malls, backyards, office areas and buildings etc. Our focus is going to be developing specialized software for the units that will cover all the necessary functionality for surveillance and data transfer. We intend to engage in business activity, however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in developing our marketable product.
 We intend to design and operate our systems as a solution to be integrated with already existing control equipment and security systems, or separately as standalone versions. We are also planning to extend the diversity of our products and develop software for service industry, like delivery services or health care. Our initial steps will be developing software which is easily integrated into existing security and video surveillance systems as well as custom solutions in addition to existing surveillance systems. We also consider developing software which can be programmed to move in a given direction for long distances, make time reminders, respond to voices, recognize and complete commands.
 Software Description 
 
Robotic units using Tofla’s intended software are going to be programmed to follow specific routes while recording current situation with built-in cameras and analyzing it. Inner systems will use infrared lighting to allow the camera to take the picture at any time of the day and sensitive microphones for the most accurate recording of all sounds. Visual and audio data will be streamed to responsible personnel in real time and also recorded for storage at a remote server. The units will be able to detect security violations and send notifications or pursue trespassers in order to identify and gather their parameters which may then be used for law enforcement purposes. The units will be capable of giving warnings using light and audio.
 
Tofla software will enable robots to operate both indoors and outdoors on different surfaces. Such robots may be easily stored at any location when not needed. However, their main focus will be patrolling shopping centers, supermarkets, parking lots, large Company offices, educational institutions, warehouses, private property and other locations. Depending on customers’ requirements we are planning to install additional functions and tune the standard ones.

Potential clients 
 
We plan to offer our product to owners of big spaces such as parking lots, shopping malls, factories, corporate facilities, warehouses, restricted areas, private areas, airports, stations, educational and state institutions.
 Marketing 
 We believe that the key marketing strategy for our type of business is online marketing. We plan to advertise our Company on the Internet via Google AdWords and Yahoo Ad Manager technologies using several online marketing strategies to attract users to our promotional website. It is going to contain information about the software we will develop, its applicable features, advantages and contact information. Tofla Megaline is also going to create and maintain profiles in social networking websites like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
 We intend to maintain an extensive marketing campaign that will ensure maximum visibility for the business in its target market. We plan to sell our software through direct emails, phone calls, business meetings and corporate presentations as well. Our sole officer and director, Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, will be responsible for marketing of our product. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of customers to buy our software, there is no guarantee that it will cover our costs and that we will be able to retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. We will rely heavily on our clients recommending our technology to others in our target market.
 
Competition 
 
Software development market is rapidly growing day by day and there is a big number of companies operating in this domain. Our key feature is developing software for security purposes, ranging from surveillance and transferring visual data to a remote server to pursuing potential trespassers. Entry level barriers of the industry are relatively low and accessible which leads to an extremely high level of competition. We believe there are not too many developers of security software in Mexico and there is a niche to be occupied. We intend to focus and attend to individual needs of each of our potential clients.
Insurance 
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees. 
 
We are a development stage Company and currently have 1 (one) employee who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, our sole officer and director. We may hire employees on an as needed basis following the process of implementing our business plan.
