Business Units
 
We have two business units, Connected Solutions and MVNO. The Connected Solutions BU develops wireless smart connected devices and cloud solutions. The MVNO BU operates a mobile virtual network in China that provides a full range of 2G/3G/4G mobile communication services at the consumer level and some traditional commercial telephony services.
 
Borqs provides Connected Solutions customers with customized, integrated, commercial grade Android platform software and service solutions to address vertical market segment needs through the targeted BorqsWare software platform solutions. The BorqsWare software platform consists of BorqsWare Client Software and BorqsWare Server Software. The BorqsWare Client Software platform consists of three major components: the latest commercial grade Android software that works with particular mobile chipsets, functionality enhancements of the open source Android software and mobile operator required services. Based on the BorqsWare Client Software platform, customers may require Borqs to provide further customization based on their specific market needs. The BorqsWare Client Software platform has been used in Android phones, tablets, watches and various Internet-of-things (“IoT”) devices. The BorqsWare Server Software platform consists of back-end server software that allows customers to develop their own mobile end-to-end services for their devices. The BorqsWare Server Software provides software necessary for upgrades, charging and various APIs that enhance the customers’ services. Based on BorqsWare Server Software service platform, customers may require us to provide further customization based on their specific needs.
 
The MVNO BU provides a full range 2G/3G/4G voice and data services for general consumer usage and IoT devices, as well as traditional telecom services such as voice conferencing. The MVNO BU also acts as a sales and promotion channel for the products developed by the Connected Solutions BU. Borqs believes that a key component of the sales of connected devices going forward is the bundling of those devices with a voice/data plan through its MVNO BU. The MVNO BU launched operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. The MVNO BU provides services throughout China. Borqs had more than two million registered subscribers at the end of 2015, approximately 4.5 million at the end of 2016, and approximately 5.37 million at the end of 2017.
 
The MVNO BU provides bundled voice and data services to Chinese consumers, serving as the principal in doing so and recognizing revenue on a gross basis. As sales of bundled services are mostly pre-paid by the consumers, cash received in advance of voice and data consumption are recognized as deferred revenue. Revenue is recognized when the services are actually used. Pre-paid bundled services do not expire. Sales of the bundles are mostly made through agents and franchisees. Bundled services sold to agents are discounted and not refundable to Borqs; and such discounts are recorded as reductions of revenue. We enter into profit sharing arrangements with franchisees under which bundled services may be returned if not sold to the consumers. The franchisees receive certain percentages of profits made by Borqs on the sales of the bundled services as they are used by the consumers. We account for profit sharing with franchisees as selling expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to the Company’s policy, the amount of discounts that may be provided by the franchisees to consumers is capped at 5%, based on which, we recognized the maximum amount of discounts that may be provided by the franchisees as reductions of revenue.

Solutions 
 

The Connected Solutions BU helps customers design, develop and realize the commercialization of their connected devices. The MVNO BU helps customers deploy their devices in China with 2G/3G/4G cellular connectivity with flexible voice/data plan.
 
Ideation & Design — Based on customer requirements on the type of connected device the customer want to have, we can help customers design the product ID and user interface. We have the design engineering to provide 2D/3D rendering. The Company can provide physical mockup with different color, material and finishes, so the customer can hold and “feel” the mockup before finalizing the product ID.
 
Software IP Development — IoT devices are often highly customized and require special software to display the data (e.g. circular watch display and user interface), to reduce the power consumption (e.g., a small battery in a wearable device), to perform specific functions (e.g., push-to-talk) and to connect to the network (e.g., 3G/4G connection). The Company has developed a large number of software libraries that can be reused for various connected devices.
 
Product Realization — Some customers have limited hardware design capabilities. The Company has a strong hardware research and development team to help customers to design the hardware, including the PCBA design and mechanical design. The Company can also provide turn-key services to help customer to handle the manufacturing logistics (including supply chain and EMS management) in order to manufacture the product. The Company has the experiences and resources to manage the factory supply chain, quality control and other manufacturing logistics.
 
Deployment — A number of connected devices require cellular 2G/3G/4G connectivity to connect to the network to access the backend cloud services. If a customer intends to deploy their connected devices in China, the customer can acquire SIM cards with flexible voice/data plans from our MVNO to have the cellular connectivity.
 
Cloud Services and Support — The MVNO can help customers to provision and manage their subscribers database, handle the payment and re-charging and as well as provide data analytics of the subscribers for their usage traffic models.

Competition
 
The Company believes that the marketplace for connected devices and MVNO solutions is highly fragmented, but that few are capable of providing an end-to-end solution with software, hardware, product realization and bundling with a SIM card with voice/data plan (via a MVNO or mobile operator).
 
The market for connected devices and MVNO solutions is rapidly evolving, and in the future the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. The Company expects competition to intensify as new competitors enter the market, and as existing competitors attempt to diversify and expand their software and service solutions offerings across the Android platform. The primary competitors for the Company include traditional hardware-centric OEMs and software development companies.
 

● | The traditional OEMs are strong in hardware design and own factories, but they are very weak in software development as well as not familiar with operator and mobile chipset requirement; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The large software development companies have sizable software teams and global coverage, but they are very weak in hardware design and manufacturing expertise; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Some of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we have. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of the companies that operate in the software and services solutions market may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we have.

Government Regulation 
 
The Company’s operations are subject to extensive and complex state, provincial and local laws, rules and regulations. The PRC government restricts or imposes conditions on foreign investment in telecommunication business. Borqs International Holding Corp and its PRC subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign-invested enterprises under PRC foreign investment related laws. As a result, they are subject to PRC legal restrictions on or conditions for foreign ownership of telecommunication business. Due to these restrictions, the Company conducts its MVNO business in China through BC-NW, its variable interest entity and the subsidiaries of BC-NW. As all the registered shareholders of BC-NW are PRC citizens and all other shareholders of the subsidiaries of BC-NW are also PRC citizens or PRC domestic enterprises, BC-NW and its subsidiaries are therefore considered as PRC domestic enterprises under PRC law. The “registered shareholders” of BC-NW refer to those shareholders who have pledged their equity interest in BC-NW to Borqs Beijing Ltd., or WFOE, and entered into exclusive option agreements with WFOE as part of the contractual arrangements. The Company’s contractual arrangements with BC-NW and the registered shareholders of BC-NW allow it to have the power to direct the activities of BC-NW and its subsidiaries that most significantly impact their economic performance.
 
The Company’s operations are also subject to trial licenses granted by the Ministry of Industry & Information Technology of China, or MIIT, under the mobile virtual network trial program initiated by the MIIT in 2013 to implement the Chinese State Council’s encouragement of private investments in various industries, including telecommunication industry. The trial program and all trial licenses issued thereunder, including those of the Company, were originally set to expire as of December 31, 2015. According to the trial program policies issued by the MIIT, the MIIT will work on formalizing commercial policies regarding the operation of MVNO based on the development of the trial program. On December 28, 2015, the MIIT issued a notice stating that while the government is “diligently researching and determining the formal commercial policies regarding the operation of MVNO, the temporary licenses issued continue to allow MVNO enterprises to operate, and the base telecommunication enterprises shall continue to provide cooperation, support and maintenance services”, as translated from the MIIT’s notice. All MVNOs in China, including the Company, will continue to operate and provide mobile communication services for subscribers based on the trial licenses.
 
The MIIT issued a Notice on the Official Commercial Use of Mobile Communication Resale Business (Draft for Comments), or the Draft Notice, on January 24, 2018, which requires an enterprise that has obtained a trial license, or the Pilot Enterprise to execute commercial contracts with a basic telecommunications company and apply for the telecommunications business license to replace the trial license after certain date to be provided in the official version of the Draft Commercial Use Notice, or the Official Notice. The Pilot Enterprise is allowed to continue to carry out its MNVO business during such application period. According to the Draft Notice, the Pilot Enterprise will be ordered to terminate its MVNO business under certain circumstances, including (1) termination of cooperation between the Pilot Enterprise and the basic telecommunications enterprise resulting in Pilot Enterprise’s failure to operate its business; (2) failure to obtain the telecommunications business license within 2 years since the date of promulgation of the Official Notice; (3) occurrence of serious telecommunication fraud cases or malignant group accidents due to the Pilot Enterprise’s malpractice. The MIIT is currently soliciting comments on this Draft Notice and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. It is also uncertain whether the Official Notice would have any substantial changes from the Draft Notice.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 612 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Most of the Company’s employees are located in China, and a large percentage of its research and development personnel are located in India.
 
The Company pays most of employees a base salary and performance-based bonuses, including annual incentive bonuses and project-based bonuses. It pays commissions to sales personnel. Employees are also eligible to participate in the Company’s stock incentive program.

Geographic Concentration
 
The following table sets forth the Company’s connected solutions net revenues from customers, in absolute amount and as a percentage of net revenues, based on location of the customer’s headquarters. Our MVNO net revenues, which were $20.0 million, $35.1 million and $32.1 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, were related to customers in China. These figures do not take into account the geographic location of end-users of customer products:

 | For the year ended December 31, | 
------------------+-------------------------------------+-------
 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017
 | $ | | % | | $ | % | $ | | | %
 | ($ in thousands) | 
China | | 8,485 | | 15.4 | % | 6,076 | | 7.1 | % | | 17,687 | 14.5 | %
India | | 7,949 | | 14.4 | % | 25,126 | | 29.4 | % | | 70,421 | 57.6 | %
United States | | 14,978 | | 27.2 | % | 34,526 | | 40.4 | % | | 23,312 | 9.1 | %
Rest of the World | | 23,703 | | 43.0 | % | 19,720 | | 23.1 | % | | 10,813 | 8.8 | %
Net Revenues | | 55,115 | | 100.0 | % | 85,448 | | 100.0 | % | | 122,233 | 100 | %

 
The Company’s connected solutions net revenues from customers with headquarters in the United States are attributed to its ongoing collaboration with a prominent mobile chipset vendor and other mobile device OEMs. From 2015 to 2017, revenues from customers with headquarters in China declined slightly, and we engaged a significant new customer in India during the second half of 2016 and this customer continued to place orders with us in 2017.
