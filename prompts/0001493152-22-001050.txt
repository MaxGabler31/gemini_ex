On September 27, 2019, Virtual Interactive Technologies Corp merged with Advanced Interactive Gaming Inc, and its subsidiary Advanced Interactive Gaming Ltd. (collectively “Advanced Interactive Gaming” or “AIG”), through a reverse merger transaction. Advanced Interactive Gaming was founded in 2016 to provide financing solutions for independent video game developers globally.

VRVR finances the development of video game projects to be released on various popular gaming platforms in exchange for a royalty stream on the games. To date the Company has financed several gaming titles including Carmageddon Max Damage, Carmageddon Crashers, Interplanetary: Enhanced Edition, Catch & Release and Worbital. Collectively these games are distributed world-wide on various gaming platforms including Sony PlayStation, Xbox, Steam and Oculus among others. In addition to financing solutions, VRVR offers expertise in development solutions, publishing and marketing video game products and is actively involved in the early stages of VR/AR game development. VRVR continues to reinvest its royalty income into growing its royalty contracts and intellectual property in the video game development industry.
 
The Company’s strategy moving forward is to continue to invest in new game development through partnerships and royalty contracts. Management believes that there is significant opportunity in VR games given the relatively early stage in the product cycle and the growing need for content to support VR hardware sales. While the Company has historically participated mostly in the PC and console market, it will continue to explore addition opportunities in the gaming space as they present themselves. In addition, the VRVR may explore strategic alliances and acquisitions in order to expand its business.

Generally, the video game hardware platforms are divided into mobile gaming on smartphones, PC/laptop gaming and consoles. It is estimated that in 2018, mobile gaming generated approximately $63.2 billion in revenues whereas the PC/laptop market generated approximately $33.5 billion in revenues and console gaming generated approximately $38 billion in revenues. Virtual reality games (“VR”) is still in its relative infancy and mostly in the PC/laptop and console venues but is expected to grow substantially as hardware continues to improve, becomes more affordable and becomes more prolific among mobile gamers. In addition, VR content is still in its relative infancy, which could provide an opportunity for content providers in the coming years.
 
Mobile gaming has seen the largest growth over the other hardware platforms, largely driven by affordability of the devices and availability of content. The largest growing trend within the mobile gaming market has been the free-to-play model whereby monetization comes from in-game purchases. Mobile gaming has its largest footprint in Southeast Asia where mobile devices have seen substantial proliferation over the last decade, whereas console gaming has its largest footprints in North America and Europe where disposable income is higher than other regions of the world.
 
Competition
 
The video game industry is extremely competitive globally with competitors ranging from small independent developers with limited resources to very large development companies with significant financial, technical and marketing resources, such as Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., Activision Blizzard, Inc., Electronic Arts, Inc. and Ubisoft Entertainment, S.A.
 
In addition, while the industry is experiencing significant growth, it also continues to evolve and create new markets, which could lead to additional competition in the future.
