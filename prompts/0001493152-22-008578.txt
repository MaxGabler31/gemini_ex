ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
We were incorporated on October 17, 2017 in the State of Delaware as a blank check company to be used as a vehicle to pursue a business combination with an unidentified target. Following the Merger (as described below), we changed our name from “AG Acquisition Group II, Inc.” to “Blue Star Foods Corp.” and succeeded to the business of Keeler & Co.
Merger
 
On November 8, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), with Keeler & Co., Blue Star Acquisition Corp., our newly formed, wholly-owned Florida subsidiary (“Acquisition Sub”), and John Keeler, Keeler & Co’s sole stockholder (the “Sole Stockholder”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Keeler & Co, which was the surviving corporation and thus became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”).
 
At the Closing Date, each of the 500 shares of common stock of Keeler & Co issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into 30,000 shares of our common stock. As a result, an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of our common stock were issued to the Sole Stockholder.
 
At the effective time of the Merger, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 9,250,000 shares of common stock from the pre-Merger stockholders of the Company (the “Pre-Merger Holders”) for cancellation by the Company (the “Share Redemption”) and, as a result, the Pre-Merger Holders retained an aggregate of 750,000 shares of common stock after the Merger, representing a value of $1.5 million. The shares were redeemed in consideration for the direct benefit the Pre-Merger Holders will receive in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
 
Offering
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we closed a private placement offering (the “Offering”) in which we sold an aggregate of 725 units of our securities (the “Units”) at a purchase price of $1,000 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $725,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of the Company’s 8% Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series A Stock”) and a three-year warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of common stock for every share of common stock that would be received upon conversion of a share of Series A Stock (the “Warrant Shares”), at an exercise price of $2.40. The Series A Stock is convertible into shares (the “Conversion Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, at a conversion rate of $2.00 per share (the “Conversion Rate”). We issued 353,250 Warrant Shares in the Offering, which Warrant Shares are exercisable independently of any conversion of Series A Stock. The net proceeds of the Offering were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. All of the Series A Stock have been converted to shares of the Company’s common stock.
Company Settlement
 
Effective upon the closing of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 688 Units to eleven “accredited investors” (the “Settlement Parties”) for each such individual or entity entering into a settlement and mutual general release agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the Company in full and complete settlement and satisfaction and release of claims such Settlement Parties may have against the Company (the “Company Settlement”).
 
Upon the closing of the Merger, (i) options to purchase an aggregate of 104 shares of Keeler & Co’s common stock at an exercise price of $10,000 per share, which were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, were converted into a ten-year immediately exercisable options to purchase an aggregate of 3,120,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.333 (which option was subsequently terminated unexercised), and (ii) a ten-year option to purchase 3,120,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00, which vested one-year from the date of grant.
 
Changes to the Board of Directors and Executive Officers
 
On the Closing Date of the Merger, the then-current directors and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer of the Company resigned from all such positions as directors and officers of the Company and were replaced by new officers and directors.

Lock-ups
 
In connection with the Merger, each of our executive officers and directors after giving effect to the Merger (the “Restricted Holders”) and each of the Pre-Merger Holders, holding at the closing date of the Merger an aggregate of 750,000 shares of our common stock, entered into lock-up agreements (the “Lock-Up Agreements”), whereby the Restricted Holders were restricted for a period of 18 months and the Pre-Merger Holders were restricted for 12 months, after the Merger (the “Restricted Period”), from sales or dispositions (including pledges) in excess of 50% of all of the common stock held by (or issuable to) them and at a price below $2.20 per share (such restrictions together the “Lock-Up”). Notwithstanding such restrictions, during the Restricted Period (i) the Restricted Holders may transfer up to 10% of their shares to a charitable organization which agrees to be bound by such Lock-Up restrictions and (ii) the Pre-Merger Holders may transfer up to 10% of their shares to a third party which agrees to be bound by such Lock-Up restrictions. From and after the Restricted Period, neither the Restricted Holders nor the Pre-Merger Holders may sell, dispose or otherwise transfer more than one-third of the common stock held by such Holder in any two-month period.
 
Redemption from Pre-Merger Holders
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 9,250,000 shares of common stock from the Company’s Pre-Merger Holders for cancellation by the Company (the “Share Redemption”) and, as a result, the stockholders retained an aggregate of 750,000 shares of common stock after the Merger (the “Retained Shares”), representing a value of $1.5 million. The shares were redeemed in consideration for the direct benefit the Pre-Merger Holders will receive in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
 
Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, and 5,000,000 shares of the preferred stock, of which 10,000 shares have been designated as Series A Stock. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange. Our common stock was quoted on the OTC pink sheets under the symbol “BSFC” since February 18, 2020. Our common stock was approved for listing on NASDAQ under the symbol “BSFC” and began trading on November 3, 2021.
 
Coastal Pride Acquisition
 
On November 26, 2019, Keeler & Co., Inc. (the “Purchaser”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Coastal Merger Agreement”) with Coastal Pride Company, Inc., a South Carolina corporation, Coastal Pride Seafood, LLC, a Florida limited liability company and newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Keeler & Co. (the “Acquisition Subsidiary” and, upon the effective date of the Coastal Merger, the “Surviving Company), and The Walter F. Lubkin, Jr. Irrevocable Trust dated 1/8/03 (the “Trust”), Walter F. Lubkin III (“Lubkin III”), Tracy Lubkin Greco (“Greco”) and John C. Lubkin (“Lubkin”), constituting all of the shareholders of Coastal Pride Company, Inc. immediately prior to the Coastal Merger (collectively, the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the terms of the Coastal Merger Agreement, Coastal Pride Company, Inc. merged with and into the Acquisition Subsidiary, with the Acquisition Subsidiary being the surviving company (the “Coastal Merger”).
 
Coastal Pride is a seafood company, based in Beaufort, South Carolina, that imports pasteurized and fresh crabmeat sourced primarily from Mexico and Latin America and sells premium branded label crabmeat throughout North America.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Coastal Merger Agreement, the following consideration was paid by Keeler & Co.: (i) an aggregate of $394,622 in cash; (ii) a five-year 4% promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 (the “Lubkin Note), issued by Keeler & Co. to Walter Lubkin Jr. (“Walter Jr.”); (iii) three-year 4% convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $210,000 (collectively, the “Sellers Notes” and together with the Lubkin Note, the “Notes”), issued by Keeler & Co. to Greco, Lubkin III and Lubkin, pro rata to their ownership of Coastal Pride Company, Inc. immediately prior to the Coastal Merger; (iii) 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company, issued to Walter Lubkin, Jr. (the “Walter Jr. Shares”); and (iii) an aggregate of 795,000 shares of common stock of the Company, issued to Greco, Lubkin III and Lubkin, pro rata to their ownership of Coastal Pride Company, Inc. immediately prior to the Coastal Merger (together with the Walter Jr. Shares, the “Consideration Shares”).
 
The Notes are subject to a right of offset against the Sellers’ indemnification obligations as described in the Coastal Merger Agreement and are subordinate and subject to prior payment of all indebtedness of John Keeler under the Loan Agreement with Lighthouse Financial Corp., a North Carolina corporation (“Lighthouse”).
 
Principal and interest under the Lubkin Note are payable quarterly, commencing February 26, 2020, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $25,000 and (i) 25% of the Surviving Company’s quarterly earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
 
One-sixth of the principal and interest under the Sellers Notes are payable quarterly commencing on August 26, 2021. The Sellers Notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at the Seller’s option, at any time after the first anniversary of the date of the Note, at the rate of one share for each $2.00 of principal and/or interest so converted (the “Conversion Shares”).
 
Keeler & Co. has the right to prepay the Notes in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium.
 
On April 15, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 16,460 shares of common stock to the Seller’s in lieu of payment in cash of accrued interest in the aggregate amount of $39,504 under the Sellers’ Notes.

At the effective time of the Coastal Merger, the Sellers entered into leak-out agreements (each, a “Leak-Out Agreement”) pursuant to which the Sellers and Walter Jr. may not directly or indirectly pledge, sell, or transfer any of the Consideration Shares or Conversion Shares, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers any of the economic consequences of ownership of any such shares for one year from the date of the Coastal Merger. Thereafter, each Seller and Walter Jr. may transfer up to 25% of the aggregate of the Consideration Shares and the Conversion Shares held by such person, in each successive six-month period.
 
In connection with the Coastal Merger, Lubkin III and Greco agreed to serve as president and chief financial officer, respectively, of the Surviving Company.
 
ACF Finco I, LP (“ACF”) and Keeler & Co. were parties to a loan and security agreement, originally dated as of August 31, 2016. As a condition to ACF’s waiver of certain events of default under the Loan Agreement, and consent to the formation of the Acquisition Subsidiary and the Coastal Merger, the Acquisition Subsidiary and Keeler & Co. entered into the Joinder and Seventh Amendment to the Loan Agreement which resulted, among other things, in Coastal Pride becoming an additional borrower under the Loan Agreement. On March 31, 2021, Keeler & Co. and Coastal Pride entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Lighthouse Financial Corp., a North Carolina corporation (“Lighthouse”), and the loan with ACF was extinguished.
 
Taste of BC Aquafarms Acquisition
 
On April 27, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with TOBC, and Steve Atkinson and Janet Atkinson (the “Sellers”), the owners of all of the capital stock of TOBC (the “TOBC Shares”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the TOBC Shares from the Sellers for an aggregate purchase price of CAD$4,000,000, subject to adjustment based upon the amount of TOBC’s working capital on the closing date (the “Purchase Price”) as follows: (i) CAD$1,000,000 in cash, pro rata with each Seller’s ownership of TOBC (ii) by the issuance to each Seller of a non-interest bearing promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of CAD$200,000, with a maturity date of November 30, 2021, with the principal amount of each note to be pro rata with each Seller’s ownership of TOBC, and secured by a Company guarantee and a general security agreement creating a security interest over certain assets of the Company, and (iii) 987,741 shares of common stock, (representing CAD$2,800,000 of shares based on USD$2.30 per share) with each Seller receiving a pro rata portion of such shares based upon the total number of TOBC shares held by such Seller.
 
On June 24, 2021, the SPA was amended to increase the purchase price to an aggregate of CAD$5,000,000 and the TOBC acquisition closed. Pursuant to the amendment, on August 3, 2021, an aggregate of 344,957 shares of common stock (representing CAD$1,000,000 of additional shares calculated at USD$2.30 per share) was put in escrow until the 24-month anniversary of the closing. If, within 24 months of the closing, TOBC has cumulative revenue of at least CAD$1,300,000, the Sellers will receive all of the escrowed shares. If, as of the 24-month anniversary of the closing, TOBC has cumulative revenue of less than CAD$1,300,000, the Sellers will receive a prorated number of the escrowed shares based on the actual cumulative revenue of TOBC as of such date.
 
In addition to the foregoing consideration, at the time of the closing, the Company provided CAD$488,334 to TOBC for the extinguishment of certain of TOBC’s existing debt.
 
The shares of common stock received by the Sellers are subject to a leak-out restriction commencing on the date of issuance, as follows: (i) up to 25% may be sold after 12 months; (ii) up to 50% may be sold after 18 months; (iii) up to 75% may be sold after 24 months; and (iv) up to 100% may be sold after 30 months.
 
The Seller’s non-interest bearing promissory notes were paid in full at maturity.
 
In connection with the TOBC acquisition, the Sellers entered into four-year confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with the Company.
 
Gault Seafood Asset Acquisition
 
On February 3, 2022, Coastal Pride entered into an asset purchase agreement with Gault Seafood, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (the “Seller”), and Robert J. Gault II, President of the Seller (“Gault”) pursuant to which Coastal Pride acquired all of the Seller’s right, title and interest in and to assets relating to the Seller’s soft shell crab operations, including intellectual property, equipment, vehicles and other assets used in connection with the Business. Coastal Pride did not assume any liabilities in connection with the acquisition. The purchase price for the assets consisted of a cash payment in the amount of $359,250 and the issuance of 167,093 shares of common stock of the Company with a fair value of $359,250. Such shares are subject to a leak-out agreement pursuant to which the Seller may not sell or otherwise transfer the shares until February 3, 2023.

Coastal Pride also entered into a consulting agreement with Gault under the terms of which Gault will provide consulting services to Coastal Pride at the rate of $100 per hour, however, the first 45 days of services will be provided at no cost. Gault also agreed not to compete with Coastal Pride and its affiliates for a period of five years in any market in which Coastal Pride is operating or is considering operating or solicit employees, consultants, customers or suppliers or in any way interfere with Coastal Pride’s business relationships for a five-year period, Gault is also bound by customary confidentiality provisions. The Consulting Agreement may be terminated by either party upon five days written notice and by Costal Pride immediately for cause.
 
In connection with the asset acquisition, Coastal Pride will lease 9,050 square feet from Gault for $1,000 per month under a one-year lease agreement and will continue to operate the acquired soft shell crab operations at such location in Beaufort, South Carolina unless a new facility is earlier completed.
 
Business Overview
 
We are an international sustainable marine protein company that owns and operates several portfolio companies with an emphasis on environmental, social and governance values. We seek to create a vertically integrated seafood company that offers customers high quality products while maintaining a focus on our core values of delivering food safety, traceability and certified resource sustainability. Our companies include:
 
Keeler & Co., doing business as Blue Star Foods, which imports, packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat sourced primarily from Southeast Asia and other premium seafood products;
 
Coastal Pride, which imports pasteurized and fresh crab meat sourced primarily from Mexico and Latin America and sells premium branded label crab meat throughout North America; and
 
TOBC, a land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (“RAS”) salmon farming operation, which sells its steelhead salmon to distributors in Canada.
 
Strategy
 
Our long-term strategy is to create a vertically integrated seafood company that offers customers high quality products while maintaining a focus on our core values of delivering food safety, traceability and certified resource sustainability.
 
We plan to grow the Company organically by continuing to grow our customer base and introducing new high-value product lines and categories, as well as strategically acquiring companies that focus on additional species and proprietary technologies that we believe we can integrate into a larger, diversified company.
 
Operating Companies
 
Keeler & Co., doing business as Blue Star Foods, is an international seafood company that imports, packages and sells refrigerated pasteurized crab meat and other premium seafood products.
 
We purchase the majority of our crab product (Portunus Pelagicus and Portunus Haanii) from processors which source the crab meat from local fishermen in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and India, to whom we pay a premium in order to outfit their boats with a proprietary GPS-based system. This system allows us to trace where the crab product originates and ensure that only mature crabs are being harvested by the use of collapsible traps and not gill nets.
 
The crab meat is purchased directly from processors with whom we have long-standing relationships, that have agreed to source their product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company’s FDA approved Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) Plan. Additionally, all suppliers are certified by the British Retail Consortium (the “BRC”) and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality of our product.

The crab meat which we import is processed in 13 plants throughout Southeast Asia. Our suppliers are primarily via co-packing relationships, including two affiliated suppliers. We sell primarily to food service distributors. We also sell our products to wholesalers, retail establishments and seafood distributors.
 
We have created a technology platform that tracks the product through its entire chain of custody and collects and transmits various data to the Company in real-time, from the loading site to the packing plant, through the sorting and pasteurization process and the exporting process to the end customer. Our technology allows our customers access to their “Scan on Demand” QR code-enabled traceability application.
 
Our premium proprietary brands, Blue Star, Pacifika and Oceanica are differentiated in terms of quality and price point.
 
We believe that we utilize best-in-class technology, in both resource sustainability management and ecological packaging.
 
Our warehouse facility in Miami, Florida is the only crab meat facility audited by the BRC (graded A++) in the U.S.
 
Coastal Pride is a seafood company, based in Beaufort, South Carolina, that imports pasteurized and fresh crab meat (Portunus Pelagicus, Portunus Haanii and Callinectes) sourced primarily from Mexico and Latin America and sells premium branded label crab meat throughout North America.
 
It has three premium branded label products, First Choice, Good Stuff and Coastal Pride Fresh.
 
TOBC is a land-based salmon recirculating aquaculture farm located in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada with an annual production capacity of approximately 100 tons. It produces steelhead salmon under the brand name Little Cedar Farms for distribution in Canada.
 
TOBC’s initial facility has been operated as a model farm for the development of salmon RAS technology. We currently intend to refine this model farm into a 150-ton standardized module that will be replicated in the development of future farms. The next facility we hope to build, subject to sufficient resources, will have 10 such modules, for a total production capacity of 1,500 tons.
 
The current RAS facility is in an insulated, bio-secure structure where all culture conditions are controlled. The primary RAS system is composed of 13 culture tanks, a drum filter, fluidized sand bed biofilter and low head oxygenator and employs an efficient gravity fed low head arrangement which reduces energy use as compared to other RAS designs. Additionally, there are two independent partial reuse finishing tank systems.
 
Weekly harvests of approximately two tons of salmon are stunned and bled at the farm and then processed as fresh iced head on gutted (“HOG”) fish at a Canadian Food Inspection Agency approved processing facility. Currently, TOBC sells its salmon to two wholesale seafood distributors in Canada.
 
Eggs are purchased from two primary suppliers and are hatched approximately every eight weeks. TOBC’s hatchery is composed of a recirculating system that utilizes an upwelling “heath stack” incubator and five tanks with moving bed biofiltration. The fish are then transferred to the main RAS system approximately 12 weeks post hatch. TOBC’s feed is largely terrestrial based from grains and other non-marine ingredients.
 
The faster life cycle from birth to harvesting of our salmon, as compared to conventional salmon, allows it to be produced more economically in contained, land-based RAS farms. Although RAS farms require greater capital investment than the sea cage approach, we believe that the higher costs are offset by more efficient growth and a shorter transportation distance to market.
 
Branded Products
 
Between the three companies, we currently have the following branded products: Blue Star, Pacifika, Oceanica, Crab & Go Premium Seafood, Lubkin, First Choice, Good Stuff, Coastal Pride Fresh and Little Cedar Falls.
 
Blue Star is packed with only high quality Portunus Pelagicus species crab and is produced under exacting specifications and quality control requirements.

-

 

Pacifika is a quality brand for the price conscious end user. The Portunus Haanii crab meat is packed in China and is ideal for upscale plate presentations.
 
Oceanica is made from the Portunus Haanii crab, which is caught and processed in Vietnam. It is an affordable choice to help reduce food cost without sacrificing the look/taste of dishes.
 
Lubkin Brand is packed with quality Portunus Pelagicus species crab in the Philippines and Indonesia.
 
First Choice is a quality brand packed with Portunus Haanii crab meat from Malaysia.
 
Good Stuff is a premium brand packed with high quality Callinectes species crab from Mexico.
 
Coastal Pride Fresh Brand is packed with Callinectes Sapidus from Venezuela and the United States.
 
Grab + Go Premium Seafood is geared towards millennials as part of the trend toward pre-packaged, grab-and-go items. The product is packaged in flexible foil pouches.
 
Steelhead salmon is produced by TOBC under the Little Cedar Falls brand. The fish are sashimi grade and only sold as a fresh item, usually reaching end users within days of harvest.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Sustainable and Traceable Product Sourcing. We believe that our greatest point of differentiation from other seafood companies is our efforts to ensure that our seafood products are ethically sourced in a method that is consistent with our core values and those of our customers.
 
Proprietary Brands. We have created several brands of crab meat that are well regarded amongst our customers and are differentiated by product quality and price point.
 
Eco-Friendly Packaging. Another major point of differentiation from our competitors is our use of sustainable and ethical packaging. Our green pouches for Eco-Fresh crab meat are patented in the United States, Europe, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia under patent Nos.1526091 B1 and US Patents 8,337,922 and 8,445,046. We believe since their introduction in 2003, these pouches have saved in excess of 800 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions versus metal can packaging material.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We intend to grow our business in several ways, including:
 
Growing our existing businesses. The three current existing businesses each have different pathways to organic growth, including by increasing their reliable access to sustainably sourced marine product and supplying to a larger and more diversified customer base. Our key objective is to optimize the management of the companies across all companies, specifically in the marketing, sourcing and financing departments.
 
Strategic Acquisitions. We will continue to seek opportunities to acquire companies that allow us to expand into new territories, diversify our species product categories, and where operational synergies with our existing companies may exist. We believe that we may have the ability to layer on a sustainability model to certain companies that operate in a more traditional way, with an opportunity to increase margins by selling a more premium product.
 
Scaling the RAS Business. We have an internal goal to reach production of 21,000 metric tons of steelhead salmon by 2028. If we can successfully access the necessary funding through the equity capital markets and through certain debt facilities, we hope to build a series of 1,500 metric ton and 3,000 metric ton facilities throughout strategic locations in British Columbia, Canada, where TOBC is currently based.
 
Industry Overview
 
The international seafood industry is going through a period of rapid change as it strives to meet the needs of a growing population around the world, where food consumption habits are evolving. We believe there are powerful trends emerging in the developing world (including a growing demand for animal-based protein) as well as in the developed world (where there is an increased awareness and focus on sustainable sourcing and protecting marine ecosystems).

Changes in Population Growth and Global Seafood Consumption:
 
The United Nations estimates that there will be close to 9.7 billion people on our planet by the year 2050, a significant increase from the existing population estimates of 7.7 billion(1).
 
As the population has grown, so has per capita fish consumption. Per capita food fish consumption grew from 9.0 kg (live weight equivalent) in 1961 to 20.5 kg in 2018, by about 1.5% per year(2).
 
Aquaculture Has Developed as a Major Source to Meet Global Seafood Demand:
 
The wild fish catch reached a peak at 94 metric tons(3)(in the mid-1990s) and has since stagnated. Nearly all of the increase in world marine protein supply has since come from aquaculture.
 
In 2016, aquaculture provided more than half (80 metric tons)(4) of all marine protein consumed.
 
It is estimated that aquaculture production may need to double between 2010 through 2050, from 60 metric tons in 2010 to roughly 140 metric tons in 2050(5), to meet estimated demand.
 
We believe that Recirculatory Aquatic Systems are likely to be a highly disruptive technology.
 
Rear fish at high densities, in indoor tanks in a “controller” environment. The culture water is purified and reused continuously, in an almost completed closed circuit. Recirculating systems are capable of reusing approximately 90% of culture water. Solid waste, ammonium and CO2 are either removed or converted into non-toxic bio products (fertilizers). The purified water is subsequently saturated with oxygen and returned to the fish tanks.

Suppliers
 
We purchase crab meat directly from 13 processors with which we have long-standing relationships, that have agreed to source their product in a sustainable manner. All crab meat is sourced under the Company’s FDA approved HACCP Plan. Additionally, all suppliers are certified grade A by the BRC and are audited annually to ensure safety and quality.
 
The Company had four suppliers which accounted for approximately 70% of the Company’s total purchases during the year ended December 31, 2021. These four suppliers are located in the United States, Indonesia, Mexico and China, which accounted for approximately 80% of the Company’s total purchases during the year. During 2021, the Company purchased inventory from one non-affiliated Mexican supplier that made up the balance of 42% of the supply concentration.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
The Company’s products are sold in the United States and Canada. Its primary current source of revenue is importing blue and red swimming crab meat primarily from Indonesia, Mexico, China, the Philippines and Vietnam and distributing it in the United States and Canada under several brand names such as Blue Star, Oceanica, Pacifika, Crab & Go, Lubkin’s Coastal Pride, First Choice, Good Stuff, Coastal Pride Fresh and TOBC steelhead salmon produced under the brand name Little Cedar Falls primarily to two distributor/brokers.
 
The Company has a sales team based throughout the United States who sell directly to customers, most of whom are in the food service and retail industry and also manage a network of regional and national brokers, that cover both the retail and wholesale segments. The sales team and brokers help to pull the products through the system by creating demand at the end user level and pulling the demand through our distributor customers. The Company sells to retail customers either directly or via distributors that specialize in the retail segment.
 
The Company does not own its own fleet of trucks and utilizes less than truckload freight shipping (“LTL”) national freight carriers to deliver its products to its customers. LTL is used for the transportation of small freight or when freight does not require the use of an entire trailer. When shipping LTL, the Company pays for a portion of a standard truck trailer, and other shippers and their shipments fill the unoccupied space.

Customers
 
Our customer base is comprised of some of the largest companies in the food service and retail industry throughout the United States. We sell our crab meat to our customers through purchase orders. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales to food distributors and retail and wholesale clubs accounted for 52% of our revenue. The balance of our revenue is derived from smaller seafood distributors and value-added processors.
 
The Company had ten customers which accounted for approximately 52% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. One customer accounted for 24% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Outstanding receivables from these customers accounted for approximately 59% of the total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. The loss of any major customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
 
Competition
 
In general, the international seafood industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with local and overseas manufacturers and importers engaged in similar products.
 
The Company’s primary competitors in its traditional sustainable seafood businesses are Tri Union Frozen Products, Inc. (Chicken of the Sea Frozen Foods), Phillips Foods, Inc., Harbor Seafood, Inc., Newport International and Twin Tails Seafood Corp.
 
The Company’s primary competitors in its RAS business are Aquabounty, Atlantic Sapphire, Aquaco, Nordic Aquafarms, Whole Oceans, West Coast Salmon and Pure Salmon.

Government Regulation
 
Our third-party distribution facilities and our international suppliers are certified in accordance with the HACCP, standards for exporting aquatic products to the United States. The HACCP standards are developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), pursuant to the FDA’s HACCP regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, part 123, and are used by the FDA to help ensure food safety and control sanitary standards.
Food Safety and Labeling
 
We are subject to extensive regulation, including, among other things, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. The FSMA was enacted in order to aid the effective prevention of food safety issues in the food supply. This comprehensive and evolving regulatory program impacts how food is grown, packed, processed, shipped and imported into the United States and it governs compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“GMPs”). The FDA has finalized seven major rules to implement FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to make clear specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, and criminal sanctions, any of which could impact our results of operations.

In addition, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on the labels of food products.
 
Our operations and products are also subject to state and local regulation, including the registration and licensing of plants, enforcement by state health agencies of various state standards, and the registration and inspection of facilities. Compliance with federal, state and local regulation is costly and time-consuming. Enforcement actions for violations of federal, state, and local regulations may include seizure and condemnation of products, cease and desist orders, injunctions or monetary penalties. We believe that our practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations.
 
Trade
 
For the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside of the United States, and for the shipment of products to customers located outside of the United States, we are subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Our activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
TOBC
 
TOBC’s aquafarms facility in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada with an annual production capacity of approximately 100 tons are licensed under the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Harvests of steelhead salmon are processed as iced HOG fish at locally at a Canadian Food Inspection Agency approved processing facility.
Federal Trade Commission
 
We are subject to certain regulations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Advertising of our products is subject to such regulation pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Employee Safety Regulations
 
We are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health, and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents.
Anticorruption
 
Because we are organized under the laws of a state and our principal place of business is in the United States, we are considered a “domestic concern” under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and are covered by the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The provisions prohibit any domestic concern and any officer, director, employee, or agent, acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to (i) influence any act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining or retaining business, or directing business to another person.
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of federal, state, and local laws and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These requirements relate to a broad range of our activities, including the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, and reporting of, and emergency response in connection with, hazardous materials (including asbestos) associated with our operations; noise emissions from our facilities; and safety and health standards, practices, and procedures that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities.

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we had twenty-one full time employees and no part-time employees. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
