our customers purchase one or more cranes together with several attachments to permit use of the crane in a broader range of lifting applications and other operations.
 For the most part, the Company sells its entire product offering and full line of services in most regions of the world. Moreover, the Company reports under a geographic reporting structure to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The Company’s main products it sells in each region are as follows.   
 Lattice-boom cranes.    Under the Manitowoc brand name, we design, manufacture, market and sell lattice-boom crawler cranes. Lattice-boom cranes consist of a lattice-boom, which is a fabricated, high-strength steel structure that has four chords and tubular lacings, mounted on a crawler base. Lattice-boom cranes weigh less and provide higher lifting capacities than a mobile telescopic crane of similar boom length. The lattice-boom cranes are the only category of crane that can pick and move simultaneously with a full-rated load. The lattice-boom sections, together with the crane base, are transported to and erected at a project site.
 Our lattice-boom cranes are used to lift material and equipment in a wide variety of applications and end markets, including heavy construction, bridge and highway, infrastructure and energy-related projects. These cranes are also used by the value-added crane rental industry, which serves all of the aforementioned end markets. Lattice boom cranes are produced in the U.S. and lower lifting capacity lattice boom crawler cranes are purchased as complete units from a strategic manufacturer.
 We also offer our lattice-boom crawler crane customers various attachments that provide our cranes with greater capacity in terms of height, movement and lifting. Our principal attachments are: MAX-ERTM attachments, luffing jibs and RINGERTM attachments. The MAX-ERTM is a trailing counterweight, heavy-lift attachment that dramatically improves the reach, capacity and lift dynamics of the basic crane to which it is mounted. It can be transferred between cranes of the same model for maximum economy and occupies less space than competitive heavy-lift systems. A luffing jib is a fabricated structure similar to, but smaller than, a lattice-boom. Mounted at the tip of a lattice-boom, a luffing jib easily adjusts its angle of operation permitting one crane with a luffing jib to make lifts at additional locations on the project site. It can be transferred between cranes of the same model to maximize utilization. A RINGERTM attachment is a high-capacity lift attachment that distributes load reactions over a large area to minimize ground-bearing pressure. It can also be more economical than transporting and setting up a larger crane. 
 Tower cranes.    Under the Potain brand name, we design, manufacture, market and sell tower cranes primarily utilized in the building and construction industries. Tower cranes offer the ability to lift and distribute material at the point of use, more quickly and accurately than other types of lifting machinery, without utilizing substantial square footage on the ground. Tower cranes include a stationary vertical mast and a horizontal jib with a counterweight, which is placed near the vertical mast. A cable runs through a trolley which is mounted on the jib, enabling the load to move along the jib. The jib rotates 360 degrees, thus increasing the crane’s work area. Unless using a remote control device, operators occupy a cabin, located where the jib and mast meet, which provides superior visibility above the worksite. We offer a complete line of tower crane products, including top slewing, luffing jib, topless, self-erecting and special cranes for dams, harbors and other large building projects. Top-slewing cranes are the most traditional form of tower cranes. Self-erecting cranes are bottom-slewing cranes which have a counterweight located at the bottom of the mast and are able to be erected, used and dismantled on job sites without assist cranes.
 Top-slewing tower cranes have a tower and multi-sectioned horizontal jib. These cranes rotate from the top of their mast and can increase in height with the project. Top-slewing cranes are transported in separate pieces and assembled at the construction site in one to three days depending on the height. These cranes are generally sold to medium to large building and construction groups, as well as to rental companies.  These cranes are produced in France, Portugal, India and China.
 Topless tower cranes are a type of top-slewing crane and, unlike all others, have no cathead or jib tie-bars on the top of the mast. The cranes are utilized primarily when overhead height is constrained or in situations where several cranes are installed close together. Topless tower cranes are produced in France, Portugal, India and China.
 Luffing jib tower cranes, which are a type of top-slewing crane, have an angled rather than horizontal jib. Unlike other tower cranes which have a trolley that controls the lateral movement of the load, luffing jib cranes move their load by changing the angle of the jib. The angle is modified using either a cable controlled by a luffing winch or hydraulic cylinder. The cranes are utilized primarily in urban areas where space is constrained or in situations where several cranes are installed close together. Luffing jib tower cranes are produced in France and China.

Self-erecting tower cranes are mounted on axles or transported on a trailer. The lower segment of the range unfolds in four sections, two for the mast and two for the jib. The smallest of our models unfolds in less than eight minutes; larger models erect in a few hours. Self-erecting cranes rotate from the bottom of their mast and are utilized primarily in low to medium rise construction and residential applications. Self-erecting tower cranes are produced in France and Italy.
 Mobile telescopic cranes.    Under the Grove brand name, we design, manufacture, market and sell mobile telescopic cranes utilized in industrial, commercial and construction applications, as well as in maintenance applications to lift and move material at job sites. Mobile telescopic cranes consist of a telescopic boom mounted on a wheeled carrier. Mobile telescopic cranes have the ability to drive between sites, and some are permitted on public roadways. We currently offer the following five types of mobile telescopic cranes: rough-terrain, all-terrain, truck-mounted, telescopic crawler and industrial.
 Rough-terrain cranes are designed to lift materials and equipment on rough or uneven terrain, and their versatility allows them to carry out many different lifts within the boundaries of given sites. These cranes cannot be driven on public roadways, and, accordingly, must be transported by truck to a work site. Rough-terrain cranes are produced in the U.S. and Italy.
 All-terrain cranes are versatile cranes designed to lift materials and equipment on rough or uneven terrain and yet are highly maneuverable and capable of highway speeds. All-terrain cranes are often used for specific, one-off, heavy, high lifts requiring careful lift-planning and engineering. All-terrain cranes are produced in Germany.
 Truck-mounted cranes are designed to provide simple set-up and long reach and have high capacity booms. They are capable of traveling from site to site at highway speeds. These cranes are produced in the U.S. and are suitable for urban and suburban uses.
 Telescopic crawler cranes are designed to lift materials on rugged terrain.  These cranes consist of a telescopic boom superstructure mounted to a crawler crane chassis. These cranes combine excellent gradeability and lift capacity with 100 percent pick and carry capabilities. These cranes are purchased as complete units from a strategic manufacturer.
 Industrial cranes are designed primarily for plant maintenance, storage yard and material handling jobs. These cranes allow for picking up and carrying loads on a smooth, flat surface. We manufacture industrial cranes in the U.S. under the Grove and Shuttlelift brand names.
 We offer our hydraulic boom truck products under the National Crane brand name. A boom truck is a hydraulically powered telescopic crane mounted on a conventional truck chassis. Telescopic boom trucks are used primarily for lifting material on a job site and are mostly deployed by end users in the North American market. We currently offer telescoping boom trucks under the National Crane brand name. These cranes are produced in the U.S.
 Backlog and customers.   The year-end backlog of products includes accepted orders that have been placed on a production schedule that we expect to be shipped and billed primarily within one year. Manitowoc’s backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $606.6 million, $323.8 million and $512.6 million, respectively. Our backlog at the end of 2017 increased from the end of 2016 due in part to higher customer demand for mobile hydraulic products across all regions, as well as increased demand for our top slewing cranes in Europe.
 The Company does not have any customers that individually comprise more than 10% of its consolidated net sales.
 Manufacturing
 Manitowoc operates ten manufacturing facilities (including remanufacturing facilities) that utilize a variety of processes. In general, the Company’s manufacturing process involves the fabrication and machining of raw materials, primarily steel, which are then manufactured into sub-assemblies. Sub-assemblies are then assembled with purchased components into a complete machine. In its manufacturing operations, Manitowoc maintains advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment and utilizes extensive process automation. The Company has also invested in Product Verification Centers at its major manufacturing facilities to support new product development, testing and qualification of sub-systems and final product designs.
