Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
We provide a content discovery and creation platform with a global audience of more than 34 million monthly active users. Users primarily access our content via our smartphone app, called Zedge, which offers an easy and modular way to customize smart phones. Our Zedge app offers an easy, entertaining and immersive way for users to engage with our rich and diverse library of more than one million images and audio clips. Such content is optimal for mobile phone customization, co-creation which allows users to personalize the content with digital stickers for social posting and sharing, and even printing on personalized physical goods like phone cases and apparel, and other uses. Today we offer wallpapers, stickers, ringtones, notification sounds and video wallpapers. In the future, we plan on offering new content verticals and supporting enhanced features furthering our goal of being the hub for all “everything you” content and functionality.
 
Our Zedge app’s success stems from its ability to meet consumer demand for a rich and diverse catalogue of both long-tail and popular content, to offer reliable search and discovery capabilities and to make relevant content recommendations to our users. Our Zedge app utilizes both user-generated and licensed, third-party content to achieve these goals.
 
In early 2018, our Zedge app launched Zedge Premium, a marketplace where professional creators and brands can market, distribute and sell their digital content to our consumers. Over time, we expect that Zedge Premium will contribute to a virtuous cycle whereby it drives new consumers into our Zedge app resulting in more artist payouts, which in turn makes the platform more attractive for artists and brands looking to expand their reach and increase their income. In September of 2017, we closed the Freeform Development, Inc., or Freeform, acquihire in order to accelerate the launch and development of Zedge Premium.
 
Our Zedge app, available in the Google Play and iTunes app stores, has been installed over 336 million times, and as of July 31, 2018, had more than 34 million monthly active users, or MAU. MAU is a key performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that used our Zedge app in the previous 30-day period. Historically, our Zedge app has been able to grow its user base without material investment in marketing, user acquisition or advertising. Our Zedge app has often been among the top 40 free applications in the Google Play store in the United States and in the iTunes Entertainment category for the past five years.
 
We believe that our Zedge app’s popularity stems from its ability to provide users with a rich array of personally relevant digital content in a fun, intuitive and user-friendly fashion that aligns with their interest in expressing their essence in a bespoke manner. To this end, we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy both our Zedge app’s user’s and content contributor’s expectations.
 
As of July 31, 2018, approximately 32% and 28% of our Zedge app’s user base was located in North America and Europe, respectively. Over the past two years we have experienced a shift in our regional customer make-up with MAU increasing in the emerging markets and decreasing in the well-developed markets. In fiscal 2018, users in the emerging markets grew by 22.5% while users in the well-developed regions declined 8.3% when compared to fiscal 2017. This shift has negatively impacted revenue generation because the well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to those in the emerging markets. We believe that we can change our growth dynamic in the well-developed markets based on a set of growth initiatives including improving search results, content recommendations, gamification and the role that Zedge Premium artists can have on driving new users into the platform
 
Historically we have generated approximately 90% of our revenues from selling our Zedge app’s advertising inventory to advertising networks, advertising exchanges, and direct arrangements with advertisers. Advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third-party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks. The price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through bidding on an advertising exchange. Advertisers are attracted to our Zedge app because of its sizable user base. The remainder of our revenues are primarily generated from managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher, as well as overseeing the billing, collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher. As Zedge Premium matures and expands, we expect it to also diversify our revenue mix. In order to acquire, or unlock, the content in Zedge Premium, a user is required to either watch a video advertisement or purchase the item with virtual coins. When this happens, as of July 31, 2018, we report 30% of the net revenues with the remaining 70% going to the artist.

During fiscal 2018, we generated revenues of $10.8 million and a loss from operations of $1.3 million, compared to revenues of $10.0 million and a loss from operations of $0.7 million in fiscal 2017.
 
During fiscal 2018, advertisements from MoPub (owned by Twitter) represented 35% of our revenue, advertisements from Google represented 22% of our revenues and advertisements from Facebook represented 7% of our revenues, as compared with 43%, 17% and 10%, respectively, during fiscal 2017. In addition, advertisements from Ogury contributed 14% of our revenues during fiscal 2018.
 
Recent Developments
 
In March 2018, we completed the launch of Zedge Premium, a section of our Zedge app where consumers are able to access a wide portfolio of professionally created content, including high-definition wallpapers, exclusive ringtones, music, videos and 3D-augmented reality figures created by digital artists, photographers, illustrators, musicians and audio engineers from around the world.
 
In September 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Release with Freeform and certain of its former employees, pursuant to which we obtained releases for the employees from their Freeform employment agreements in exchange for the repayment of Freeform’s liabilities.

We believe that the following competitive strengths drive the growth of our business:
 

● | Leading global provider of mobile personalization content. We offer our Zedge app globally, enabling users to easily personalize their mobile phones with a wide variety of free, high-quality ringtones, wallpapers, notification sounds, video wallpapers and stickers.

Our Zedge app’s global footprint helps us to secure a highly diverse portfolio of content addressing various customer tastes and preferences. In addition, our Zedge app’s customer base attracts advertisers seeking customers that have adequate disposable income to purchase their products and services. Our large customer base is also a draw to artists and brands looking to market their content to a critical mass of users.

Professional artists, individual creators and brands turn to our Zedge platform for marketing and distributing their content to our consumers. Such content is optimal for uses including, but not limited to, mobile phone personalization, social sharing and posting, even printing on personalized physical goods like phone cases and apparel. We aspire to have our Zedge app be the “everything you” destination that smartphone users go to when looking for digital content which they can further personalize and share with their friends. Our Zedge app currently offers wallpapers, stickers, ringtones, notification sounds and video wallpapers. In the future, we plan to offer new content verticals and enhanced features in our Zedge app.
 
We strive to have our Zedge app become the world’s leading platform for personalization content that consumers use to express their essence, individuality, and voice in an easy, entertaining and immersive fashion. To achieve this, we are concentrating our efforts on the following goals:
 

● | Continue growing our Zedge app’s user base, globally. We expect to continue devoting material resources in growing our Zedge app’s user base by: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | studying user needs and enhancing our app to meet those needs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing and offering new and exciting products, features and services that make us relevant to new users interested in personalized digital; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our addressable served market and expanding into new markets by localizing, collaborating and optimizing with relevant strategic partners. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ongoing product and technology investment in our Zedge app. We plan on making continued investments in product feature sets and functionalities in our Zedge app needed to drive new users into the platform and position our Zedge app’s content contributors for optimal success in achieving their marketing and sales goals. Some of these initiatives include ongoing investment in our Zedge app’s search and discovery, content recommendations, supporting new content verticals, improving our Zedge app’s self-serve platform, and connecting creators with relevant end users via our Zedge app. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Building our Zedge App into a Best-of-Breed Platform for Artists and Creators. Our goal is to build our Zedge app into a platform that artists view as prioritizing their needs ahead of other platforms and addressing all aspects of their marketing and revenue generation goals including but not limited to, ease in managing their virtual storefront, promotion, education, reporting, and distribution. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase our marketing efforts for our Zedge app. Historically, we haven’t invested materially in marketing initiatives for our Zedge app. Going forward, we envision the need to better promote our Zedge app and to amplify our Zedge app’s value proposition to artists and individual creators. We envisage these creators and influencers and brands self-promoting their availability on our Zedge app in order to extend their reach, generating incremental income and drive more end-user traffic to our platform. Furthermore, we also invest in app store optimization, search, marketing automation, social marketing and community management in order to retain and expand our Zedge app’s customer base. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve our Zedge app’s monetization. We will continue exploring additional monetization methods for our Zedge app, including in-app purchases, subscription models, e-commerce, new advertising products and brand sponsorships. We believe that our Zedge app’s large and expanding customer base is an attractive medium for advertisers, brands and artists and that this will result in new monetization opportunities for our Zedge app over time. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selectively pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. On a selective basis, we will look to invest in or purchase entities that can provide synergistic growth opportunities for our Zedge app and otherwise. In September of 2017, we closed the Freeform acquihire in order to accelerate the launch and development of Zedge Premium. We plan to leverage our understanding of the smartphone industry to pursue additional opportunities that we believe can impact our business in a materially positive fashion.

Our History
 
In 2003, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes and Paul Shaw launched a consumer website at www.zedge.net that people used to upload and download ringtones. Traffic to the website grew, primarily by word of mouth, drawing customers from the emerging markets. In December 2006, IDT Corporation acquired 90% of Zedge. Zedge Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2008, and our name was changed to Zedge, Inc. in 2016.
 
In 2009, we introduced our Android Zedge app. The Zedge app provided ease-of-use by negating the need for the customer to first download a ringtone or wallpaper to their computer and then upload that content to their mobile phone.
 
In 2011, Tom Arnoy was promoted to our Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Reich was retained as our Chief Operating Officer.
 
We launched our iOS Zedge app in 2013, followed by launch of our Windows Mobile Zedge app in 2014.
 
During 2014 and 2015, our Zedge app introduced app icons, social sharing features and marketing automation capabilities, and expanded the number of languages supported.
 
In 2016, IDT Corporation spun off our stock to its stockholders, and our Class B Common Stock is now listed on the NYSE American with the ticker symbol “ZDGE”.
 
In March 2018, we completed the launch of Zedge Premium, a section of our Zedge app where consumers are able to access a wide portfolio of professionally created content, including high-definition wallpapers, exclusive ringtones, music, videos and 3D-augmented reality figures created by digital artists, photographers, illustrators, musicians and audio engineers from around the world.
 
Our Technology
 
We have developed our Zedge app as a scalable distributed platform that is comprised of both open source and proprietary technologies centered on content management and discovery, web and app development, data mining and analytics, deep learning, mobile content/device compatibility, advertising and reporting. We have built a solid framework that allows us to ideate, test, and launch where warranted by the outcome and we have embraced machine learning throughout our technology stack in order to improve content recommendations and relevancy. From an end user’s perspective, our Zedge app’s platform minimizes response latency while maximizing content relevancy and discoverability. We optimize our Zedge app by utilizing systems, algorithms and heuristics that organize our Zedge app’s content based upon real user data and that render the content in a relevant fashion. Our Zedge app’s architecture provides a fully redundant production environment in a cloud-hosted virtual server environment.
Competition
 
Our Zedge app faces competition across many different fronts including:
 

● | Mobile personalization products. Generally, our Zedge app competes with other developer’s mobile apps from the vantage point of an end-user’s screen time. More specifically, ringtones, wallpapers, notification sounds, video wallpapers and stickers are a commodity, and many smaller apps and websites offer this content both free and for a fee. We believe that our Zedge app has a competitive advantage due to its: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | large user base; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | “one stop shop” approach which avails customers of this content within the same app; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | modular approach that allows the customer to selectively choose what they would like to personalize without handing over the core elements of the native operating system to a third party and overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | large content catalogue; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary recommendation engine; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | market ranking and its longevity. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advertisers. We face significant competition for advertising spend on our Zedge app from both digital media providers and traditional media outlets, including television, radio and print, many of which have significantly more resources than us. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Content creators. There are many websites and mobile apps that focus on offering content creators an eco-system in which they can market and sell their digital art. Yet, we are not aware of many that have access to an embedded customer base with more than 34 million MAU, which we believe makes our Zedge app more attractive to content creators. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
