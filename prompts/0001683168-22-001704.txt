ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Corporate History; Change in Control
 
Yuengling’s Ice Cream Corporation (f/k/a Aureus Incorporated) (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 19, 2013. The Company was organized to develop and explore mineral properties in the State of Nevada. On October 1, 2014, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Gold Exploration Management Services, Inc. (“Gold Exploration”) pursuant to which the Company purchased 100% of Gold’s Exploration’s interest in one claim block of 11 claims or 220 acres, in Elko County, Nevada (the “Gold Creek Property”) for $15,000. The claims were registered in the name of Gold Exploration. On August 31, 2015, Gold Exploration’s title to the mining claims on the Gold Creek Property expired but has been re-staked by the Company. In September 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) imposed a prohibition on mining activities on 10 million acres of public and National Forest System Lands, including the Gold Creek Property, in order to protect the greater sage-grouse and its habitat from adverse effects of locatable mineral exploration and mining activities, subject to valid existing rights (the “Land Freeze”). Due to the Land Freeze, the Company has not been able to have the title to the Gold Creek Property transferred into the Company’s name or to conduct any activities on the Gold Creek Property.
 
On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into that certain Purchase Agreement (the “MMLH Purchase Agreement”) with Montana Mine Land Holdings LLC, a Montana limited liability company wholly-owned by Tracy Fortner (“MMLH”) pursuant to which the Company acquired a 100% undivided interest on MMLH’s patented mining’s claims and the property located in Broadwater County, Montana (the “Mining Interests”) in consideration for $112,000 payable in 45,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.00248889 per share for a total of $112,000 (the “Property Shares”). The Company had not issued the Property Shares due to the fact there was not a sufficient amount of authorized common stock available at the time. This agreement was cancelled on November 7, 2017. There were no actions taken pursuant to the terms of the agreement and the stock was never issued. The transaction as originally accounted for had no impact to the statement of operations and zero net impact to the balance sheet; as such the transaction has been reversed and is not reflected in these financial statements.

Business Overview
 
Yuengling’s is an American and family-owned company with high brand recognition & loyalty. Its products are considered in the super-premium category and are all-natural. Yuengling’s exceeds Whole Foods Market® Ingredient Quality Standards. Its products are kosher with no added growth hormones, steroids, or antibiotics.
 
Yuengling’s is a strong, recognized brand with a long, positive family history and an experienced management team. We are smaller and more responsive than larger competitors.
 
When national brands continue to reduce the quality of their offerings and downsize their products, Yuengling’s products compare favorably and provide good “value” to our customers. We offer innovative new products and flavors.

Operating Strategy
 
Yuengling’s retail operating strategy is three-phased, centering on (1) product development, (2) achieving acceptance in a defined core area, and (3) expanding our operations once specific volume and metrics are attained. We are currently in the early stages of phase two.
Marketing and Distribution
 
Yuengling’s core marketing area is defined as the area from Scranton, Pennsylvania in the North, central Virginia in the South, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the West, and the New Jersey shore to the East. We believe we offer higher than average overall margins for retailers.
 
Our goal is to establish critical mass distribution and specific consumer acceptance levels in the defined core marketing area. We feel this will be accomplished through brand promotion at the store level and top-of-mind-focused marketing programs, including large-scale and small-scale direct consumer product sampling. Once we have sufficient market penetration in our core marketing area, we plan to expand and establish the brand outside this area. At the time of this filing, Yuengling’s Ice Cream is sold in select markets in eastern Pennsylvania.
 
The Company plans to begin selling its three-gallon tubs to food service customers in the spring or early summer of 2022. The Company also plans to begin selling its ice cream pints to distributors and retailers in the spring or summer of 2022.
 
In the future, we anticipate working with several independent ice cream distributors, rather than a few large distributors, to distribute our products regionally and nationally. To help facilitate customer relationships, we may engage food brokers to act as our agents within designated territories or for specific accounts and receive commissions, which average 5% of net collected sales.
 
Our ice cream is shipped from our manufacturer to third-party cold storage facilities. In turn, our products are distributed from these cold storage facilities. We do not own, lease or otherwise maintain any vehicles involved in the shipping of our products.
 
Development Strategy
 
Our development strategy began with market entry in February 2014. The target was to establish distribution in retail grocery stores within the core marketing area with six-quart flavors of ice cream per store. Distribution is warehouse-based.
 
We believe our products are a slight bargain compared to super-premium brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Daz and on par with other brands such as Gifford’s. Our promotional pricing strategy depends upon the retailer, with brand positioning as a super-premium offering. We sometimes engage in short-term Everyday Low Price (“EDLP”) program pricing to undermine the existing premium and super-premium players.

Production
 
Yuengling’s Ice Cream is currently produced by Totally Cool, Inc. (“Totally Cool”) at a high quality, modern, FDA-compliant facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. Our packaging consists of six quarts to a case, eight pints to a case, and three-gallon tubs. Totally Cool is a smaller ice cream production facility that produces ice cream and other frozen desserts for several local, regional, and national brands. Totally Cool’s size allows for smaller and more flexible production runs. We currently do not have a written agreement with Totally Cool; but rather, we order our products as needed pursuant to purchase orders. We do not anticipate that we would encounter any material difficulty in obtaining alternative production sources, at a comparable cost, if our co-packer decides to terminate their relationships with us. Nevertheless, any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company.
Product Specifications
 
Our packaging consists of six quarts to a case and eight pints to a case. We offer super-premium butterfat (14%) basis with super-premium flavorings and super-premium ingredients. Our products have high solids, and mid-range weight (50% overrun/air) for a super-premium mouth feel.
Product History
 
In February 2014, Yuengling’s brand was launched in quart containers in 10 flavors. Quarts were the best way to gain access to shelf space without displacing an existing 48oz or 16oz products. In October 2014, we launched two seasonal flavors, and we added four new flavors in February 2015. In July 2015, we launched six-pint flavors in 800 Ahold stores and began 3-gallon tub food service sales. In May 2016, we were granted a trademark for “Black & Tan” for the ice cream category, and in September 2016, we were granted a trademark for “Butterbeer” for the ice cream category.
 
At the national level, our primary retail competitors are Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs. At the regional level, our direct retail competitors are Giffords (Maine), Graeter’s (Ohio), and Turkey Hill (Pennsylvania).
 
Primary Advantages
 
We believe we have a higher quality than most national brands, comparable to Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs. We have new and different flavors. We also believe we have better value to consumers in cost per ounce, strong brand loyalty, and close relationships with retailers.
