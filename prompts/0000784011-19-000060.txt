Item 1.   BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
When we refer to the “Partnership,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. In some contexts, particularly with respect to our co-investment in our private equity timber funds, “Partnership” may refer to Pope Resources and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, exclusive of the timber funds. References to notes to the financial statements refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership, included in Item 8 of this report. Statements of intention, belief, or expectation reflect intent, beliefs and expectations of our management and the Board of Directors of our managing general partner as of the date of this report, based on information known to them as of that date. Readers should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are, in large part, an attempt to predict future outcomes and events, and the section of this report entitled “Item 1A: Risk Factors” contains a non-exhaustive list of factors that may cause us to fall short of our expectations or to deviate from the plans discussed herein.
The Partnership was formed in 1985 as a result of the spinoff of certain timberlands and development properties from Pope & Talbot, Inc.
We currently operate in four primary business segments: (1) Partnership Timber, (2) Funds Timber, (3) Timberland Investment Management, and (4) Real Estate. Operations in our two timber segments consist of growing, managing, harvesting, and marketing timber from the Partnership’s 120,000 acres of direct timberland ownership in Washington (Partnership Timber) and our private equity timber funds’ 134,000 acres (as of December 31, 2018) of timberland in Washington, Oregon, and California that we co-own with our third-party investors (Funds Timber). Our Timberland Investment Management segment is engaged in organizing and managing private equity timber funds using capital invested by third parties and the Partnership. Our Real Estate segment’s operations are focused on a portfolio of approximately 2,000 acres in the west Puget Sound region of Washington, most of which are legacy timberlands that have become suitable as development property owing to the expansion of the Puget Sound metropolitan and suburban areas. Recently, we have acquired and developed a couple other properties for sale, either on our own or by partnering with other experienced real estate developers. This segment’s activities consist of efforts to enhance the value of our land by obtaining the entitlements and, in some cases, building the infrastructure necessary to enable further development, and then selling those properties, ordinarily to commercial and residential developers. Our Real Estate operations also include ownership and management of commercial properties, including Port Gamble, Washington, now an historic town. Port Gamble was established by Pope & Talbot in 1853 and was operated as a company town for over 165 years and served as the location for a lumber mill for most of that time.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Partnership Timber and Funds Timber
Background. The 120,000 timberland acres that we own under the Partnership Timber segment consist of the approximately 67,000-acre Hood Canal tree farm, located in western Washington, and the 53,000-acre Columbia tree farm located in southwest Washington. The Hood Canal and Columbia tree farms are the Partnership’s core holdings, and we manage them as a single operating unit for planning harvest volumes. When we refer to these two tree farms, we will describe them as the “Partnership’s tree farms.” We have owned the Hood Canal tree farm, substantially as currently comprised, since our formation in 1985. We acquired the bulk of the Columbia tree farm in 2001, a smaller block in 2004, added over 8,000 acres to this tree farm in 2016, and over 1,000 acres in each of 2017 and 2018.
The Funds Timber segment includes the operations and management of ORM Timber Fund II (Fund II), ORM Timber Fund III (Fund III), and ORM Timber Fund IV (Fund IV), which are consolidated into Pope Resources’ financial 
3

statements. Fund IV was launched in December 2016 and acquired its first two timberland properties in January 2018, and another in October 2018, totaling 46,000 acres in Washington and Oregon. In January 2019, Fund IV closed on the acquisition of a 7,100-acre property in western Washington. When referring to all the Funds collectively, depending on context, we use the designations “Fund” or “Funds” interchangeably. The Partnership holds ownership interests of 20% in Fund II, 5% in Fund III, and 15% in Fund IV. The Funds’ assets at December 31, 2018, consist of 134,000 acres of timberland as outlined in the table below:

Fund | AcquisitionDate | Location | Acres(in thousands)
Fund II | Q4 2009 | Northwestern Oregon | 5 
 | Q3 2010 | Western Washington | 13 
 | Q3 2010 | Northwestern Oregon | 13 
 | | Fund II total | 31 
Fund III | Q4 2012 | Northern California | 19 
 | Q4 2013 | Southwestern Washington | 10 
 | Q4 2014 | Northwestern Oregon | 13 
 | Q4 2015 | Southern Puget Sound Washington | 15 
 | | Fund III total | 57 
Fund IV | Q1 2018 | Southwestern Oregon | 20 
 | Q1 2018 | Southern Puget Sound Washington | 17 
 | Q4 2018 | Southern Puget Sound Washington | 9 
 | | Fund IV total | 46 
 | | Funds total | 134 


When referring to the Partnership and Fund tree farms together we refer to them as the “Combined tree farms”. When referring to the combination of the Partnership’s tree farms and its 20%, 5%, and 15% ownership interest in Fund II, Fund III, and Fund IV, respectively, we will refer to the sums as “Look-through” totals. Fund IV acquired its first timberland property in January 2018 and, as such, the information presented in the following tables for 2017 include only Fund II and Fund III.
Operations. As indicated above, operations in these two segments consist primarily of growing, managing, harvesting, and marketing timber from multiple tree farms owned by the Partnership and our private equity timber funds. These segments generated the following percentage of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:

 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Partnership Timber | 44% | 38% | 45% 
Funds Timber | 48% | 33% | 26% 

Delivered log sales to domestic manufacturers and export brokers represent the overwhelming majority of timber revenue, but we also occasionally sell rights to harvest timber from our tree farms, known as “timber deed sales”. In addition, our tree farms generate revenue from commercial thinning operations, sales of other minor forest products, ground leases for cellular communication towers, and royalties from gravel mines and quarries. 
Inventory. Timber volume is generally expressed in thousands of board feet (MBF) or millions of board feet (MMBF) using long-log Scribner scale rules common to western Washington and western Oregon. In the discussion below, we present merchantable volume, productive acres, and projected harvest level data for the Partnership’s and the Funds’ tree farms on a stand-alone and Look-through basis. On our Washington and Oregon tree farms, which we manage on an even-aged basis, we define “merchantable volume” to mean timber inventory in productive stands that are 35 years of age and older. Fund III’s California tree farm has been managed historically using an uneven-aged harvest regime wherein stands consist of trees of a variety of age classes. On that tree farm, we classify merchantable volume based on the tree’s diameter at breast height (DBH), or four and one-half feet above ground. Trees with a DBH greater than or equal to 16 inches are considered merchantable and less than 16 inches are considered pre-merchantable. Accordingly, merchantable volume from Fund III’s California tree farm is reflected in the tables below as “16+ inches”.

Merchantable volume estimates are updated quarterly. Changes in merchantable volume estimates reflect depletion of harvested timber, growth of standing timber, transitions of timber stands from pre-merchantable to merchantable, revised estimates of acres available for harvest, timber inventory measurement (cruising) updates, and timberland acquisition and disposition activity. A portion of each tree farm’s timber stands is physically measured or re-measured each year using a statistical sampling process called “cruising”. Stands with actual volume are generally cruised every seven years. The comparison of actual volume harvested to the volume carried in our inventory system is referred to as a “cutout analysis”; a quarterly analysis used to monitor the accuracy of our inventory process. Over the last five years, our overall inventory 
5

variances from the cutout analysis have been up to approximately 8% in any one year, but have averaged less than 5% in the aggregate over that time frame.
The dominant timber species on the Partnership’s tree farms is Douglas-fir, which has unique growth and structural characteristics that make it generally preferable to other softwoods for producing construction grade lumber and plywood. A secondary softwood conifer species on the Partnership’s tree farms is western hemlock, which is similar in color and structural characteristics to several other minor softwood conifer timber species, including the true firs. These secondary species are referred to generically as “whitewoods”. Western red cedar is another softwood conifer species found on the Partnership’s tree farms. Western red cedar is used in siding, fencing, and decking applications. Hardwood species on the Partnership’s tree farms include primarily red alder and smaller volumes of other hardwood species.
The merchantable timber inventory on Fund properties contains a greater proportion of whitewoods than do the Partnership’s timberlands. The most significant contributor to the Funds’ whitewood volume is from white fir on Fund III’s tree farm in northern California. Given that the Partnership holds only a 5% ownership in Fund III, on a Look-through basis the Funds contribute a more equally-weighted species mix between Douglas-fir and whitewoods. White fir is a member of the whitewood species group and is used primarily for lumber and core layers in plywood.

The Partnership’s tree farms as of December 31, 2018, consist of 103,100 available acres, representing 83% of total acres, that are designated as available acres, meaning land that will grow timber where harvesting that timber is not constrained by physical, environmental, or regulatory restrictions. The Funds’ tree farms as of December 31, 2018, totaled 114,500 available acres, representing 86% of total acres. On a Look-through basis, this results in 116,600 available acres, of which over 23% contain merchantable timber. In addition, another 25% of the Look-through productive acres are in the 25-34 year age-class, much of which will begin moving from pre-merchantable to merchantable timber volume over the next five to ten years. There is no age-class associated with the California tree farm because of the historic uneven-aged management regime, resulting in stands that contain timber with multiple ages. Productive acres for our California tree farm are shown in the following tables under the heading “California”.
Productive acres are spread by timber age-class as follows as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Site Index. The site index for a given acre of timberland is a measure of the soil’s potential to grow timber in a given location. In our Washington and Oregon operating regions, site index is expressed in feet reflecting the measured or projected height of a Douglas-fir tree at age 50. In the California region, it is based on a mix of species. Site index is calculated by tree height and age data collected during the cruising process. Site index measurements are grouped into five site classes and are an 
8

important input into models used for projecting harvest levels on all tree farms. The following table presents site class information for the Partnership and the Funds, and on a Look-through basis.

Long-term Harvest Planning. Long-term harvest plans for the Partnership’s and the Funds’ tree farms are based on the different ownership time horizons associated with each group. Plans for Partnership timberlands are designed to maintain sustainable harvest levels over an extended time frame, assuming perpetual ownership. “Sustainable harvest level” denotes our assessment of the annual volume of timber that can be harvested from a tree farm in perpetuity. As such, the sustainable harvest level generally resembles the annual growth of merchantable timber. Actual annual harvest levels may vary depending on log market conditions and timberland acquisition or disposition activity. Over multi-year time frames, however, annual harvest volumes will average out to the sustainable harvest levels developed in our long-term harvest plan. In addition, we strategically harvest timber on our Real Estate properties. The Real Estate volume and productive acres, while included in the above merchantable volume tables, are not used to calculate our long-term sustainable harvest level as it has been designated for potential sale as HBU real estate rather than perpetual timber operations.
The harvest levels for the Funds’ tree farms are developed to maximize the total return during the investment period of each fund by blending cash flow from harvest with the value of the portfolio upon disposition. This will result in more harvest variability between years for Fund tree farms than is the case with the Partnership’s tree farms.
We periodically review the sustainable harvest level for the Partnership and the Funds. In the latter part of 2018, we completed the most recent review of the Partnership’s sustainable harvest level. With the addition of small-tract acquisitions over the past few years, continued improvements in our inventory data and growth-and-yield modeling, and recent investments in silviculture, we increased the Partnership’s annual sustainable harvest level to 57 MMBF, a 10% increase from the prior 52 MMBF level. This change is effective for our 2019 harvest. Assuming full operations on the Funds’ existing tree farms, at December 31, 2018, the long-term planned average annual harvest volume for the Partnership and Fund tree farms (and on a Look-through basis) is presented in the table below:

 | | Look-through 
(amounts in MMBF) | Planned annual harvest volume | planned annual harvest volume
Partnership tree farms | 57 | 57 
Fund tree farms | 93 | 12 
Total | 150 | 69 


Marketing and Markets. The following discussion applies to the Combined tree farms. We sell logs to lumber, plywood, and chip producers and to log export brokers. To do so, we engage independent logging contractors to harvest the standing timber, manufacture that timber into logs, and deliver the logs to our customers. Except in the case of some timber deed sales, we retain title to the logs until they are delivered to a customer’s log yard.
Domestic mills buy the majority of our sawlog volume. These customers use the logs as raw material for manufacturing lumber. Higher quality logs sold to the domestic market are generally used to peel veneer necessary to manufacture plywood or specialized beams. Lumber markets tend to rise and fall with new home starts and the repair and remodel market, which in turn drives domestic demand for logs. Additional domestic demand for our logs comes from 
9

producers of utility poles and cedar fencing. Our lowest quality logs are chipped for use by pulp mills in the production of pulp and paper.
We also sell logs to export markets in Asia through brokers based in the Pacific Northwest. Our decision to sell through intermediaries is predicated on risk management considerations, such as mitigation of foreign exchange risk, loss prevention, and minimizing cash collection risks. These export markets generally represent 15% to 35% of the log volume we produce but can reach as high as 50%. Export markets provide important diversification from our domestic markets. Drivers of export markets include construction activities in Japan, China, and Korea, exchange rates, tariffs, and shipping costs. Export markets do not tend to correlate with our domestic markets which is why the diversification provided by these markets is valuable.
Historically, Japanese customers have paid a premium for the highest quality Douglas-fir logs from which they mill visually appealing exposed beams used for residential construction. U.S. mills, on the other hand, manufacture mostly framing lumber requiring structural integrity for wall systems or trusses that are ultimately concealed by drywall and thus do not require high aesthetic quality. Accordingly, the logs sold to domestic markets are more of a commodity relative to logs sold to the Japanese market, and thus do not command as high a price. 
Beginning in 2010, a reduction in China’s log imports from Russia, coupled with a strengthening Chinese currency compared to the U.S. dollar, opened an opportunity for North American log producers to supply a larger portion of logs to the growing Chinese market. This resulted in the migration of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) export market from one focused almost exclusively on Japan and Korea to a broader Asian market that now includes China. Today, China represents the largest export market for PNW sawlogs in Asia. Notwithstanding recent tariffs, and threats of additional tariffs, imposed on U.S. logs exported to China, this export market has provided additional support to log prices during the gradual recovery of U.S. housing over the past several years. Sawlogs sold to China are used chiefly for construction of concrete forms, pallets, and other uses that can be satisfied with whitewood and lower quality Douglas-fir sawlogs.
Customers. Logs from the Combined tree farms are sold to customers in both the domestic and export markets. Domestic customers include lumber and plywood mills and other wood fiber processors located throughout western Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Export customers consist of intermediaries located at the Washington ports of Longview, Tacoma, Port Angeles, Grays Harbor, and Olympia, and the Oregon port of Astoria. Whether destined for domestic or export markets, the cost of transporting logs limits the destinations to which the Partnership and Funds can profitably deliver and sell their logs.
The ultimate decision on where to sell logs is based on the net proceeds we receive after considering both the delivered log prices and the cost to deliver the logs to that customer. In instances where harvest operations are closer to a domestic mill than the log yard of an export broker, we may earn a higher margin from selling to a domestic mill even though the delivered log price is lower. As such, realized delivered log price movements are influenced by marketing decisions predicated on margins rather than focusing exclusively on the delivered log price. In such instances, our reported delivered log prices may reflect both the proximity of the harvest location to customers and the broader market trend.
Competition. Most of our competitors are comparable to us in size or larger. Log sellers like the Partnership and the Funds compete on the basis of quality, pricing, and the ability to satisfy volume demands for various types and grades of logs to particular markets. We believe that the location, type, and grade of timber from the Combined tree farms helps us compete effectively in these markets. However, our products are subject to competition from foreign-produced logs and lumber as well as a variety of non-wood building products.
Forestry, Silviculture, and Stewardship Practices. Silviculture activities on the Combined tree farms include reforestation, control of competing brush in young stands, and density management (thinning) of forests to achieve optimal spacing after stands are established. This is all to ensure that young stands are on a pathway to produce the desired log sorts and species mix. We manage our forests to create a species mix and log top-end diameters of a size and quality that we predict will satisfy what domestic mills and export markets will desire in future years. During 2018, we planted 1.8 million seedlings on 5,500 acres of the Combined tree farms compared to 1.9 million seedlings on 6,300 acres in 2017 and 1.7 million seedlings on 6,600 acres in 2016. Seedlings are generally planted from December to April to restock stands that were harvested during the preceding twelve months. The number of seedlings planted varies from year to year based upon harvest level, the timing of harvest, seedling availability, and weather and soil conditions that control the timing of reforestation. Our policy is to return all timberlands to productive status in the first planting season after harvest, provided any requisite brush control has been completed and seedlings are available.
Harvest and road construction activities are conducted in compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Many of these regulations are programmatic and include, for example: limitations on the size of harvest areas, 
10

reforestation following harvest, retention of trees for wildlife habitat and water quality, and sediment management on forest roads. Regulations also require project-specific permits or notifications that govern a defined set of forestry operations. An application for harvest or road construction may require specific controls to avoid potential impact to the environment.
Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®). Since 2003, we have been a member of the SFI® forest certification program; an independent environmental review and certification program that promotes sustainable forest management, focusing on water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and the protection of unique biota. With our participation in this certification program, we are subject to annual independent audits of the standards required by the program. We view this certification as an important indication of our commitment to manage our lands sustainably while continually seeking ways to improve our management practices. We believe this commitment is an important business practice that contributes to our reputation and to the long-term value of our assets. Our certifications are current for all the Combined tree farms. 
Timberland Investment Management (TIM)
Background. Our TIM segment provides timberland investment management services for third-parties, for which it earns management fees and incurs expenses resulting from raising, investing, and managing capital which is invested in Pacific Northwest timberland on behalf of third-party investors alongside the Partnership’s co-investment. Since the launch of our private equity timber fund strategy in 2003, the activities in this segment have consisted primarily of raising third-party investment capital for the Funds and then acquiring and managing timberland portfolios on their behalf. When we discuss the Fund properties we will refer to either the acquisition values, defined as contractually agreed-upon prices paid for the properties, or the value of assets under management, defined as the current third-party appraised value of the properties. As of December 31, 2018, we manage 134,000 acres of timberland in Washington, Oregon, and California with combined appraised values of $526 million. Following the January 2019 acquisition by Fund IV, we manage over 141,000 acres with combined appraised values of $547 million.
The following table summarizes the committed and called capital for the TIM segment on a cumulative basis since its inception, as well as distributions received by the Partnership, as of December 31, 2018 as well as January 31, 2019, which incorporates the recent timberland acquisition by Fund IV:

 | Total Fund | | Partnership Co-investment
(in millions) | Commitment | | Called Capital | | Commitment | | Called Capital | DistributionsReceived | | Ownership Percentage
Fund I * | $ | 61.8 | | | $ | 58.5 | | $ | 12.4 | | $ | 11.7 | | $ | 15.1 | 20%
Fund II | 84.4 | | | 83.4 | | | 16.9 | | 16.7 | | 14.4 | | 20%
Fund III | 180.0 | | | 179.7 | | | 9.0 | | 9.0 | | 1.3 | | 5% 
Fund IV | 388.0 | | | 146.9 | | | 58.0 | | 22.0 | | 0.4 | | 15%
Total, December 31, 2018 | 714.2 | | | 468.5 | | | 96.3 | | 59.4 | | 31.2 | | 
January 2019 Fund IV acquisition | — | | | 20.3 | | | — | | 3.0 | | — | | 
 | $ | 714.2 | | | $ | 488.8 | | $ | 96.3 | | $ | 62.4 | | $ | 31.2 | 

* Fund I assets were sold in 2014 and the fund was wound up in 2015.
Operations. The TIM segment’s key activity is to provide investment and portfolio management services to the Funds. We anticipate growth in this segment as we continue to place the remaining $221 million of Fund IV committed capital, after the January 2019 timberland acquisition, together with any future funds established by the Partnership. The TIM segment represented less than 1% of consolidated revenue for each of the three years ended December 31, 2016 through 2018, as fee revenue is eliminated in consolidation. On an internal reporting basis, before these eliminations, the TIM segment represented 4%, 3%, and 4% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
The Partnership benefits in several ways from this segment. First, the Partnership co-invests in each of these funds, allowing us to diversify our market exposure across a wider geography and more frequent acquisitions than we could by investing Partnership capital alone. We also benefit from the economies of scale generated through managing these additional acres of timberland, which benefit both the Partnership and Fund timberlands. The contribution margin from the fees charged to the Funds lowers the management costs on the Partnership’s timberlands. Lastly, we retain additional expertise that neither the Partnership nor the Funds’ timberlands could support on a stand-alone basis.
11

The Partnership earns annual asset management fees from the Funds based on the equity capital used to acquire timberland properties. The Partnership also earns timberland management fees on acres owned by the Funds and log marketing fees based on harvest volume from Fund tree farms. At the end of a Fund term, if a Fund exceeds threshold return levels, the Partnership earns a carried interest incentive fee.
Accounting rules require that we eliminate in consolidation the fee revenue generated from managing the Funds in our TIM segment and corresponding operating expenses for the Funds Timber segment. The elimination of the fee revenue and corresponding operating expenses reduces the reported cost per acre of operating Fund tree farms under our Fee Timber segment. These eliminations make the Funds Timber results appear stronger and the TIM results appear correspondingly weaker.

Marketing. When raising capital for a new Fund, we market opportunities to investors that desire to invest alongside the Partnership in Pacific Northwest (PNW) timberland assets. Our Funds fill a niche among timberland investment management organizations due to our PNW regional specialization, degree of co-investment, and the ability to target relatively small transactions. Additional marketing and business development efforts include regular contact with forest products industry representatives, non-industry owners, and others who provide key financial services to the timberland sector. Our acquisition and disposition activities keep management informed of changes in timberland ownership that can represent opportunities for us to market our services.
Customers. The Funds are the primary customers and users of TIM services. Investors in the Funds are primarily large institutional investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, and endowments.
Competition. We compete against both larger and comparably sized companies providing similar timberland investment management services. There are over 20 established timberland investment management organizations competing with us in this business. Some companies in this group have access to established sources of capital and, in some cases, increased economies of scale that can put us at a disadvantage. Our value proposition to investors is centered on the differentiation we provide relative to other managers, as described above, as well as our long track record of success in the Pacific Northwest.

Real Estate
Background. The Partnership’s real estate activities are associated closely with the management of our timberlands. After timberland has been logged, we choose among four primary alternatives to generate value from the underlying land: reforest and continue to operate as timberland, sell as undeveloped property, undertake some level of development to prepare the land for sale as improved property, or hold for later development or sale. We regularly evaluate our timberland for its best economic use. We currently have a 2,000-acre portfolio of properties for which we believe there to be a higher and better use than timberland. In addition, we may acquire and develop other properties for sale, either on our own or by partnering with other experienced real estate developers. To date, this activity has not constituted a material part of our Real Estate segment’s operations.
The Real Estate segment’s activities generally consist of investing in, and later selling, improved properties as well as holding properties for later development and sale. As a result, revenue from this segment tends to fluctuate substantially, and is characterized by periods during which revenue is low, while costs incurred to increase the value of our development properties may be higher. During periods of diminished demand, we manage our entitlement related costs and infrastructure investment to minimize negative cash flows. Segment expenses do not generally trend directly with segment revenues. When improved properties are sold, income is recognized in the form of sale price net of acquisition and development costs.
Operations. The Real Estate segment represented 8%, 26%, and 29% of consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Real Estate operations focus on maximizing the value of the 2,000-acre portfolio mentioned above. For Real Estate projects, we secure entitlements and/or infrastructure necessary to make development possible and then sell the entitled property to a party who will construct improvements. This segment’s results also reflect conservation-related transactions with respect to our timberland. These transactions can take the form of sales of timberland for conservation purposes, sales of conservation easements (CE) that encumber Partnership Timber properties and preclude future development but allow continued harvest operations, or sales of timberland on which we retain the right to harvest the standing timber for a period of time, typically up to 25 years. The third and final area of operations in this segment includes leasing residential and commercial properties in Port Gamble, Washington, and leasing out a portion of our corporate headquarters building in Poulsbo, Washington.

We recognize the significant value represented by the Partnership’s Real Estate holdings and are focused on adding to that value. The means and methods of adding value to this portfolio vary considerably depending on the specific location and zoning of each parcel. Our properties range from land that has commercial activity zoning where unit values are measured on a per-square-foot basis to large lots of recently harvested timberland where value is measured in per-acre terms. In general, value-adding activities that allow for development of the properties include: working with communities and elected officials to develop grass roots support for entitlement efforts, securing favorable comprehensive plan designation and zoning, acquiring easements, and obtaining plat approvals.
Information about the location and zoning categories of our Real Estate portfolio is set forth in Part I, Item 2: “Properties.”
Development Properties
Projects in Gig Harbor, Port Gamble, Kingston, Bremerton, Hansville, and Port Ludlow, Washington comprise approximately half the acres in our development property portfolio. Depending on each property’s size, development complexity, and regulatory environment, a project may be long-term in nature and require extensive time and capital investments to maximize returns.
Gig Harbor. Gig Harbor, a suburb of Tacoma, Washington, is the site of Harbor Hill, a 292-acre mixed-use development project that, at its inception, included the following mix of zoning: 42 acres of commercial/retail sites, 50 acres of business park lots, and 200 acres of land with residential zoning. At December 31, 2018, we still own 18.5 acres of commercial/retail and 21.6 acres of residential lots in this project. A 20-year development agreement was approved by the City of Gig Harbor (City) in late 2010. Key provisions of the development agreement and plat approval include: (a) extending the project development period from 7 to 20 years; (b) reserving sufficient domestic water supply, sanitary sewer, and traffic trip capacity on behalf of the project’s residential units; and (c) waiver of park impact fees in exchange for a 7-acre parcel of land for City park purposes. All components of this project have transportation, water, and sewer capacities reserved for full build-out. We received preliminary plat approval in early 2011 for the then 200-acre residential portion of this project that included 554 single-family and 270 multi-family units. At December 31, 2018, the final 65 single-family lots on over 21 acres are nearing completion and are under contract for $12 million. The last 18 acres in the master plan was entitled for a grocery-anchored shopping center in late summer 2018 and was part of a joint venture with another developer. The project is currently on hold as a result of construction cost increases and a proposed doubling of traffic impact fees by the City of Gig Harbor. A smaller project is currently being evaluated for the site.
Port Gamble. Port Gamble fits within both the development and commercial properties aspects of our Real Estate operations. Port Gamble is located northwest of Kingston in Kitsap County. Founded in 1853 by the company that became Pope & Talbot, Inc. (“P&T”), Port Gamble served as a company town for over 140 years, and a mill site and logging port for much of that time, with many of its buildings still standing. The town and mill sites, totaling 113 acres, were acquired from P&T at the time of the Partnership’s formation in 1985. The operation and management of the town of Port Gamble is discussed under “Commercial Properties” below.
With respect to our development plans for the site, Port Gamble may be sold on a bulk-sale basis to a developer interested in taking the project forward, or development may take place under a joint venture with a developer or using third-party capital, with the Partnership seeking to limit its own capital in this development. Port Gamble has been designated a “Rural Historic Town” under Washington’s Growth Management Act since 1999. This designation allows for substantial new commercial, industrial, and residential development using historic land use patterns and densities while maintaining the town’s unique architectural character. On September 6, 2018, we submitted the master plan for the 113-acre townsite and adjoining 205-acre agrarian district to Kitsap County for review. Our plans are focused on bringing back the New England-style homes that have slowly disappeared since Port Gamble’s heyday in the 1920s. If approved as proposed, our plat application to Kitsap County will allow for between 200 and 240 additional residential units and 200,000 to 260,000 square feet of additional commercial building space. The proposal also calls for the development of homes, an inn, a dock, waterfront trails, and an agricultural area with greenhouses, orchard, and winery. Walking trails along the shoreline, through the adjoining forestlands, and along pastoral farmland would contribute to the lifestyle of residents and should enhance Port Gamble as a unique tourist attraction. In 2016, the town was connected to the Kitsap County water supply infrastructure. During 2017, a new membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment plant with a large onsite septic system was installed and turned over to Kitsap County’s Public Utility District, and the former treatment plant was de-commissioned.
As discussed in greater detail below, P&T’s operations at Port Gamble, prior to the Partnership’s ownership of the millsite and surrounding areas, resulted in the release of hazardous substances that impacted the upland and submerged portions of the site, and we have an environmental remediation liability as a result of our ownership of Port Gamble. 
13

Kingston. The Partnership owns a 374-acre property in Kingston called “Arborwood” with plans for the development of 663 single-family lots and 88 multi-family units. In 2016, we acquired an adjacent 10 acres to provide another access point to the project and allow it to be divided into three or more smaller projects. Like Port Gamble, we may sell Arborwood on a bulk-sale basis to a developer interested in taking the project forward, or we may develop it under a joint venture with a developer or using third-party capital. An amendment to the preliminary plat was submitted in late 2018. We plan to prepare engineering and construction drawings for the first phase of lot development in 2019, with the goal of starting construction in 2020.
Bremerton. The West Hills area of Bremerton, Washington is the site of a 46-acre industrial park which we have been developing in two phases totaling 24 lots. Construction on the 9 lots covering 10 acres that comprise Phase I was completed in 2007 and four lots have been sold to date. In 2013, we obtained a comprehensive plan designation change from industrial to residential for the 35-acre Phase II portion of this property. In 2014, Phase II was rezoned to single-family residential. In 2018, we sold this phase to a commercial developer.
Hansville. The Partnership owns a 149-acre residential development project in Hansville called “Chatham,” with 19 parcels ranging from 3 to 10 acres in size. Construction was completed in late 2007, and the lots are currently being marketed for sale. As of December 31, 2018, 13 lots have been sold.
Port Ludlow. Port Ludlow represents a 256-acre property in Jefferson County located just outside the Master Planned Resort boundary of Port Ludlow, Washington. Development of the property will progress commensurate with demand for rural residential lots in this area.
Rural Residential. We have a number of saleable properties totaling 962 acres for which rural residential development represents a higher and better use compared to continued management as timberland. In general, these properties are non-contiguous smaller lots ranging in size between 5 and 40 acres with zoning ranging from one dwelling unit per 5 acres to one per 80 acres. Development and disposition strategies vary depending on the property’s unique characteristics. Development efforts and costs incurred to prepare these properties for sale include work to obtain development entitlements that will increase the property’s value as residential property as well as making improvements to existing logging roads, constructing new roads, and extending dry utilities. As is the case with much of the Real Estate portfolio, investments in the rural residential program have been limited to those necessary to achieve entitlements, while deferring construction costs until warranted by market conditions.
North Kitsap County. Since 2011, we have been formally engaged with a coalition of approximately 30 entities to conserve up to 6,500 acres of the Partnership’s timberland in north Kitsap County. This effort, known as the Kitsap Forest & Bay Project, saw two closings in 2014 totaling 901 acres. In 2015, an additional 175 acres were sold to Kitsap County utilizing state conservation funds, and in 2016 we sold 1,356 acres to Kitsap County, though we retained a timber deed that will allow us to harvest timber on the property for 25 years. In December 2017, we sold an additional 1,504 acres to Kitsap County and retained a timber deed that will allow us to harvest timber on 1,334 acres of the property for 25 years.
Skamania County. We have been engaged with the Columbia Land Trust in a multi-phase conservation project that includes both fee and conservation easement (CE) sales of the Partnership’s timberland in the area. Funding for conservation sales are made available primarily through the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Program. In tandem with this project, we worked with Skamania County to rezone 7,899 acres of our holdings in that county. In 2018, we completed a CE sale on that property.
Commercial Properties
Poulsbo. In May 2011, we purchased a 30,000-square-foot commercial office building in Poulsbo, on a 2-acre parcel of land. We utilize the second floor, basement, and part of the first floor for our own operations. We lease the remaining portion of the first floor to two separate tenants.
Port Gamble. As described above under “Development Properties,” the Partnership owns and operates the town of Port Gamble where 25 residential buildings and approximately 46,000 square feet of commercial space are currently leased to third parties. In addition, we operate a wedding and events business, utilizing another 8,000 square feet in the town’s venues that leverages the charm of the townsite to attract clientele, and a museum. These commercial activities help offset the costs of maintaining the town while the master plan progresses.
14

Environmental Remediation. As noted above, P&T and its corporate predecessors operated a sawmill at Port Gamble from 1853 to 1995. P&T continued to lease various portions of the site for its operations until 2002. During the time P&T operated in Port Gamble, it also conducted shipping, log storage, and log transfer operations in the tidal and subtidal waters of Port Gamble Bay, some of which were under a lease from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that lasted from 1974 to 2004. P&T’s operations resulted in the release of hazardous substances that impacted the upland and submerged portions of the site. These substances include various hydrocarbons, cadmium, and toxins associated with wood waste and the production of wood products.
Following the mill shutdown, the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) began to examine the environmental conditions at Port Gamble. Under Washington law, both Pope Resources and P&T were considered by DOE to be “potentially liable persons” (PLPs); the Partnership because of its ownership of certain portions of the site, and P&T because of its historical ownership and operation of the site. 
P&T and Pope Resources entered into a settlement agreement in 2002 that allocated responsibility for environmental contamination at the townsite, millsite, a solid waste landfill, and adjacent waters, with P&T assuming responsibility for funding cleanup in the Bay and the other areas of the site that were impacted by its historical operations. At that time, the parties estimated the aggregate cleanup costs allocable to both parties to be between $10 million and $13 million, with the clean-up of Port Gamble Bay expected to amount to approximately 90% of the overall project costs.
In 2005, both Pope Resources and P&T received Environmental Excellence Awards from DOE for their work in remediating the contamination that had existed at the Port Gamble townsite and landfill. DOE also issued letters to both parties in 2006 indicating that the agency expected to take no further action regarding conditions at those portions of the site. Pope Resources continued cleaning up the remaining contamination at the millsite. By late 2005, the millsite portion of the site had largely been cleaned and the remaining aspects of that project consisted of test well monitoring and modest additional remediation. The Port Gamble Bay area and related tidelands, for which P&T was responsible under the parties’ settlement agreement, had not yet been remediated. In 2007, P&T filed for bankruptcy protection and was eventually liquidated, leaving the Partnership as the only remaining PLP. Because environmental liabilities are joint and several as between PLPs, the result of P&T’s bankruptcy was to leave the liability with the Partnership as the only remaining solvent PLP. At that time, we increased our accrual for remediation liabilities by $1.9 million to reflect the resulting increase in risk.
In-water cleanup
Beginning in 2010, DOE began to reconsider its expectations regarding the level of cleanup that would be required for Port Gamble Bay, largely because of input from interested citizens and groups, one of the most prominent of which has been the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe. In response to input from these groups, DOE adopted remediation levels that were far more stringent than either DOE or the Partnership had contemplated previously. This culminated in significant modifications to the cleanup alternatives in the draft Port Gamble Bay and Mill Site Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study issued by DOE in May 2012. As a result, we recorded a $12.5 million increase in our accrual for the environmental remediation liability in the second quarter of 2012.
In December 2013, the Partnership and DOE entered into a consent decree that included a cleanup action plan (CAP) requiring the removal of docks and pilings, excavation and backfilling of intertidal areas, subtidal dredging and monitoring, and other specific remediation steps. Throughout 2014, we evaluated the requirements of the CAP and conducted additional sampling and investigation to design the remediation project. In November 2014, we submitted a draft engineering design report (EDR) to DOE, followed by other supplemental materials establishing our proposed means for complying with the CAP. Based on the EDR and subsequent discussions with DOE, we reached the conclusion that the existing accrual for environmental liabilities was insufficient. Accordingly, we accrued an additional $10.0 million in December 2014. The construction phase of the cleanup of the Port Gamble Bay area and related tidelands began in September 2015 and the in-water portion of the cleanup was completed in January 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we accrued an additional $7.7 million, primarily representing costs associated with removing pilings and dredging and capping an area of deep wood waste discovered along the southern embankment of the millsite, as well as estimated additional long-term monitoring costs.
Millsite cleanup
With the in-water portion of the cleanup completed, there will be relatively modest cleanup activity on the millsite and a monitoring period. In February 2018, the Partnership and DOE entered into an agreed order with respect to the millsite under which the Partnership performed a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) which it submitted to DOE for review in January 2019. Following the finalization of the RI/FS, the Partnership will work with DOE to develop a CAP. As with the in-
15

water portion of the project, the CAP will define the scope of the remediation activity for the millsite. Once the CAP is approved by DOE, it will be codified in a consent decree.
Natural Resource Damages (NRD)
Certain environmental laws allow state, federal, and tribal trustees (collectively, the Trustees) to bring suit against property owners to recover damages for injuries to natural resources. Like the liability that attaches to current property owners in the cleanup context, liability for NRD can attach to a property owner simply because an injury to natural resources resulted from releases of hazardous substances on that owner’s property, regardless of culpability for the release. The Trustees are alleging that Pope Resources has NRD liability because of releases that occurred on its property. We have been in discussions with the Trustees regarding their claims, and the alleged conditions in Port Gamble Bay. We have also been discussing restoration alternatives that might address the damages that the Trustees allege.
We accrued an additional $5.6 million in 2018 as a result of updates to our estimates of costs associated with the cleanup of the millsite and estimated NRD costs. It is reasonably possible that these components of the liability may increase as the project progresses. With the in-water cleanup completed, which was by the far the most significant component of the project, and the 2018 adjustments, however, we expect that any future adjustments to the liability should be less significant than they have been historically.
Additional information regarding this environmental remediation liability, and the methodology used to monitor its adequacy, is set forth in Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Real Estate” and “– Critical Accounting Estimates”.
Marketing. Marketing efforts for development properties from 2016 to 2018 were focused primarily on our Harbor Hill development and conservation land and easement sales. During this period, we also started investigating and pursuing the acquisition and development of other real estate properties (not owned by the Partnership) and closed on the acquisition of a two-acre parcel on Bainbridge Island, Washington. In 2017, we partnered with another developer to form a joint venture for the acquisition of a 5-acre property on Bainbridge Island, Washington, that will include 18 townhomes for sale and 107 apartments for lease. Efforts were also expended in the last several years to sell North Kitsap lands for conservation.
Customers. We typically market properties from the Real Estate portfolio to private individuals, residential contractors, and commercial developers. Customers for rental space in the Port Gamble townsite consist of both residential and commercial tenants.
Competition. We compete in this segment with local and regional peers that offer land for sale or lease.
Transportation. Land values for the Real Estate portfolio are influenced by transportation options between the west side of Puget Sound, where our properties are located, and the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan corridor. These areas are separated by bodies of water. Transportation options include the Tacoma Narrows Bridge or one of several car and passenger ferries that link the communities of Kingston, Bremerton, and Bainbridge Island to Edmonds and Seattle. A new passenger ferry with 40-minute travel time from Kingston to downtown Seattle started in late 2018 and should have positive impacts on the desirability of the company’s holdings in North Kitsap County.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we employed 62 full-time employees and 3 part-time or seasonal personnel, who are distributed among the segments as follows:

Segment | Full-Time | Part-Time/Seasonal | | Total
Partnership Timber | 22 | | 1 | | 23
Timberland Investment Management (TIM) | 11 | | — | | 11
Real Estate | 14 | | 2 | | 16
General & Administrative | 15 | | — | | 15
Totals | 62 | | 3 | | 65

Our Funds Timber segment does not have employees. Rather, this segment is served by employees from the TIM and Partnership Timber segments. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the Partnership has no knowledge that any steps toward unionization are in progress. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation
Our timberland and real estate operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern forest practices and land use. These laws and regulations can directly and indirectly affect our Partnership Timber, Funds Timber, and TIM segments by regulating harvest levels and impacting the market values of forest products and forestland. Our Real Estate operations are also directly and indirectly affected by these laws and regulations by limiting development opportunities and the underlying market value of real estate.
Laws and Regulations that Affect Our Forestry Operations. Our Partnership Timber, Funds Timber, and TIM segments are affected by federal and state laws and regulations that are designed to promote air and water quality and protect endangered and threatened species. Further, each state in which we own or manage timberland has developed “best management practices” (BMP) to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and plant and animal habitat. Collectively, these laws and regulations affect our harvest and forest management activities. At times, regulatory agencies and citizens’ and environmental groups seek to expand regulations using a wide variety of judicial, legislative, and administrative processes, as well as state ballot initiatives, a process applicable to all three states in which we operate, that allows citizens to adopt laws without legislative or administrative action.
The primary laws and regulations that affect our forestry operations include:
Endangered Species Laws
A number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws. Federal ESA listings include the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, numerous salmon species, bull trout, steelhead trout, and other species. At times, state endangered species laws impose further restrictions by limiting the proximity of harvest operations to certain plants and wildlife. Legislative, regulatory, and legal efforts to expand the list of protected species and populations may impose further restrictions. Federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species have imposed restrictions on timber harvest on some of our timberlands, and these protections may be expanded in ways that further affect our operations. These actions may increase our operating costs, further restrict timber harvests or reduce available acres, and adversely affect supply and demand more broadly across our markets.
Further, federal and state regulatory agencies monitor environmental conditions to determine whether existing forest practice rules are effective at protecting threatened and endangered wildlife. New or modified regulations could result in increased costs, additional capital expenditures, and reduced operating flexibility.
Water Quality Laws
Also affecting our forestry operations are laws and regulations that are designed to protect water quality. The preeminent federal law is the Clean Water Act (CWA), which is enforced through associated state laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These state laws and regulations reduce timberlands available for harvest by, among other things, requiring buffers on some streams to meet state water quality standards related to maintaining temperature or reducing or eliminating turbidity. Other laws and regulations could have significant impacts on our harvest activities, including increases in setback requirements. As these rules grow more restrictive, we may face increasing costs associated with our silviculture, may find some areas of our tree farms inaccessible (either physically or because of economic inefficiency), and may face reductions in the portion of our timberlands that can be harvested.
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and other state laws related to the use of pesticides restrict the use of herbicides. Herbicides are used to promote reforestation and to optimize the growth of regenerated stands of trees. FIFRA and state laws and regulations may reduce the efficiency with which we can produce timber, and they may ultimately reduce the volume of timber that is available for harvest. Further limits to the use of insecticides or herbicides may make our tree farms more vulnerable to disease or infestations.

State Harvest Permitting Processes
Washington, Oregon, and California all have a permitting or notification system as part of their forest practice rules. Changes in these processes can cause additional administrative expenses and/or delay project implementation. These rules may require significant environmental studies and permitting requirements prior to the issuance of harvest permits. All three states periodically update their regulations and permitting processes. Changes could cause us to incur expenses, and new permitting regulations commonly require us to increase the level of research and expertise necessary to meet applicable requirements. Substantive changes in these regulations may increase our harvest costs, may decrease the volume of our timber that is available for harvest, and may otherwise reduce our revenues or increase our costs of operations.
Climate Change Laws
California has implemented a cap and trade program that limits the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by certain stationary sources as well as transportation sources. This may impact forest landowners through increased costs of energy to our manufacturing customers and logging contractors. Washington state voters rejected a carbon tax initiative in 2018. The Oregon legislature is considering a cap and trade program in the 2019 session.
The effects of these laws and initiatives cannot readily be quantified or predicted. However, management does not expect to be disproportionately affected by these programs in comparison with typical timberland owners. Likewise, management does not expect that these programs will significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods.
Laws and Regulations that Affect Real Estate Development.  Many of the federal laws (ESA and CWA) that impact forest management can, in a more limited manner, also apply to real estate development. State and local land use regulations can also have additional permitting requirements and limit development opportunities. For example, development rights in Washington state are affected by the Growth Management Act (GMA), which requires counties to submit comprehensive plans that identify the future direction of growth and stipulate where population densities are to be concentrated. The purposes of the GMA include: (1) direction of population growth to population centers (Urban Growth Areas), (2) reduction of “suburban sprawl”, and (3) protection of historical sites. We work with local governments within the framework of the GMA to develop our real estate holdings to their highest and best use. Oregon also has growth management provisions in its land use laws which served as a model for Washington’s growth management provisions. Oregon’s land use laws are generally more stringent outside of urban areas, especially in commercial forest lands where residential conversions are often outright disallowed without statutory action by the State legislature. These regulations can impact the permitted density of a given area, which may affect the number of lots, dwellings, or commercial buildings that can be constructed in a given location, any or all of which may affect our real estate revenues and the value of our real estate holdings.
