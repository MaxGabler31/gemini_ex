Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage company that develops and sells high performance water solutions to the medical and commercial markets.
 
In medical markets, we sell water filtration products and waterborne pathogen detection products. Our medical water filters, mostly classified as ultrafilters, are used primarily by hospitals for the prevention of infection from waterborne pathogens, such as legionella and pseudomonas, and in dialysis centers for the removal of biological contaminants from water and bicarbonate concentrate. Because our ultrafilters capture contaminants as small as 0.005 microns in size, they minimize exposure to a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and endotoxins.
 
In commercial markets, we manufacture and sell water filters that improve the taste and odor of water and reduce biofilm, bacteria, and scale build-up in downstream equipment. Marketed under both the Nephros and AETHER brands, our products are marketed primarily to the food service, hospitality, convenience store, and health care markets.
 
Our pathogen detection systems are portable, near real-time systems designed to provide actionable data for infection control teams, biomedical engineers in dialysis clinics, and water quality teams in building management organizations.
 
We also have a subsidiary, Specialty Renal Products, Inc. (“SRP”), a development-stage medical device company, focused primarily on developing hemodiafiltration (“HDF”) technology. SRP is developing a second-generation of the Nephros OLpūr H2H Hemodiafiltration System, the FDA 510(k)-cleared medical device that enables nephrologists to provide HDF treatment to patients with end stage renal disease (“ESRD”).
 
We were founded in 1997 by healthcare professionals affiliated with Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital to develop and commercialize an alternative method to hemodialysis. We have extended our filtration technologies to meet the demand for liquid purification in other areas, in particular, water purification.
 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
Most customers and prospects – including healthcare, hospitality, and food and beverage – have re-opened to our sales activity as the country has progressed through the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our filter emergency response business has normalized. We expect the pandemic to continue its overall trend toward abatement in the coming months, but recent infection increases from new viral variants may interrupt that abatement for a period of time, as has occurred with the Delta and Omicron variants.
 
During the pandemic, we maintained full operations, supporting our customers and strategic partners, with no significant interruptions in supply chain or service capabilities.
 
We believe that, as the COVID-19 pandemic generally subsides, we may experience a net positive impact on demand for our products, due especially to increased global awareness of infectious pathogens and the serious problems they cause. Specifically, we expect that:
 

● | Purchase decisions for infection control filtration that had been deferred, both in new and existing customer organizations, may be re-prioritized. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Demand for our pathogen detection products may increase as unoccupied buildings, including office buildings and hotels, are readied for re-occupation. Extended periods of low, or no, water flow through building piping creates opportunities for biofilm propagation – a problem our strategic partners are trained to eradicate. 
● | Demand for our commercial filtration products may increase as business returns to hotels, casinos, and restaurants.

Our Products
 
Water Filtration Products
 
We develop and sell water filtration products used in both medical and commercial applications. Our water filtration products employ multiple filtration technologies, as described below.
 
In medical markets, our primary filtration mechanism is to pass liquids through the pores of polysulfone hollow fiber. Our filters’ pores are significantly smaller than those of competing products, resulting in highly effective elimination of waterborne pathogens, including legionella bacteria (the cause of Legionnaires disease) and viruses, which are not eliminated by most other microbiological filters on the market. Additionally, the fiber structure and pore density in our hollow fiber enables significantly higher flow rates than in other polysulfone hollow fiber.
 
Our primary sales strategy in medical markets is to sell through value-added resellers (“VARs”). Leveraging VARs has enabled us to expand rapidly our access to target customers without significant sales staff expansion. In addition, while we are currently focused on medical markets, the VARs that support these customers also support a wide variety of commercial and industrial customers. We believe that our VAR relationships will facilitate growth in filter sales outside of the medical industry.
 
In commercial markets, we develop and sell our Nephros- and AETHER-branded filters, for which carbon-based absorption is the primary filtration mechanism. Aether products allow us to improve water’s odor and taste, to reduce scale and heavy metals, and to reduce other water contaminants for customers who are primarily in the food service, convenience store, and hospitality industries.
 
Our Aether filter offerings have the potential to generate accretive revenue growth in at least three ways. First, we expect the business to continue its organic growth. Second, cross-selling opportunities are generated by offering taste/odor-focused products to the medical markets, as well as pathogen-focused filtration to the commercial markets. Finally, as part of the more substantial Nephros organization, Aether may be able to compete for larger filtration contracts than may have been available to it as a smaller, independent firm.
 
In commercial markets, our model combines both direct and indirect sales. Our sales staff have sold products directly to a number of convenience stores, hotels, casinos, and restaurants. We are also pursuing large corporate contracts through partnerships.
 
Target Markets
 
Our ultrafiltration products currently target the following markets:
 

● | Hospitals and Other Healthcare Facilities: Filtration of water for washing and drinking as an aid in infection control. The filters produce water that is suitable for wound cleansing, cleaning of equipment used in medical procedures, and washing of surgeons’ hands. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Dialysis Centers: Filtration of water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis. 
● | Commercial and Industrial Facilities: Filtration and purification of water for consumption, including for use in ice machines and soft drink dispensers. 
● | Military and Outdoor Recreation: Individual water purification devices used by soldiers and backpackers to produce drinking water in the field, as well as filters customized to remote water processing systems.

Hospitals and Other Healthcare Facilities. Nephros filters are a leading tool used to provide proactive protection to patients in high-risk areas (e.g., ice machines, surgical rooms, NICUs) and reactive protection to patients in broader areas during periods of water pathogen outbreaks. Our products are used in hundreds of medical facilities to aid in infection control, both proactively and reactively.
 
As of 2019, according to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 6,100 hospitals in the U.S., with approximately 921,000 beds. In 2019, over 36 million patients were admitted to these hospitals. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) estimates that healthcare associated infections (“HAI”) occurr in approximately 1 out of every 31 hospital patients, which calculates to over 1 million patients in 2019. HAIs affect patients in hospitals or other healthcare facilities and are not present or incubating at the time of admission. They also include infections acquired by patients in the hospital or facility, but appearing after discharge, and occupational infections among staff. Many HAIs are caused by waterborne bacteria and viruses that can thrive in aging or complex plumbing systems often found in healthcare facilities.
 
In June 2017, the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) announced the addition of requirements for facilities to develop policies and procedures that inhibit the growth and spread of legionella and other opportunistic pathogens in building water systems. Going forward, CMS surveyors will review policies, procedures, and reports documenting water management implementation results to verify that facilities are compliant with these requirements. We believe that these CMS regulations may have a positive impact on the sale of our HAI-inhibiting ultrafilters.
 
We currently have FDA 510(k) clearance on the following portfolio of medical device products for use in the hospital setting to aid in infection control:
 

● | The DSU-H and SSU-H are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilters that provide dual- and single-stage protection, respectively, from waterborne pathogens. They are primarily used to filter potable water feeding ice machines, sinks, and medical equipment, such as endoscope washers and surgical room humidifiers. The DSU-H has an up to 6-month product life in a typical hospital setting, while the SSU-H has an up to 3-month life. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The S100 is a point-of-use, 0.01-micron microfilter that provides protection from waterborne pathogens. The S100 is primarily used to filter potable water feeding sinks and showers. The S100 has an up to 3-month product life when used in a hospital setting. 
● | The HydraGuardTM and HydraGuardTM - Flush are 0.005-micron cartridge ultrafilters that provide single-stage protection from waterborne pathogens. The HydraGuard ultrafilters are primarily used to filter potable water feeding ice machines and medical equipment, such as endoscope washers and surgical room humidifiers. The HydraGuard has an up to 6-month product life and the HydraGuard - Flush has an up to 12-month product life when used in a hospital setting. 

 
Our complete hospital infection control product line, including in-line, point-of-use, and cartridge filters, can be viewed on our website at http://www.nephros.com/infection-control/. We are not including the information on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Dialysis Centers - Water/Bicarbonate. In the dialysis water market, Nephros ultrafiltration products are among the highest performing products on the market. The DSU-D, SSU-D and the SSUmini have become the standard endotoxin filter in many portable reverse osmosis systems. The EndoPur®, our large-format ultrafilter targeted at dialysis clinic water systems, provides the smallest pore size available. Following a long pilot project at a major dialysis provider, we are now seeing growth in the use of this product. In addition, we aim to expand EndoPur’s usage into heat-disinfected water systems, which will further open the market for this product.
 
To perform hemodialysis, all dialysis clinics have dedicated water purification systems to produce water and bicarbonate concentrate, two essential ingredients for making dialysate, the liquid that removes waste material from the blood. According to the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, there are approximately 6,500 dialysis clinics in the United States servicing approximately 468,000 patients annually. We estimate that there are over 100,000 hemodialysis machines in operation in the United States.

Medicare is the main payer for dialysis treatment in the United States. To be eligible for Medicare reimbursement, dialysis centers must meet the minimum standards for water and bicarbonate concentrate quality set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (“AAMI”), the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and the International Standards Organization (“ISO”). We anticipate that the stricter standards approved by these organizations in 2009 will be adopted by Medicare in the near future.
 
We currently have FDA 510(k) clearance on the following portfolio of medical device products for use in the dialysis setting to aid in bacteria, virus, and endotoxin retention:
 

● | The DSU-D, SSU-D and SSUmini are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilters that provide protection from bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. All of these products have an up to 12-month product life in the dialysis setting and are used to filter water following treatment with a reverse osmosis (“RO”) system, and to filter bicarbonate concentrate. These ultrafilters are primarily used in the water lines and bicarbonate concentrate lines leading into dialysis machines, and as a polish filter for portable RO machines. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The EndoPur is a 0.005-micron cartridge ultrafilter that provides single-stage protection from bacteria, viruses, and endotoxins. The EndoPur has an up to 12-month product life in the dialysis setting and is used to filter water following treatment with an RO system. More specifically, the EndoPur is used primarily to filter water in large RO systems designed to provide ultrapure water to an entire dialysis clinic. The EndoPur is a cartridge-based, “plug and play” market entry that requires no plumbing at installation or replacement. The EndoPur is available in 10”, 20”, and 30” configurations. 

 
Commercial and Industrial Facilities. Our commercial NanoGuard® product line accomplishes ultrafiltration via small pore size (0.005 micron) technology, filtering bacteria and viruses from water. In addition, the AETHER brand expanded our product line to include water filtration and purification technologies that are primarily focused on improving odor and taste and on reducing scale and heavy metals from filtered water.
 
We purchased the AETHER brand to expedite our access to commercial markets and to expand our filtration expertise and capabilities. Our commercial market focus is on the hotel, restaurant, and convenience store markets. In the first-year post-acquisition, we upgraded Aether facilities to increase production and logistics capacity, integrated Aether products into the Nephros infection control product portfolio, and initiated sales efforts with several large commercial customers. We have recently added to our commercial sales team and, going forward, expect to close on one or more large contracts that may result in step-change increases in commercial market revenue.
 
Over time, we believe that the same water safety management programs currently underway at medical facilities may migrate to commercial markets. As the epidemiology of waterborne pathogens expands, links to contamination sources will become more efficient and the data more readily available. In cases where those sources are linked to restaurants, hotels, office buildings and residential complexes, the corporate owners of those facilities will likely face increasing liability exposure. We expect that building owners will come to understand ASHRAE-188, which outlines risk factors for buildings and their occupants, and provides water safety management guidelines. We believe, in time, most commercial buildings will need to follow the basic requirements of ASHRAE-188: create a water management plan, perform routine testing, and establish a plan to treat the building in the event of a positive test.
 
As demand for water testing and microbiological filtration grows, we will be ready to deploy our expertise and solutions based on years of experience servicing the medical market. We believe that we have an opportunity to offer unique expertise and products to the commercial market, and that our future revenue from the commercial market could even surpass our infection control revenue.
 
We currently market the following portfolio of proprietary products for use in the commercial, industrial, and food service settings:
 

● | The NanoGuard set of products are in-line, 0.005-micron ultrafilter that provides dual-stage retention of any organic or inorganic particle larger than 15,000 Daltons. NanoGuard products are designed to fit a variety of existing plumbing configurations, including 10” and 20” standard housings, and AETHER and Everpure® manifolds. Included in the NanoGuard product line are both conventional and flushable filters. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The AETHER line of commercial filters, which are also sold under the Nephros brand, provide a variety of technology solutions that improve water quality in food service, convenience store, hospitality, and industrial applications. AETHER filters improve water taste and odor, and reduce sediment, dirt, rust particles and other solids, chlorine and heavy minerals, lime scale build-up, and both particulate lead and soluble lead.

AETHER products combine effectively with NanoGuard ultrafiltration technologies to offer full-featured solutions to the commercial water market, including to existing users of Everpure filter manifolds.
 
Military and Outdoor Recreation. We developed our individual water treatment device (“IWTD”) in both in-line and point-of-use configurations. Our IWTD allows a soldier in the field to derive drinking water from any freshwater source. This enables the soldier to remain hydrated, to help maintain mission effectiveness and unit readiness, and to extend mission reach. Our IWTD has been validated by the military to meet the NSF Protocol P248 standard. It has also been approved by the U.S. Army Public Health Command and the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command for deployment.
 
In May 2015, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement (the “Sublicense Agreement”) with CamelBak Products, LLC (“CamelBak”). Under this Sublicense Agreement, we granted CamelBak an exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide (with the exception of Italy) sublicense and license, in each case solely to market, sell, distribute, import and export the IWTD. In exchange for the rights granted to CamelBak, CamelBak agreed, through December 31, 2022, to pay us a percentage of the gross profit on any sales made to a branch of the U.S. military, subject to certain exceptions, and to pay us a fixed per-unit fee for any other sales made. CamelBak was also required to meet or exceed certain minimum annual fees payable to us, and, if such fees are not met or exceeded, we were able to convert the exclusive sublicense to a non-exclusive sublicense with respect to non-U.S. military sales. In the first quarter of 2019, the Sublicense Agreement was amended to eliminate the minimum fee obligations starting May 6, 2018, and, as such, CamelBak has no further minimum fee obligations. Related to this Sublicense Agreement, approximately $5,000 of revenue was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no royalty revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Pathogen Detection Systems
 
Pathogen Detection in Infection Control. We recently expanded our portfolio of solutions with the introduction of our PluraPath™ pathogen detection system, which we believe represents a significant growth opportunity for Nephros.
 
We developed the PluraPath pathogen detection system to provide real-time data to infection control teams executing their water management plans. We integrated our ultrafilter technology with emerging, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology and real-time analytics. We chose a portable, open-source qPCR platform that allows us to parallel-processes up to 15 different bacteria and virus assays. We worked with industry experts to select and develop DNA- and RNA-based assays that could meet our goals of providing quantitative precision within one hour. We also developed a mobile application to extract and process the data real-time. Furthermore, we designed the system so that anyone can perform qPCR testing, not just someone with training in microbiological laboratory techniques.
 
With the PluraPath system, it will be possible to map and track the changes to levels of multiple bacterial and viral pathogens in a building’s water system on a real-time basis, at cost levels equivalent to assays that currently take 24-72 hours or more and typically provide data on only a single pathogen. Using PluraPath, we expect that infection control teams will be able to quickly assess approximate levels of a broad array of pathogens in their water systems, and optimally focus their secondary disinfection efforts and point-of-use filtration; services and products offered by our strategic partners.
 
The PluraPath system does not replace culture-based assays, which are the current regulatory requirements for confirmation in testing for waterborne pathogens. Rather, we believe PluraPath will become a valuable tool in the arsenal of defense, permitting faster decision making about a larger target population of pathogens. Our objective is to provide our customers and strategic partners with a user-friendly system that delivers dependable, actionable data to infection control teams in less than an hour.

Pathogen Detection in Dialysis Facilities. We have also been investigating pathogen detection efforts in the dialysis space. The LAL (limulus amebocyte lysate) test is a dialysis industry standard assay that identifies the presence of potential endotoxins, agnostic to the source species. The source of endotoxins are gram-negative bacteria. LAL testing routinely takes 48-72 hours to provide results from the time of shipping the sample to a central laboratory. When dialysis clinics have urgent contamination or severely elevated endotoxin issues, they may have to shut down for extended periods of time creating enormous logistical issues for patients and increasing the cost of care.
 
To provide a real-time solution for this testing paradigm, we announced the DialyPath™ pathogen detection and endotoxin estimation system in October 2020. The DialyPath system mirrors our PluraPath but includes a gram-negative DNA marker test and test for six different gram-negative bacteria. The DialyPath system is designed to provide data on two test samples in one run in less than one hour. The system will provide an estimate of the overall endotoxin in the sample, as well as estimated levels of six specific endotoxin-generating bacteria known to be frequent invaders of dialysis clinic water systems.
 
Facility-Wide Pathogen Detection. Bacterial contaminants in water systems can originate from thousands of different bacterial families. The technology now exists to map the water system biome in real-time, on-site, using an enhanced form of the portable PluraPath system and a bioinformatics database. The SequaPath system provides the capability to screen water for over 20,000 different bacterial genera (families), including genera of the 40+ pathogenic bacteria listed by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) in their “Opportunistic Pathogens of Premise Plumbing.” The system incorporates our proprietary filtration technology and a DNA sequencing step that makes it possible to screen rapidly for genera of waterborne pathogens. Like PluraPath, the SequaPath platform is portable, allowing for same-day on-site analysis.
 
The SequaPath technology was used in 2020 to perform an academic study that found far more bacteria in buildings unoccupied during the COVID-19 pandemic than in occupied buildings. The potential for building biome mapping is enormous. We are developing the technology, processes, and procedures to perform as many as 96 tests in a single run. SequaPath is currently available as a service offering.
 
While this service could be of value to the management of any water system in any building in any part of the world, we will first focus on the hospital customers of our strategic partners. Once proven in the hospital space, we believe that SequaPath has the potential to shift the building water testing paradigm across multiple markets and geographies.
 
Our Pathogen Detection Systems laboratories facility in Reno, Nevada, has matured into a first-class, environmental test development and manufacturing organization. The lab was recently enrolled in the CDC’s ELITE Program, which recognizes approximately 150 US laboratories capable of advanced isolation techniques with respect to Legionella identification. Our focus extends well beyond Legionella. Indeed, we believe our laboratories now offer the most extensive list of CDC-noted, opportunistic waterborne pathogens in a single test on the market today.
 
On July 9, 2021, we acquired 100% of GenArraytion, Inc. (“GenArraytion”). This acquisition gave us access to GenArraytion’s many proprietary assays, multiplexing technology, and selection methods for detecting waterborne pathogens and other microorganisms using Polymerase Chain Reaction technology. GenArraytion’s assets will be integrated into our Pathogen Detection Systems segment.
 
Additional Pathogen Detection Markets. Due primarily to the intellectual property acquired in the GenArraytion acquisition, including proprietary techniques of rapid assay development, we are exploring additional pathogen detection market opportunities, including additional waterborne pathogen detection markets as well as non-waterborne areas, such as mosquito- and tick-borne illness and women’s health panels.

Specialty Renal Products: HDF System
 
Introduction to HDF
 
The current standard of care in the United States for patients with chronic renal failure is hemodialysis (“HD”), a process in which toxins are cleared via diffusion. Patients typically receive HD treatments at least 3 times weekly for 3-4 hours per treatment. HD is most effective in removing smaller, easily diffusible toxins. For patients with acute renal failure, the current standard of care in the United States is hemofiltration (“HF”), a process where toxins are cleared via convection. HF offers a much better removal of larger sized toxins when compared to HD; however, HF treatment is more challenging for patients, as it is performed daily, and typically takes 12-24 hours per treatment.
 
Hemodiafiltration (“HDF”) is an alternative dialysis modality that combines the benefits of HD and HF into a single therapy by clearing toxins using both diffusion and convection. Though not widely used in the United States, HDF is prevalent in Europe and is performed for a growing number of patients. Clinical experience and literature show the following clinical and patient benefits of HDF:
 

● | Enhanced clearance of middle and large molecular weight toxins 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improved survival - up to a 35% reduction in mortality risk 
● | Reduction in the occurrence of dialysis-related amyloidosis 
● | Reduction in inflammation 
● | Reduction in medication such as EPO and phosphate binders 
● | Improved patient quality of life 
● | Reduction in number of hospitalizations and overall length of stay 

 
However, like HD, HDF can be resource-intensive and can require a significant amount of time to deliver one course of treatment.
 
Nephros HDF Background
 
Over the course of our history, we originally developed a medical device that enabled a standard HD machine to perform HDF. We refer to our approach as an on-line mid-dilution hemodiafiltration (“mid-dilution HDF”) system. Our original solution included an OLpūr H2H Hemodiafiltration Module (“H2H Module”), an OLpūr MD 220 Hemodiafilter (“HDF Filter”) and an H2H Substitution Filter (“Dialysate Filter”).
 
Our H2H Module attaches to a standard HD machine to perform on-line HDF therapy. The HD machine controls and monitors the basic treatment functions, as it would normally when providing HD therapy. The H2H Module is a free-standing, movable device that is placed next to either side of an HD machine. The H2H Module connects to the clinic’s water supply, drain, and electricity.
 
The H2H Module utilizes the HDF Filter and is very similar to a typical hollow fiber dialyzer assembled with a single hollow fiber bundle made with a high-flux (or high-permeability) membrane. The fiber bundle is separated into two discrete, but serially connected, blood paths. Dialysate flows in one direction that is counter-current to blood flow in Stage 1 and co-current to blood flow in Stage 2.
 
In addition to the HDF Filter, the H2H Module also utilizes a Dialysate Filter during patient treatment. The Dialysate Filter is a hollow fiber, ultrafilter device that consists of two sequential (redundant) ultrafiltration stages in a single housing. During on-line HDF with the H2H Module, fresh dialysate is redirected by the H2H Module’s hydraulic (substitution) pump and passed through this dual-stage ultrafilter before being infused as substitution fluid into the extracorporeal circuit. Providing ultrapure dialysate is crucial for the success of on-line HDF treatment.
 
Our original HDF system conformed with current ANSI/AAMI/ISO standards and was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure in 2012. To date, our HDF System is the only HDF system cleared by the FDA.
 
Over the last four years, DaVita Healthcare Partners, the Renal Research Institute (a research division of Fresenius Medical Care), and Vanderbilt University conducted post-market evaluations of our hemodiafiltration system in their clinics. We gathered direct feedback from these evaluations to develop a better understanding of how our system best fits into the current clinical and economic ESRD treatment paradigm. The ultimate goal of the evaluations was to better understand the potential for HDF in the U.S. clinical setting in order to (a) improve the quality of life for the patient, (b) reduce overall expenditure compared to other dialysis modalities, (c) minimize the impact on nurse workflow at the clinic, and (d) demonstrate the pharmacoeconomic benefit of the HDF technology to the U.S. healthcare system, as has been done in Europe with other HDF systems. The last evaluation was concluded at Vanderbilt in the first quarter of 2018.

Specialty Renal Products, Inc.
 
Over the past two years, we have dramatically simplified and redesigned our HDF device. Our updates have made the system significantly easier to use. By shifting from a reusable substitution ultrafilter to a disposable substitution ultrafilter, we were able to simplify the set-up process and substantially reduce the time required between patient treatments – two of the key complaints from users of our first-generation system. We used real-time user feedback to aid in the fine-tuning of our changes to the system that impacted usability. We believe our second-generation HDF system will meet the needs of both clinicians and patients.
 
In 2018, we spun-off the development of the HDF device into SRP. We raised $3 million of outside capital directly into SRP to fund the second-generation development described above. Nephros maintains a 62.5% ownership stake in SRP.
 
We submitted the second-generation HDF system for FDA clearance in June 2021. In October 2021, after an elongated review process, the FDA accepted SRP’s HDF Assist Device into its “substantive review” phase for 510(k) clearance. In late December 2021, FDA requested additional information from SRP about its submission. Specifically, the FDA requested additional support for the shelf-life and stability of SRP’s disposables; changes to its labels, documentation, and user screens; additional electrical testing; additional user testing; and additional HD machine-specific system performance testing. We expect to complete the work to address the FDA’s list in March or April of this year.
 
Once the HDF system is cleared by the FDA, we intend to launch it at 2-3 clinics having previous experience with our device. Thereafter, we plan to expand our efforts, on a measured basis, to clinics that wish to provide HDF therapy to their patients. We believe this measured launch approach is more likely to be successful than a broader push into the market. Nephrologists in the United States are not trained on HDF therapy; however, we believe many nephrologists are interested in exploring the option. We also believe that early adopters will want to perform studies to better understand the technology. We intend to support these investigator-initiated studies.
 
In anticipation of clearance, SRP has begun to manufacture supplies for its commercial launch, identify and hire key commercial launch staff, and select its initial commercial clinics. Prior to FDA approval, supplies manufactured in preparation for commercial launch are expensed. We anticipate that SRP will obtain 510(k) clearance in the first half of 2022 and will be in position to launch in the second half of the year.
 
While a number of studies have been performed in Europe, the body of evidence for optimal use of HDF needs to be built in the U.S. treatment setting. According to European data from Fresenius, over 15% of dialysis treatments are HDF. That could translate to over 10 million individual treatments if HDF achieved that level of penetration in the United States. We do not believe that the United States will instantaneously mirror Europe. However, we do believe that HDF therapy has a place in the treatment landscape for patients with ESRD in the United States, and we look forward to enabling this pathway.

Competition
 
With respect to the water filtration market, we compete with companies that are well-entrenched in the water filtration domain. These companies include Pall Corporation (now wholly owned by Danaher Corporation), which manufactures point-of-use microfiltration products, as well as 3M and Pentair, who manufacture the Cuno® and Everpure® brands of water filtration and purification products respectively. Our methods of competition in the water filtration domain include:

● | developing and marketing products that are designed to meet critical and specific customer needs more effectively than competitive devices; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | offering unique attributes that illustrate our product reliability, “user-friendliness,” and performance capabilities; 
● | selling products to specific customer groups where our unique product attributes are mission-critical; and 
● | pursuing alliance and/or acquisition opportunities for joint product development and distribution. 

 
The PluraPath pathogen detection system will compete in the $8 billion global water testing market. Portable, real-time water testing, however, is a relatively new market, with few competitors, including Spartan Bioscience.
 
The dialyzer and renal replacement therapy market is subject to intense competition. Accordingly, our future success will depend on our ability to meet the clinical goals of nephrologists, improve patient outcomes, and remain cost-effective for payers.
 
We also compete with other suppliers of ESRD therapies, supplies and services. These suppliers include Fresenius Medical Care AG and Baxter International, Inc., currently two of the primary machine manufacturers in hemodialysis. Fresenius Medical Care AG and Baxter International, Inc. also manufacture HDF machines that are not currently approved in the United States.
 
The markets in which we sell our dialysis products are highly competitive. Our competitors in the sale of hemodialysis products include Baxter International Inc., Fresenius Medical Care AG, Asahi Kasei Medical Co. Ltd., B. Braun Melsungen AG, Nipro Medical Corporation Ltd., Nikkiso Co., Ltd., Terumo Medical Corporation and Toray Medical Co., Ltd.
 
Other competitive considerations include pharmacological and technological advances in preventing the progression of ESRD in high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes and hypertension, technological developments by others in the area of dialysis, the development of new medications designed to reduce the incidence of kidney transplant rejection, and progress in using kidneys harvested from genetically engineered animals as a source of transplants.

We are not aware of any other companies using technology similar to ours in the treatment of ESRD. Our competition would increase, however, if companies that currently sell ESRD products, or new companies that enter the market, develop technology that is more efficient than ours. We believe that in order to become competitive in this market, we will need to develop and maintain competitive products and take and hold sufficient market share from our competitors. Therefore, we expect our methods of competing in the ESRD marketplace to include:
 

● | continuing our efforts to develop, manufacture, and sell products that, when compared to competitive products, perform more efficiently, and are available at prices that are acceptable to the market; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | displaying our products and providing associated literature at major industry trade shows in the United States; 
● | initiating discussions with dialysis clinic medical directors, as well as representatives of dialysis clinical chains, to develop interest in our products; 
● | pursuing alliance opportunities in certain territories for distribution of our products and possible alternative manufacturing facilities; and 
● | entering into license agreements similar to our License Agreement with Bellco to expand market share. 

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We protect our technology and products through patents and patent applications. In addition to the United States, we also apply for patents in other jurisdictions, such as the European Patent Office, Canada, and Japan, to the extent we deem appropriate. We have built a portfolio of patents and applications covering our products, including their hardware design and methods of hemodiafiltration.
 
We believe that our patent strategy will provide a competitive advantage in our target markets, but our patents may not be broad enough to cover our competitors’ products and may be subject to invalidation claims. Our U.S. patents for the “Method and Apparatus for Efficient Hemodiafiltration” and for the “Dual-Stage Filtration Cartridge” have claims that cover the OLpūr MDHDF filter series and the method of hemodiafiltration employed in the operation of the products. Technological developments in ESRD therapy could reduce the value of our intellectual property. Any such reduction could be rapid and unanticipated. We have issued patents on our water filtration products and applications in process to cover various applications in residential, commercial, and remote environments.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had five U.S. patents, one Chinese patent, one French patent, one German patent, one Italian patent, one United Kingdom patent, and one Canadian patent. In addition, we had two pending patent applications in the United States. Our pending patent applications relate to a range of filter technologies, including liquid purification filter systems and portable systems for detecting waterborne pathogens by rapid filtration, concentration, and detection of the waterborne pathogens.
 
Trademarks
 
As of December 31, 2021, in the United States, we secured registrations of the trademarks HYDRAGUARD, NANOGUARD, ENDOPUR, FILPATH, PLURAPATH, DIALYPATH MULTIFLEX, MULTIFLEX BIOASSAY, GenArraytion and SEQUAPATH. In Canada, we filed trademark applications for PLURAPATH and SEQUAPATH. In Europe and the UK, we secured registrations for the trademark MULTIFLEX.
Governmental Regulation
 
The research and development, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of our ESRD therapy products in the United States, Europe and other regions of the world are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including the FDA, the European Union and analogous agencies.

United States
 
The FDA regulates the manufacture and distribution of medical devices in the United States pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics (FDC) Act. All of our ESRD therapy products are regulated in the United States as medical devices by the FDA under the FDC Act. Under the FDC Act, medical devices are classified in one of three classes, namely Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.

● | Class I devices are medical devices for which general controls are deemed sufficient to ensure their safety and effectiveness. General controls include provisions related to (1) labeling, (2) producer registration, (3) defect notification, (4) records and reports and (5) quality service requirements (“QSR”). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class II devices are medical devices for which the general controls for the Class I devices are deemed not sufficient to ensure their safety and effectiveness and require special controls in addition to the general controls. Special controls include provisions related to (1) performance and design standards, (2) post-market surveillance, (3) patient registries and (4) the use of FDA guidelines. 
● | Class III devices are the most regulated medical devices and are generally limited to devices that support or sustain human life or are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Pre-market approval by the FDA is the required process of scientific review to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. 

 
Before a new medical device can be introduced to the market, Section 510(k), and Section 515 of the FDC Act require a manufacturer who intends to market a medical device to submit a premarket notification (Section 510(k)) or a request for premarket approval (Section 515), to the FDA.
 
A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed Class I or Class II medical device or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not called for premarket approval under Section 515. The 510(k) clearance process is generally faster and simpler than the premarket approval process.
 
Premarket approval (PMA) is the FDA’s process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or are new and present unknown safety or effectiveness issues or risks. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. To gain approval, the manufacturer must present adequate scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
 
For any devices cleared through the 510(k) clearance process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new 510(k) clearance submission. Accordingly, if we do obtain Section 510(k) clearance for any of our ESRD therapy and/or filtration products, we will need to submit another Section 510(k) notification if we significantly affect that product’s safety or effectiveness through subsequent modifications or enhancements.
 
All of our products have been cleared by the FDA as Class II devices, such as:
 

● | DSU Dual Stage UltraFilter: In June 2009, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the DSU to be used to filter biological contaminants from water and bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis procedures. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SSU-D/DSU-D Dual Stage UltraFilter: In July 2011, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the SSU/DSU to be used to filter water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis procedures. 
● | OLpūr H2H Module and OLpūr MD 220 Hemodiafilter: In April 2012, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the OLpūr H2H Module and OLpūr MD 220 Hemodiafilter for use with a UF controlled hemodialysis machine that provides ultrapure dialysate in accordance with current ANSI/AAMI/ISO standards, for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure in the United States.

● | DSU-H/SSU-H: In October 2014, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the DSU-H and SSU-H ultrafilters to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filters retain bacteria, viruses, and endotoxin. By providing ultrapure water for patient washing and drinking, the filters aid in infection control. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | S100 Point of Use Filter: In April 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the S100 point-of-use filter to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filters retain bacteria. By retaining bacteria in water for washing and drinking, the filter may aid in infection control. 
● | HydraGuard: In December 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the HydraGuard 10” ultrafilter intended to be used to filter EPA quality drinking water. The filter retains bacteria, viruses and endotoxin. By providing ultrapure water for patient washing and drinking, the filter aids in infection control. 
● | EndoPur: In March 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of the EndoPur ultrafilter intended to be used to filter water used in hemodialysis devices. It assists in providing hemodialysis quality water. The device is not a complete water treatment system but serves to remove biological contaminants. Therefore, it must be used in conjunction with other water treatment equipment (Reverse Osmosis, Deionization, etc.). 

 
The FDC Act requires that medical devices be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s current QSR regulations which require, among other things, that:
 

● | the design and manufacturing processes be regulated and controlled by the use of written procedures; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the ability to produce medical devices which meet the manufacturer’s specifications be validated by extensive and detailed testing of every aspect of the process; 
● | any deficiencies in the manufacturing process or in the products produced be investigated; 
● | detailed records be kept, and a corrective and preventative action plan be in place; and 
● | manufacturing facilities be subject to FDA inspection on a periodic basis to monitor compliance with QSR regulations. 

 
In addition to the requirements described above, the FDC Act requires that:
 

● | all medical device manufacturers and distributors register with the FDA annually and provide the FDA with a list of those medical devices which they distribute commercially; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | information be provided to the FDA on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of the products, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and 
● | certain medical devices not cleared with the FDA for marketing in the United States meet specific requirements before they are exported. 

 
We and our contract manufacturers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers, or regulated suppliers, are not in compliance with these requirements, there may be a material adverse effect on our manufacturing operations, effecting our ability to sell.
 
European Union
 
The European Union began to harmonize national regulations comprehensively for the control of medical devices in member nations in 1993, when it adopted its Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. The European Union directive applies to both the manufacturer’s quality assurance system and the product’s technical design and discusses the various ways to obtain approval of a device (dependent on device classification), how to properly CE mark a device, and how to place a device on the market.

In 2017, the European Union (EU) adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period to May 2020 and will replace the existing directives on medical devices in the EU. After May 2020, medical devices marketed in the EU require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directive before May 2020, may be placed on the market until 2024. Complying with this new regulation will require us to incur significant costs and failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the European Union and other countries that utilize or rely on European Union requirements for medical device registrations.
 
As defined in Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC, the regulatory approach necessary to demonstrate to the European Union that the organization has the ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer requirements and regulatory requirements applicable to medical devices requires the certification of a full quality management system by a notified body. Initially, we engaged TÜV Rheinland of North America, Inc. (“TÜV Rheinland”) as the notified body to assist us in obtaining certification to ISO 13485/2003 standard, which demonstrates the presence of a quality management system that can be used by an organization for design and development, production, installation and servicing of medical devices and the design, development and provision of related services.
 
European Union requirements for products are set forth in harmonized European Union standards and include conformity to safety requirements, physical and biological properties, construction and environmental properties, and information supplied by the manufacturer. A company demonstrates conformity to these requirements, with respect to a product, by pre-clinical tests, biocompatibility tests, qualification of products and packaging, risk analysis and well-conducted clinical investigations approved by ethics committees.
 
Once a manufacturer’s full quality management system is determined to be in compliance with ISO 13485/2003 and other statutory requirements, and the manufacturer’s products conform to harmonized European standards, the notified body will recommend and document such conformity. The manufacturer will receive a CE marking and ISO certifications, and then may place a CE mark on the relevant products. The CE mark, which stands for Conformité Européene, demonstrates compliance with the relevant European Union requirements. Products subject to these provisions that do not bear the CE mark cannot be imported to, or sold or distributed within, the European Union.
 
Medical Devices sold in Europe/ anticipated to be sold in Europe, shall be examined, and classified as:
 

● | Class I: Provided non-sterile or do not have a measuring functions; Low Risk 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class I: Provided sterile and/or have a measuring function; Low/medium risk 
● | Class IIa: Medium risk 
● | Class IIb: Medium/high risk 
● | Class III: High risk 

 
In July 2003, we received a certification from TÜV Rheinland that our quality management system conforms to the requirements of the European Community. At the same time, TÜV Rheinland approved our use of the CE marking with respect to the design and production of high permeability hemodialyzer products for ESRD therapy. In April 2010, we changed our notified body from TÜV Rheinland to BSI America, Inc. and expanded our scope to include design and development and production of water filters.
 
Under the License Agreement with Bellco, as discussed above, we granted Bellco a license to manufacture, market and sell the covered products under its own name, label and CE mark in the stated territory. In addition, if requested by us, Bellco will be required to sell the covered products to our distributors in the stated territory.

The following products have been certified by BSI America for CE marking and adherence to ISO13485 standards as Class IIa (Rule 3) medical devices:
 

● | SSU-D/DSU-D Dual Stage Ultrafilter: Intended to be used to filter water or bicarbonate concentrate used in hemodialysis procedures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Authorities in Regions Outside of the United States and the European Union
 
In November 2007 and May 2011, the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada, the Canadian health regulatory agency, approved our OLpūr MD220 Hemodiafilter and our DSU, respectively, for marketing in Canada. Other than the Canadian approval of our OLpūr MD220 Hemodiafilter and DSU products, we have not obtained any regulatory approvals to sell any of our products outside of the United States and the European Union and there is no assurance that any such clearance or certification will be issued.
 
Requirements pertaining to medical devices vary widely from country to country, ranging from no health regulations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to audits and have been certified to be ISO 13485:2016 and Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which allows us to sell our products in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
 
Currently we are in the process to seek approval for MDSAP compliance. The Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) is a program that allows the conduct of a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer’s quality management system that satisfies the requirements of multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Audits are conducted by Auditing Organizations authorized by the participating Regulatory Authorities to audit under MDSAP requirements. The MDSAP is a way that medical device manufacturers can be audited once for compliance with the standard and regulatory requirements of up to five different medical device markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the United States.
 
Following the completion of MDSAP, this certification will allow us to sell our products in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other territories around the world, while maintaining our current approvals. The time and cost of obtaining new, and maintaining existing, market authorizations from countries outside of North America, and the requirements for licensing products in these countries may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
 
Reimbursement
 
In both domestic markets and markets outside of the United States, sales of our ESRD therapy products will depend in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. In the United States, ESRD providers are reimbursed through Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers. In countries other than the United States, ESRD providers are also reimbursed through governmental insurers. In countries other than the United States, the pricing and profitability of our products generally will be subject to government controls. Despite the continually expanding influence of the European Union, national healthcare systems in its member nations, including reimbursement decision-making, are neither regulated nor integrated at the European Union level. Each country has its own system, often closely protected by its corresponding national government.
Product Liability and Insurance
 
The production, marketing and sale of our products have an inherent risk of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation. We have acquired product liability insurance for our products in the amount of $2 million. A successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could materially deplete our assets. Moreover, any claim against us could generate negative publicity, which could decrease the demand for our products, our ability to generate revenues and our profitability.
 
Some of our existing and potential agreements with manufacturers of our products and components of our products do or may require us (1) to obtain product liability insurance or (2) to indemnify manufacturers against liabilities resulting from the sale of our products. If we are not able to maintain adequate product liability insurance, we will be in breach of these agreements, which could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our products. Even if we are able to obtain and maintain product liability insurance, if a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage is made, then we may have to indemnify some or all of our manufacturers for their losses, which could materially deplete our assets.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of 34 full-time employees, including 9 employed in sales/marketing/customer support, 14 in general and administrative, and 11 in research and development. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. During 2021, we had limited voluntary turnover and focused on maintaining our workforce throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Going forward, we intend to focus on maintaining our current good relations with our employees and continuing to develop and explore ways to collaborate with our employees and create a well-regarded workplace.
Available Information
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Exchange Act requires us to file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. These materials may be obtained electronically by accessing the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
