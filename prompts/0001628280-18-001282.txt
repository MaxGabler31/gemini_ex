ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business — An Overview
NeuroMetrix is a commercial stage, innovation driven healthcare company combining bioelectrical and digital medicine to address chronic health conditions including chronic pain, sleep disorders, and diabetes. Our business is fully integrated with in-house capabilities spanning product development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, and customer support. We derive revenues from the sale of medical devices and after-market consumable products and accessories. Our products are sold in the United States and selected overseas markets, and are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and regulators in foreign jurisdictions where appropriate. We have two principal product lines:

• | Wearable neuro-stimulation therapeutic devices


• | Point-of-care neuropathy diagnostic tests

Our core expertise in biomedical engineering has been refined over nearly two decades of designing, building and marketing medical devices that stimulate nerves and analyze nerve response for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We created the market for point-of-care nerve testing and were first to market with sophisticated, wearable technology for management of chronic pain. We also have an experienced management team and Board of Directors. Chronic pain is a significant public health problem. It is defined by the National Institutes of Health as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks in contrast to acute pain which is a normal bodily response to injury or trauma. Chronic pain conditions include painful diabetic neuropathy, or PDN, arthritis, fibromyalgia, sciatica, musculoskeletal pain, cancer pain and many others. Chronic pain may be triggered by an injury or there may be an ongoing cause such as disease or illness. There may also be no clear cause. Pain signals continue to be transmitted in the nervous system over extended periods of time often leading to other health problems. 
1

These can include fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and mood changes which cause difficulty in carrying out important activities and contributing to disability and despair. In general, chronic pain cannot be cured. Treatment of chronic pain is focused on reducing pain and improving function. The goal is effective pain management.
Chronic pain is widespread. It affects over 100 million adults in the United States and more than 1.5 billion people worldwide. The global market for pain management drugs and devices alone was valued at $35 billion in 2012. The estimated incremental impact of chronic pain on health care costs in the United States is over $250 billion per year and lost productivity is estimated to exceed $300 billion per year. Estimated out-of-pocket spending in the United States on chronic pain is $20 billion per year.
The most common approach to chronic pain is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter drugs (such as Advil and Motrin), and prescription drugs including anti-convulsants (such as Lyrica and Neurontin) and anti-depressants (such as Cymbalta and Elavil). Topical creams may also be used (such as Zostrix and Bengay). With severe pain, narcotic pain medications may be prescribed (such as codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone). The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often hit or miss. Side effects and the potential for addiction are real and the risks are substantial.
Reflecting the difficulty in treating chronic pain, we believe that inadequate relief leads 25% to 50% of pain sufferers to turn to the over-the-counter market for supplements or alternatives to prescription pain medications. These include non-prescription medications, topical creams, lotions, electrical stimulators, dietary products, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total they account for over $4 billion in annual spending in the United States on pain relief products.
High frequency nerve stimulation is an established treatment for chronic pain supported by numerous clinical studies demonstrating efficacy. In simplified outline, the mechanism of action involves intensive nerve stimulation to activate the body’s central pain inhibition system resulting in widespread analgesia, or pain relief. The nerve stimulation activates brainstem pain centers leading to the release of endogenous opioids that act primarily through the delta opioid receptor to reduce pain signal transmission through the central nervous system. This therapeutic approach is available through deep brain stimulation and through implantable spinal cord stimulation, both of which require surgery and have attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches to neuro-stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to device limitations, ineffective dosing and low patient compliance.
Collaboration with GSK Consumer Healthcare
On January 12, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Novartis Consumer Health S.A., an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, pursuant to which we agreed to sell to GSK our Quell technology for markets outside of the United States, including certain patents and related assets. The purchase price for the assets being sold pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement is equal to $5 million. NeuroMetrix retains exclusive ownership of Quell technology in the U.S. market. NeuroMetrix and GSK also entered into a Development and Services Agreement on January 12, 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to provide services related to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the Quell technology for markets outside of the U.S. Pursuant to the Development and Services Agreement, GSK has agreed to make contingent payments of up to $21.5 million to NeuroMetrix upon the occurrence of certain development and commercialization milestones. In addition, GSK and NeuroMetrix will co-fund development of next-generation Quell technology during an initial period of 2018 through 2020, with subsequent annual renewals by mutual agreement. NeuroMetrix agreed not to compete with GSK with respect to the development and commercialization of the Quell technology and device outside of the U.S. until the tenth anniversary of the date of termination or expiration without renewal of the Development and Services Agreement. 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement, NeuroMetrix entered into a Contribution Agreement on December 22, 2017 with Quell Intellectual Property Corp., LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company that was formed as a special purpose entity, and contributed certain intellectual property rights related to the Quell technology. Following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement, NeuroMetrix and GSK each now own a 50% interest in Quell Intellectual Property Corp, LLC. Quell Intellectual Property Corp., LLC entered into two exclusive license agreements with NeuroMetrix relating to rights to Quell intellectual property for use in the U.S. and in markets outside the U.S. Under the terms of an Assignment Agreement entered into on January 12, 2018, NeuroMetrix assigned the ex-U.S. license agreement to GSK. We refer herein to these agreements as the GSK Collaboration.
Our Strategy
2

There are large and important unmet medical needs in chronic pain treatment. Prescription pain medications and over-the-counter therapies are often inadequate and can lead to other health issues. We believe that controlled, personalized, neuro-stimulation to suppress pain provides an important complement to pain medications. As a medical device company with unique experience in designing devices to manage and alter peripheral nerve function, we believe we are well positioned to make neuro-stimulation widely available to chronic pain sufferers. We have direct experience with neuro-stimulation through our prescription SENSUS wearable pain management device which has been on the market for the past four and half years and Quell, our over-the-counter, or OTC, wearable device for pain relief which was launched in the second quarter of 2015 and builds upon the core SENSUS neuro-stimulation technology.
Our primary objective is revenue growth with margin expansion and declining cash consumption. We expect this to be led by the successful market adoption of Quell. We also expect an important contribution to revenue from DPNCheck, our rapid, accurate diagnostic test for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Our key business strategies include:
Driving Commercial Adoption of Key Proprietary Products.

• | Quell, our OTC wearable device for pain relief, was made commercially available in the United States during the second quarter of 2015. Following commercial launch through the end of 2017, approximately 140,500 Quell devices plus electrodes and accessories were shipped to customers. Quell revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $12.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Quell utilizes OptiTherapy, our proprietary non-invasive neuro-stimulation technology to provide relief from chronic intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes, fibromyalgia, arthritic pain, and lower back and leg pain. This advanced wearable device is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active, and at night while sleeping. It has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of chronic pain without a doctor’s prescription. Users of the device have the option of using their smartphones to control pain therapy and to track sleep, activity, gait and therapy parameters. Quell is distributed in the United States via e-commerce, via direct response television, and via select retail merchandisers, and health care professionals. Distribution is supported by television promotion and digital advertising to expand product awareness.


• | DPNCheck, our diagnostic test for peripheral neuropathies, was made commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2011. DPNCheck revenues for the years December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $3.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Our US sales efforts focus on Medicare Advantage providers who assume financial responsibility and the associated risks for the health care costs of their patients. We believe that DPNCheck presents an attractive clinical case with early detection of neuropathy allowing for earlier clinical intervention to help mitigate the effects of neuropathy on both patient quality of life and cost of care. Also, the diagnosis and documentation of neuropathy provided by DPNCheck helps clarify the patient health profile which, in turn, may have a direct, positive effect on the Medicare Advantage premium received by the provider. We believe that attractive opportunities exist outside the United States including Japan where DPNCheck is marketed by our distribution partner Fukuda Denshi; in China where we initiated sales in 2017 via Omron Beijing Ltd.; and in Mexico where DPNCheck is marketed by Scienta Farma.

Research and Development Innovation for Competitive Advantage  Our research and development, or R&D, team developed Quell, an FDA cleared, technologically sophisticated, smart phone integrated product with electrodes and other accessories. We believe that there are no comparable products on the market. Our R&D team is now responsible for maintaining and expanding Quell’s competitive technological advantage, addressing opportunities to reduce Quell cost of goods sold, and enhancing our intellectual property position, through continuing innovation. We expect innovation to take the form of device and software enhancements to improve the user experience, expanded smart phone applications, and new electrode features to optimize therapy. Technological innovation will continue to be one of our top priorities.
Our Business Model
Our products consist of a medical device used in conjunction with a consumable electrode or biosensor. Other accessories and consumables are also available to customers. Our commercial objective is to build an installed base of active, satisfied customer accounts and distributors that regularly order aftermarket products to meet their needs. We successfully implemented this model when we started our business with the NC-stat system and applied it to subsequent product generations including the ADVANCE system. Our more recently developed products, Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck, conform to this model.
Primary Marketed Products
Quell
3

Quell is a wearable device for relief of chronic intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes and lower back problems. It incorporates our OptiTherapy technology, a collection of proprietary approaches designed to optimize the clinical efficacy of nerve stimulation. These include high power electrical stimulation hardware with precise control, algorithms that automatically determine therapeutic stimulation intensity and compensate for nerve desensitization, and automated detection of user sleep and appropriate adjustment of stimulation level. Quell is comprised of (1) an electronic device carried in a neoprene band that is worn on the upper calf and (2) an electrode that attaches to the device and is the interface between the device and the skin. The device is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active, and at night while sleeping. It has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of chronic intractable pain and is available OTC. Users of the device have the option of using their smartphones to control pain therapy and to track sleep and therapy parameters. The device was made commercially available in June 2015. In an independent post-market clinical study of Quell initiated by NeuroMetrix, 81% of subjects reported an improvement in their chronic pain and health, and 67% reported a reduction in their use of pain medications. To encourage persons with chronic pain to try Quell, we offer a 60-day trial period during which the product can be returned for a full refund. To date, product returns have averaged approximately 25%. We estimate, over time, we will see product returns in the range of 20% to 25%, as indicated by the results of the post-market clinical study. The addressable market opportunity for Quell in the United States is estimated to be 19 million chronic pain sufferers. Quell is available via e-commerce, via direct response television, via select retail merchandisers, and via health care professionals. Distribution is supported by television promotion and digital advertising to expand product awareness. Following commercial launch through 2017 approximately 140,500 devices plus consumables and accessories were shipped to customers.
DPNCheck
DPNCheck is a fast, accurate, and quantitative nerve conduction test that is used to evaluate systemic neuropathies such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN. It is designed to be used by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, podiatrists and other clinicians at the point-of-care to objectively detect, stage, and monitor DPN. The device measures nerve conduction velocity and response amplitude of the sural nerve, a nerve in the lower leg and ankle. These parameters are widely recognized as sensitive and specific biomarkers of DPN. DPNCheck is comprised of: (1) an electronic hand-held device and (2) a single patient use biosensor. In addition, we provide users with PC-based software that links to the device via a USB connection. This PC software allows physicians to generate reports and manage their sural nerve conduction data.
DPNCheck is a modified version of our previously marketed NC-stat nerve testing device that has the same clinical indications with respect to DPN. The modified device costs less than the original device, but has the same functionality with respect to sural nerve testing. More than 2.7 million patient studies have been performed using our NC-stat technology and there have been approximately 7.3 million nerve tests. It has been the subject of many published studies, including several studies specifically addressing the accuracy and clinical utility of the device in assessment of DPN. DPNCheck shipments commenced in late 2011 and approximately 4,000 devices plus consumables have been placed with customers through December 31, 2017.
ADVANCE System
Our legacy neurodiagnostics business is the ADVANCE System, which is a comprehensive platform for the performance of traditional nerve conduction studies. The ADVANCE System is comprised of: (1) the ADVANCE device and related modules, (2) various types of electrodes, and (3) a communication hub that enables the physician’s office to network their device to their personal computers and our servers for data archiving, report generation, and other network services. The ADVANCE System is most commonly used with proprietary nerve specific electrode arrays. These electrode arrays combine multiple individual electrodes and embedded microelectronic components into a single patient-use disposable unit. We currently market seven different nerve specific electrode arrays but do not actively market the ADVANCE device.
Historically, the ADVANCE System was marketed to a broad range of physician specialties including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, primary care physicians, and endocrinologists, and utilized for a variety of different clinical indications including assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome, or CTS, low back and leg pain, and DPN. It is most commonly used in the assessment of CTS. Numerous papers have been published on the use of this technology in this clinical application. More than 2.7 million patient studies have been performed using our NC stat technology and there have been approximately 7.3 million nerve tests, including 1.6 million sural nerve tests. As of December 31, 2017, we had an installed base of approximately 300 active customers using our ADVANCE System.
The following chart summarizes our previously marketed products and currently marketed products.

Quell sales and marketing efforts are led by our Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Sales and marketing efforts for DPNCheck and ADVANCE are led by our Senior Vice President, General Manager, Diagnostics.
We provide technical, clinical, and business practices training for our commercial employees including sales and marketing, and customer service.
Manufacturing and Supply
We perform final assembly and servicing of our Quell and DPNCheck devices at our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. The ADVANCE device which is no longer in production but for which we continue to sell accessories, is serviced by us. Outside suppliers provide us the sub-assemblies and components that we use in manufacturing Quell and DPNCheck, as well as our consumable biosensors/electrodes. We maintain alternative suppliers for some but not all of the sub-assemblies and key components. Consumable biosensors/electrodes are manufactured to our specifications by two long standing suppliers. In outsourcing, we target companies that meet FDA, International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and other quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Supplier performance is maintained and managed through a corrective action program ensuring all product requirements are met or exceeded. Following the receipt of products or product components from our third-party manufacturers, we conduct the necessary inspection, final assembly, packaging, and labeling at our manufacturing facility. We believe that our manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment, provide us with manufacturing expertise, and help control costs.
Sunburst EMS, Inc. has been manufacturing devices and providing sub-assemblies to us since 2005. Sunburst currently manufactures sub-assemblies for Quell and DPNCheck at a facility in Massachusetts.
MC Assembly, Inc., a contract manufacturer, has manufactured sub-assemblies for Quell, at a facility in Massachusetts since 2016.
Johnson Medtech, LLC, or Johnson, has been manufacturing ADVANCE electrodes for us since 1999, currently at a facility in Massachusetts. Johnson is planning to shift production in the first quarter of 2018 to another Johnson facility located in Ohio.
Katecho, Inc., a full service original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, specializing in medical and cosmetic devices, manufactures biosensors for use with our DPNCheck device and electrodes for use with our Quell devices under normal commercial terms contained in our purchase orders. Katecho manufactures electrodes at its facility in Iowa.
We and our third-party manufacturers are registered with the FDA and subject to compliance with FDA quality system regulations. We are also ISO registered and undergo frequent quality system audits by a European agency. Our ADVANCE System and DPNCheck are cleared for marketing within the United States, Canada, and the European Union. DPNCheck is also cleared for marketing in Japan, China and Mexico. Our neuro-stimulation systems for chronic pain, Quell and SENSUS, are cleared for marketing in the United States, Canada, the European Economic Area, and Australia. Our facility is subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities, and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state agencies. As a registered device manufacturer, we will undergo regularly scheduled FDA quality system inspections. However, additional FDA inspections may occur if deemed necessary by the FDA.
Research and Development
We believe that we have research and development (R&D) capability that is unique to the industry with over two decades of experience in developing diagnostic and therapeutic devices involving the stimulation and measurement of nerve signals for clinical purposes. This group has extensive experience in neurophysiology, biomedical instrumentation, signal processing, biomedical sensors, and information systems.
Our R&D team works closely with our marketing group and customers to design products that are focused on improving clinical outcomes. The team consists of ten people including two who hold M.D. degrees and three who hold Ph.D. degrees. It includes the extensive involvement of our founder and Chief Executive Officer who holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees and who also coordinates the clinical programs that are supported by NeuroMetrix.
R&D efforts currently encompass the following areas:

• | Quell Innovation. Quell utilizes our proprietary wearable intensive nerve stimulation (WINS) technology to provide relief from chronic pain which can encompass lower back problems, fibromyalgia, arthritis, painful diabetic neuropathy 

6

and others. Quell is unique among OTC neuro-stimulation products in its clinical indications, technology, personalization and digital health features. Our R&D efforts to date have provided us first-to-market competitive advantage. We anticipate that success will attract competition and that we must continually innovate to maintain a leadership position. Our product development strategy is focused on the annual delivery of new features that enhance usability and biometric tracking. These include form factor changes, electrode improvements and expanding digital health integration. We intend to strengthen our intellectual property position with the development of additional know-how and a growing body of patent applications.

• | Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Improvement. We have identified specific opportunities to reduce Quell COGS, with both near-term and longer-term initiatives underway. Lower COGS would improve gross margins, thereby providing pricing flexibility, which may be necessary to expand Quell adoption. These COGS initiatives involve R&D support as well as investment in engineering design and equipment. 


• | Support for DPNCheck. DPNCheck is our quantitative nerve conduction test for peripheral neuropathies including DPN. Its usage is growing in the Medicare Advantage market in the United States, in Japan and in Mexico. DPNCheck received regulatory approval in China and Omron Beijing, Ltd has initiated commercial activities in that market. The characteristics of new markets often require device modification for local acceptance which, in turn, involves our R&D team. 


• | Support clinical studies for our wearable technology. Quell is an FDA-cleared Class 2 medical device. We expect that an expanding body of evidence from clinical studies will continue to build Quell credibility among health care professionals and support our marketing efforts. As an example, in 2015 we completed an independent post-market clinical study for Quell. Results were positive with 81% of subjects reporting an improvement in their chronic pain and overall health, and 67% reporting a reduction in their use of pain medications while using Quell. This was directly relevant to Quell marketing and reinforced the need to continue to build the clinical foundation for Quell. We have underway several small-scale clinical studies to assess efficacy in key pain indications, reduction in prescription opioid use in cancer patients, back pain, and improvements in sleep, among others. 

Research and development expenses were approximately $3.5 million and $4.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Clinical Program
Our clinical program operates under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer. This may from time-to-time be comprised of internal, collaborative, and external clinical studies. Internal clinical studies are designed and implemented directly by us for the purposes of product design and early clinical validation. Collaborative studies are conducted together with leading researchers around the world to provide clinical validation and to explore the clinical utility of our products. External studies are entirely independent of us, although in many cases the researchers request unrestricted grants for financial and/or material support, such as for devices and consumables. External studies may examine the clinical performance and utility of our products or our products may be used as outcomes measures. We actively seek to publish our clinical study results in leading peer-reviewed journals while also encouraging our clinical collaborators and clinical study grant recipients to do the same.
In a study published last year in the Journal of Pain Research, 81% of subjects reported a general improvement in their chronic pain and 67% reported a reduction in pain medication use after 60 days of use of Quell. Additional study findings included decreased pain interference with sleep and walking ability. Four external studies have been carried out in 2017.

• | Quell TENS band for Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN), A Feasibility Study (University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). This open label study is designed to evaluate Quell efficacy, assessed by pain relief and continued device use, in subjects with CIPN. Preliminary results were presented at the American Pain Society meeting May 17-20, 2017, in Pittsburgh, PA. Among subjects completing the first 6 weeks of the study, 73% decided to continue using their Quell device. In addition, statistically significant reductions in pain, tingling, cramping and numbness were observed. A large-scale randomized sham-controlled study is planned in 2018 by the principal investigator at the University of Rochester.


• | Quell Opioid Reduction and Pain Relief in Patients with Cancer (Scripps Translational Science Institute, Scripps Health, San Diego, CA). This randomized sham-controlled study is designed to evaluate opioid use reduction in patients with various forms of cancer pain. The study is completed and preliminary results are expected in early 2018.


• | Efficacy of the Quell Wearable Device for Chronic Low Back Pain (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). This randomized controlled study is designed to evaluate pain relief and quality of life improvements in subjects with low back pain using Quell compared to control subjects on standard therapy. The study is fully enrolled and data collection is near completion. Study results are expected in 2018.


• | Prospective Validation of Quell Sleep/Wake Classification and Periodic Leg Movement Detection (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). This study is designed to compare Quell sleep tracking to gold standard polysomnography. The study is fully enrolled and results are expected in early 2018.

7

In addition, results of internal studies based on data from Quell Health Cloud have been presented at two pain research conferences.

• | At the PAINWeek National Conference held September 5-9, 2017, in Las Vegas, NV, two scientific posters were presented. Results of a poster titled “Ambulatory Stride Variability Measured by a Wearable Device is a Biomarker for Chronic Pain Severity” suggested that automatic Quell gait measurements are an objective biomarker for pain severity. In another poster titled “Self-Reported Weather Sensitivity Stratifies Subjects with Chronic Pain”, Quell users with and without self-reported weather sensitivity showed distinct demographic and clinical characteristics, indicating that subjects with self-reported weather sensitivity express a different chronic pain phenotype than those who report weather insensitivity. 


• | At the 16th Annual Pain Medicine Meeting held November 16-18, 2017, in Orlando, FL, two scientific posters were presented. In a poster titled “Will People with Severe Chronic Pain Utilize Wearable Pain Relief Technology?”, analysis of results of demographic and clinical characteristics of Quell users suggested that older adults were as likely to adopt wearable and digital health technology as overall chronic pain sufferers. In another poster titled “Daily Utilization of Surface Neurostimulation is Associated with Reduced Pain Interference with Sleep, Activity and Mood in Subjects with Chronic Pain”, study results suggested that optimal reduction in pain intensity and pain interference with sleep, activity, and mood is most likely achieved with daily device use.

Competition
We believe there is no direct competition to our Quell wearable neuro-stimulation device for the treatment of chronic pain. The most common approach to chronic pain is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter drugs (such as Advil and Motrin), and prescription drugs including anti-convulsants (such as Lyrica and Neurontin) and anti-depressants (such as Cymbalta and Elavil). Topical creams may also be used (such as Zostrix and Bengay). With severe pain, narcotic pain medications may be prescribed (such as codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone). The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often hit or miss. Side effects and the potential for addiction are real and the risks are substantial.
Reflecting the difficulty in treating chronic pain, inadequate relief leads many pain sufferers to turn to the over-the-counter market for supplements or alternatives to prescription pain medications. These include non-prescription medications, topical creams, lotions, electrical stimulators, dietary products, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total they account for over $4 billion in annual spending in the United States on pain relief products.
High frequency nerve stimulation is an established treatment for chronic pain supported by numerous clinical studies demonstrating efficacy. In simplified outline, the mechanism of action involves intensive nerve stimulation to activate the body’s central pain inhibition system resulting in widespread analgesia, or pain relief. The nerve stimulation activates brainstem pain centers leading to the release of endogenous opioids that act primarily through the delta opioid receptor to reduce pain signal transmission through the central nervous system. This therapeutic approach is available through deep brain stimulation and through implantable spinal cord stimulation; however, both require surgery and have attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches to neuro-stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to device limitations, ineffective dosing and low patient compliance. We believe that our clinical and market claims with respect to our wearable technology covering chronic pain and sleep, technical characteristics of high power and automation, and the digital health integration characteristics place Quell in a unique neuro-stimulation category. There are numerous manufacturers of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices including widely marketed over-the-counter TENS such as Sanofi’s IcyHot SmartRelief, Omron PM3030 and Aleve Direct Therapy.
We believe that DPNCheck is currently the only objective and standardized test for DPN widely available at the point-of-care. The American Diabetes Association, or ADA, and other organizations recommend at least annual evaluation of all people with diabetes for DPN. Due to cost and availability, this screen is typically performed with a simple (5.07/10g) monofilament. This subjective method identifies late stage neuropathy where intervention is generally limited to foot care. Experts in the field have indicated that there is an unmet need for a practical, objective, and sensitive test for diabetic neuropathy that can be widely deployed in the regular care of all people with diabetes. Monofilaments (5.07/10g) are a commodity sold by a number of medical supply companies.
There are several companies that sell neurodiagnostic devices that compete with our ADVANCE System. These companies include Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. and Natus Medical Incorporated. Natus Medical Incorporated has substantially greater financial resources than we do. Natus Medical Incorporated and Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. have established reputations as having effective worldwide distribution channels for medical instruments to neurologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians.

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights, and know-how. We hold issued utility patents covering a number of important aspects of our Quell, SENSUS, DPNCheck and ADVANCE products. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors, whom we expect to work on our products, to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived, or developed using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Patents
As of December 31, 2017, we had 38 issued U.S. patents, six issued foreign patents, and 36 patent applications, including 26 U.S. applications, and 25 foreign applications. Our wearable therapeutic products have six issued U.S. utility patents, two issued foreign patents, and three issued U.S. design patents plus 37 utility and design patent applications. The foreign patents for wearable therapeutics have been assigned to GSK under the terms of the GSK Collaboration. For our DPNCheck diagnostic device, seven utility patents were issued that cover the core technology and there are six additional utility patent applications.
With regard to our legacy neurodiagnostic products, our issued design patents began to expire in 2015, and our issued utility patents began to expire in 2017. In particular, seven of our issued U.S. utility patents covering various aspects of the legacy neurodiagnostic products expired on the same date in 2017. Although the patent protection for material aspects of these products covered by the claims of the patents were lost at that time, we have additional patents and patent applications directed to other novel inventions that will have patent terms extending beyond 2017.
The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. If our products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture, and sale of these potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. Because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights.
A patent infringement suit brought against us may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party’s intellectual property, unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third-party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.
Trademarks
We hold domestic registrations for the trademarks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, OptiTherapy, DPNCheck, SENSUS, and NC-stat. We use a trademark for ADVANCE, and Wearable Pain Relief Technology. We hold certain foreign registrations for the marks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, OptiTherapy, NC-stat, and SENSUS.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Procedures performed with our neurodiagnostic medical devices including ADVANCE and DPNCheck may be paid for by third-party payers, including government health programs, such as Medicare, and private insurance and managed care organizations. The 2018 Physicians Fee Schedule published by CMS includes CPT 95905 for nerve conduction studies performed with pre-configured electrode arrays such as are used with the DPNCheck device and the ADVANCE System.
9

We believe that physicians are generally receiving reimbursement under CPT 95905 from Medicare for nerve conduction studies performed for carpal tunnel syndrome using pre-configured electrode arrays that meet the medical necessity requirements in their local Medicare region but that commercial insurers are generally not providing reimbursement. Reimbursement by third-party payers is an important element of success for medical device companies. We do not foresee a significant near-term improvement in reimbursement for procedures performed with ADVANCE and DPNCheck.
In the United States, some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis a predetermined annual payment per member which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their members. This is generally the case under Medicare Advantage where contracting insurers receive a monthly capitated fee from CMS to provide all necessary medical care to participating members. These capitated fees are adjusted under CMS’s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to ensure the adequacy of payment. Members with higher risk codes generally require more healthcare resources than those with lower risk codes. In turn, the insurer fully absorbs the risk of patient health care costs. Insurers may share a portion of the risk with provider organizations such as independent practice associations (IPAs) with whom they contract to provide medical services to their members. Proper assessment of each member’s health status and accurate coding helps to assure that insurers receive capitation fees consistent with the cost of treating these members. Nerve conduction testing can provide valuable, early identification of neuropathy leading to clinical interventions that can reduce health care costs. Also, these tests provide valuable input regarding each member’s health risk status which can result in more appropriate capitated payments from CMS. We believe that the clinical and economic proposition for DPNCheck is attractive to Medicare Advantage insurers and risk bearing provider organizations. We are focusing our sales effort for DPNCheck on the Medicare Advantage managed care market segment.
We believe that our legacy SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is considered a durable medical equipment (DME) benefit and is reimbursed for chronic pain by Medicare and many commercial insurers under HCPCS code EO730 for the device and under HCPCS code A4595 for the consumable electrodes. These pre-existing codes apply to DME benefits employing transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation equipment. We expect that Quell will generally not be reimbursed by third party payers in the near future.
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services.
Our success in selling DPNCheck and ADVANCE will depend upon, among other things, our customers receiving, and our potential customers’ expectation that they will receive sufficient reimbursement or patient capitated premium adjustments from third-party payers for procedures or therapies using these products. See “Risk Factors,” “If health care providers are unable to obtain sufficient reimbursement or other financial incentives from third-party health care payers related to the use of our products other than Quell, their adoption and our future product sales will be materially adversely affected.”
FDA and Other Governmental Regulation
FDA Regulation
Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by other regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the amount of risk associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness:

• | Class I, requiring general controls, including labeling, device listing, reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA’s quality system regulations and pre-market notification;


• | Class II, requiring general controls and special controls, which may include performance standards and post-market surveillance; and


• | Class III, requiring general controls and pre-market approval, or PMA, which may include post-approval conditions and post-market surveillance.

Before being introduced into the market, our products must obtain market clearance or approval through the 510(k) pre-market notification process, the de novo review process or the PMA process, unless they qualify for an exemption from these processes. See “Risk Factors,” “We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA which could restrict the sales and marketing of the Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck devices and the ADVANCE System, as well as other products for which we may seek FDA clearance or approval, and could cause us to incur significant costs.”
510(k) Pre-Market Notification Process
10

To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device or to a Class III device marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not required the submission of a PMA application. In some cases, we may be required to perform clinical trials to support a claim of substantial equivalence. If clinical trials are required, we must submit an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must be cleared by the FDA prior to the start of a clinical investigation, unless the device and clinical investigation are considered non-significant risk by the FDA or are exempt from the IDE requirements. It generally takes three months from the date of the pre-market notification submission to obtain a final 510(k) decision, but it can be significantly longer.
After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires the submission of a new 510(k) clearance or could require de novo classification or PMA. The FDA allows each company to make this determination, but the FDA can review the decision. If the FDA disagrees with a company’s decision not to seek FDA authorization, the FDA may require the company to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA also can require the company to cease marketing and/or recall the medical device in question until its regulatory status is resolved.
De Novo Review Process
If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because there is no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent, and if the device may be adequately regulated through general controls or special controls, the device may be eligible for de novo classification through what is called the de novo review process. In order to use the de novo review process, a company must receive a letter from the FDA stating that, because the device has been found not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device or to a Class III device marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not required the submission of a PMA application, it has been placed into Class III. After receiving this letter, the company, within 30 days, must submit to the FDA a request for a risk based down classification of the device from Class III to Class I or II based on the device’s moderate or low risk profile which meets the definition of a Class I or Class II medical device. The FDA then has 60 days in which to decide whether to down classify the device. If the FDA agrees that a lower classification is warranted, it will issue a new regulation describing the device type and, for a Class II device, publish a Special Controls guidance document. The Special Controls guidance document specifies the scope of the device type and the recommendations for submission of subsequent devices for the same intended use. If a product is classified as Class II through the de novo review process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications.
PMA Process
If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process and is not eligible for clearance through the de novo review process, a company must submit a PMA application. The PMA requires more extensive pre-filing testing than is required in the 510(k) and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA will decide within 45 days of receiving a PMA whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and if the PMA is complete, the FDA will notify the applicant that the PMA has been filed. The PMA process can take one to three years or longer, from the time the PMA application is filed with the FDA. The PMA process requires the company to prove that the medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. A PMA typically includes extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device, its design, manufacture, labeling and components. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR.
If FDA approves the PMA, the approved indications may be more limited than those originally sought. In addition, FDA’s approval order may include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with the post-approval conditions can result in adverse enforcement or administrative actions, including the withdrawal of the approval. Approval of a new PMA application or a PMA supplement may be required in the event of modifications to the device, including to its labeling, intended use or indication, or its manufacturing process that affect safety and effectiveness.
Post-Approval Obligations
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
11


• | the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide adequate information on both risks and benefits;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA any device that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;


• | correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and device recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device which may present a risk to health;


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility;


• | regular and for cause inspections by FDA to review a manufacturer’s facilities and their compliance with applicable FDA requirements; and


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations.

Regulatory Approvals and Clearances
The ADVANCE System received 510(k) clearance as a Class II medical device in April 2008 for its intended use by physicians to perform nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography procedures.
The NC-stat System is also a Class II medical device and has been the subject of several 510(k) clearances, the most recent in July 2006 (K060584). The NC-stat System is cleared for use to stimulate and measure neuromuscular signals that are useful in diagnosing and evaluating systemic and entrapment neuropathies. We believe our NC-stat DPNCheck, or DPNCheck, device is a technical modification to the 510(k) cleared NC-stat device and has the same intended use, and therefore does not raise safety or effectiveness questions. Under the FDA’s published guidance on 510(k) requirements for modified devices, we do not believe that a 510(k) submission is required for DPNCheck.
As transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators, the SENSUS and Quell pain therapy devices are Class II medical devices which received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August 2012 and July 2014, respectively. In November 2012, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the disposable electrode used in conjunction with the SENSUS device, and in July 2013, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the use of SENSUS during sleep. The intended use of the SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. In July 2014, our Quell device received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use and in November 2014, our Quell disposable electrode received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use. In January 2016, a number of new features were added to Quell and received 510(k) clearance, most notably use with an optional mobile app that contains several convenience features. The intended use of the Quell pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. The Quell device may also be used during nighttime sleep.
Federal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulatory oversight. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market Quell in the future, or criminal prosecution.
Manufacturing Facilities
12

Our facility, and the facilities utilized by Sunburst and MC Assemblies, Inc., our contract sub-assembly manufacturers, have each been inspected by FDA in the past, and observations were noted. There were no findings that involved a significant violation of regulatory requirements. The responses to these observations have been accepted by the FDA and we believe that we and our contract manufacturers are in substantial compliance with the QSR. We expect that our facility and our subcontract facilities will be inspected again as required by the FDA. If the FDA finds significant violations, we could be subject to fines, recalls, requirements to halt manufacturing, or other administrative or judicial sanctions.
U.S. Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as numerous state anti-kickback laws, prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration, whether direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, intended, among other things, to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. While the federal law applies only to products and services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, the state laws may apply regardless of whether any public healthcare funds are involved. Violations of these laws can lead to severe civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, such as us, and to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products.
Also, the federal False Claims Act, as well as many state false claims statutes, provides civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Under the federal False Claims Act, in addition to actions initiated by federal law enforcement authorities, the statute authorizes “qui tam” actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party in certain circumstances and, if successful, that private party can share in any monetary recovery. Any challenge by federal or state enforcement officials or others under these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Legacy Neurodiagnostics Business
We were founded in 1996 as a science-based health care company. Our focus had been the development of innovative products for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of peripheral nerve and spinal cord disorders, such as those associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbosacral disc disease and spinal stenosis, and diabetes. Our NC-stat System for the performance of nerve conduction studies at the point-of-care was commercially launched in 1999. The second generation NC-stat was released in 2002. In 2008, we brought to market the more sophisticated ADVANCE System for nerve conduction testing and performance of invasive needle electromyography. These systems were general purpose with broad application in evaluating and diagnosing nerve disorders. Numerous studies demonstrating the clinical accuracy and utility of these devices have been conducted and published in high quality peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, these devices have been used in FDA sanctioned clinical trials for pharmacological agents and large scale epidemiological studies sponsored by the NIH, Center for Disease Control, or CDC, and other governmental agencies. The products have been cleared by the FDA, field tested for over a decade and highly regarded for their ease of use, accuracy and reproducibility of results.
Following launch of NC-stat in 1999, we experienced rapid revenue growth, which led to our initial public offering in 2004. The health market, particularly the physician office segment, embraced the opportunity to perform nerve conduction tests which previously had always required referral to specialists. Point-of-care nerve testing was seen to provide a combination of improved patient care and patient convenience. The success of point-of-care nerve testing, a market which we created, was met with resistance in some sectors of the medical community, particularly by neurologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, both of which had traditionally provided nerve testing services. As a consequence of successful lobbying by these specialists, physicians using our technology experienced increased denials of coverage by third party payers resulting in their discontinuing usage and our difficulty in accruing new customer accounts. In late 2009 CMS included in the Physician Fee Schedule a new Category I CPT Code, CPT 95905, for nerve conduction studies performed using preconfigured electrode such as those employed with our products. During 2010 most Medicare fiscal intermediaries assumed coverage for CPT 95905 for at least some clinical indications; however, the health care environment was such that we were unable to secure broad coverage among private payers, which was essential to the success of our ADVANCE System product. This experience was reflected in our revenues for the legacy Neurodiagnostics business, which peaked in 2006 at $55.3 million. We reported revenue for our legacy Neurodiagnostics business of $1.5 million and $2.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We currently manage this business to optimize cash flow.
