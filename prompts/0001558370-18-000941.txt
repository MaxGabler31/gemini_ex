 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 Exact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exact,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a molecular diagnostics company currently focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer. We have developed an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test called Cologuard® for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests for other types of cancer, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer diagnostics. Our Cologuard Test
 Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately:
· | 140,000 new cases of colorectal cancer
--+---------------------------------------


· | 51,000 deaths from colorectal cancer
--+-------------------------------------

      Colorectal cancer treatment represents a significant, growing healthcare cost. As of 2010, $14 billion was spent annually in the U.S. on colorectal cancer treatment, and the projected annual treatment costs are expected to be $20 billion in 2020. The incidence of colorectal cancer in Medicare patients is expected to rise from 106,000 cases in 2010 to more than 180,000 cases in 2030.
     It is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease—with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer—are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Accordingly, the American Cancer Society (“ACS”) recommends that all people age 50 and older undergo regular colorectal cancer screening. Of the more than 85 million people in the U.S. for whom routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, 38 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease’s late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 70 percent and 13 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test.
     Our Cologuard test is a non-invasive stool-based DNA (“sDNA”) screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Eleven biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.
     On August 11, 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Cologuard for use as the first and only sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, “Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,” highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population:
    
· | Cancer Sensitivity: 92%
--+------------------------


· | Stage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94%
--+---------------------------------------


· | High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69%
--+--------------------------------------


· | Specificity: 87%
--+-----------------

      The competitive advantages of sDNA screening may provide a significant market opportunity. If the test were used by 40-percent of the eligible U.S. screening population of 85 million people, at a three-year screening interval, and average revenue per test of $500 to $525 per test, we estimate that our share of the U.S. market for sDNA screening would be more than $5.5 billion, annually.

 Our Cologuard Commercialization Strategy
     Our commercialization strategy includes three main elements focusing on physicians, patients, and payers.
     Physicians and Patients        Our sales team actively engages with physicians and their staffs to emphasize the need for colorectal cancer screening, educate them on the value of Cologuard, and enroll them in our physician ordering system to enable them to prescribe the test. We focus on specific physicians based on Cologuard order history and on physician groups and larger regional and national health systems. 
     Securing inclusion in guidelines and quality measures is a key part of our physician engagement strategy since many physicians rely on such guidelines and quality measures when making screening recommendations. In June 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (“USPSTF”) issued an updated recommendation statement for colorectal cancer screening and gave an "A" grade to colorectal cancer screening starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. The statement specifies seven screening methods, including FIT-DNA (which is Cologuard). 
     Many professional colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the U.S., including those of the ACS and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”), recommend regular screening using any of a variety of methods. Since 2008, joint colorectal cancer screening guidelines endorsed by the ACS have included sDNA screening technology as a screening option for the detection of colorectal cancer in average risk, asymptomatic individuals age 50 and older. In October 2014, the ACS updated its colorectal cancer screening guidelines to specifically include Cologuard as a recommended screening test. In June 2016, the NCCN updated its Colorectal Cancer Screening Guidelines to add sDNA screening, at a once-every-three-years interval, to its list of recommended screening tests. 
     In October 2016, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) included Cologuard testing on a three-year interval in the 2017 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) measures. More than 90 percent of America’s health plans measure quality based on HEDIS. In April 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) included Cologuard in its updated 2018 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings program.
     A critical part of the value proposition of Cologuard is our compliance program, which involves active engagement with patients and physicians. This customer service oriented activity is focused on helping patients to complete Cologuard tests that have been ordered for them by their physicians and supporting physicians in their efforts to have their patients screened. 
     After the launch of Cologuard, we initiated a significant public relations effort to engage patients in the United States. We have conducted targeted direct-to-patient advertising campaigns through social media, print and other channels. In 2016, we began a national television advertising campaign. To date, we have focused our efforts on cable television most commonly viewed by our target patient demographic. We continue our targeted direct-to-patient advertising initiatives. During the second and third quarters of 2017 we launched new content for our television advertising campaign, highlighting the ease of use of Cologuard, which includes 30-second television spots intended to make our television advertising more cost effective. During 2018 we plan to maintain our current television advertising efforts and increase our efforts with social and digital media and engage in national partnerships that are designed to increase awareness for Cologuard. 
     Payers
     The cornerstone of our payer-engagement strategy was securing coverage from CMS. Medicare covers approximately 47 percent of patients in the screening population for Cologuard. On October 9, 2014, CMS issued a National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) for Cologuard following a parallel review process with the FDA.  Cologuard was the first screening test approved by the FDA and covered by CMS through that process. As outlined in the NCD, Medicare Part B covers Cologuard once every three years for beneficiaries who meet all of the following criteria:
· | age 50 to 85 years,
--+--------------------


· | asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including, but not limited to, lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  5

 


· | at average risk for developing colorectal cancer (e.g., no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Pursuant to the 2017 Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, CMS reimbursed Cologuard at the rate of $512.43 per test. Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), effective January 1, 2018, the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard was set at $508.87, which was the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for Cologuard for the period from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. We expect that the CMS reimbursement rate established for 2018 will remain in place for three years and then be reset based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for Cologuard during the data collection period from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. Payments from CMS are currently subject to sequestration.
     In addition to Medicare reimbursement, we seek to secure favorable coverage and in-network reimbursement agreements from commercial payers. Some commercial payers have issued positive coverage decisions for Cologuard and we have entered into contracts with others to include Cologuard as an in-network service. In-network agreements with payers have varying terms and conditions, including reimbursement rate, term and termination. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into new agreements, certain existing agreements may expire without renewal and certain other existing agreements may be terminated early by us or the third-party payer. We believe that commercial payers’ reimbursement of Cologuard will depend on a number of factors, including payers’ determination that it is: sensitive and specific for colorectal cancer; not experimental or investigational; approved or recommended by major organizations’ guidelines; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective. Reimbursement may also be affected by whether Cologuard is in-network for a given payer. Also, some payers may apply various medical management requirements, including a requirement that they give prior authorization for a Cologuard test before they are willing to pay for it. Other payers may perform post-payment reviews or audits, which could lead to payment recoupments. Medical management, such as prior authorizations and post-payment review or audits, may require that we, patients, or physicians provide the payer with extensive medical records and other information. 
     Coverage of Cologuard may also depend, in whole or in part, on whether payers determine, or courts and/or regulatory authorities determine, coverage is required under applicable federal or state laws mandating coverage of certain colorectal cancer screening services. For example, Section 2713 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) mandates that certain health insurers cover evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of “A” or “B” in the current recommendations of USPSTF without imposing any patient cost-sharing (“ACA Mandate”). Similarly, federal regulations require that Medicare Advantage plans cover “A” or “B” rated preventive services without patient cost-sharing. Following the June 2016 update to the USPSTF colorectal cancer screening recommendation statement, CMS issued an updated Evidence of Coverage notice for Medicare Advantage plans that affirms such plans must include coverage of Cologuard every three years without patient cost-sharing. While we believe the ACA Mandate will require most health insurers to cover Cologuard without patient cost-sharing (following an initial phase-in period between one and two years from the date of the updated USPSTF recommendation statement depending on the date a given plan year commences), it is possible that certain health insurers will disagree and determine not to cover Cologuard. It may be difficult for us or patients to enforce the ACA Mandate directly, and we may need to rely on states to take enforcement action, which they may choose not to do. It is also possible that the ACA Mandate will be repealed or significantly modified in the future.
     Similarly, we believe the laws of approximately 30 states currently mandate coverage of Cologuard by certain health insurance plans. While some insurers have agreed with our interpretation regarding certain state mandates, other insurers have disagreed. In some cases, we have filed lawsuits in an effort to enforce state laws we believe require coverage of Cologuard, and we may file additional suits in the future.  We may or may not be successful in any such lawsuit.
     We are pursuing a variety of strategies to increase commercial payer coverage for Cologuard, including providing cost effectiveness data to payers to make the case for Cologuard reimbursement.  We are focusing our efforts on large national and regional insurers and health plans that have affiliated health systems. 
     We believe quality metrics may influence payers’ coverage decisions, as well as physicians’ cancer screening procedures. Some government and private payers are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate 

 
  6

 
payments for healthcare services based on the achievement of documented quality metrics, cost efficiencies or patient outcomes. Payers may look to quality measures, such as HEDIS and CMS Star Ratings, to assess quality of care. We believe inclusion in the HEDIS measures and Star Ratings measures may have a positive impact on payers’ willingness to reimburse Cologuard, as well as on physicians’ willingness to prescribe the test. 
 Our Clinical Lab Facilities
 As part of our commercialization strategy, we established a state-of-the-art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 50,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately one million tests per year. We are expanding our current facility to increase our lab processing capacity to more than two and a half million tests per year by mid-2018. 
     During the fourth quarter of 2017 we began construction of a new clinical lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin that is expected to increase our annual capacity by approximately two million tests per year. The construction is expected to be completed by mid-2019 and at that time our total capacity at both facilities should be more than four and a half million tests per year. 
    
Product Pipeline
 We also are developing a pipeline of potential future products and services. We are continuing to collaborate with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“MAYO”), our development partner for Cologuard, on developing new tests, with the goal of becoming a leader in the early detection of cancer. We believe our proprietary technology platform provides a strong foundation for the development of additional cancer diagnostic tests. Through our collaboration with MAYO, we have identified proprietary biomarkers for several major cancers, including liver cancer and lung cancer. We have successfully performed validation studies on tissue samples for seven major cancers and on blood samples for four major cancers. 
     The ACS estimates that liver cancer will be diagnosed in 42,000 Americans and cause 30,000 deaths in 2018, three-fourths of which will be hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”). Incidence and mortality rates are both increasing at approximately 3 percent per year. People who have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or Hepatitis B are at high risk of developing HCC. Evidence shows that HCC surveillance in these high-risk groups leads to earlier detection and improved outcomes. The NCCN and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (“AASLD”) guidelines recommend that these two groups be surveilled for HCC every six months using ultrasound and the blood-based biomarker alpha-fetoprotein (“AFP”). However, ultrasound and AFP are documented to have poor sensitivity for early stage cancer, which is the primary target of surveillance. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to serve as an alternative to ultrasound and AFP for use in HCC surveillance. We published a small case-control study in 2016 showing high accuracy for detecting HCC using a blood-based panel of methylation markers.
     The ACS estimates that, in the United States in 2018, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 234,000 people and cause 154,000 deaths. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to aid in the early detection of lung cancer in individuals with lung nodules discovered through a computerized tomography (“CT”) or other scan. Such a test may help reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and other follow-up procedures, and thereby reduce costs and improve health outcomes. 
    
We also continue to explore opportunities for improving Cologuard, including improvements that could lower our cost of goods or expand the usage of Cologuard to different patient populations.

 Acquisitions
     On August 1, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Sampleminded, Inc. (“Sampleminded”), the primary operations of which were customized software development for laboratory information systems and clinical information systems, for consideration consisting of $3.2 million of cash and 86,357 of our restricted stock units. Prior to the acquisition, Sampleminded provided certain consulting and software support services to us, and it licensed certain software to us. The purposes of the acquisition were to reduce costs by bringing certain technology and expertise in-house and to prepare for future growth.     Competition 
 The market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of more than 85 million Americans age 50 and above, and has attracted numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our Cologuard test faces competition from procedure‑based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and “virtual” colonoscopy, a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by CT scan (spiral computerized axial tomography), as well as traditional screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test (“FOBT”) and the fecal immunochemical test (“FIT”), and newer screening technologies such as pill-based imaging solutions like PillCam COLON, cleared by the FDA in February 2014, and C-Scan, which recently obtained a CE Mark. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
    
In addition, some companies and institutions are developing blood‑based tests based on the detection of proteins, tumor cells, nucleic acids, epigenetic markers, or other biomarkers in the blood. We are aware of at least nine companies—Epigenomics AG, Gene News, EDP Biotech Corporation, Freenome Inc., GRAIL, Inc., CellMax, Inc., Volition Diagnostics, Cambridge Epigenetix Limited, and Nucleix Ltd.—that have developed, or are developing, blood‑based (or “liquid biopsy”) tests for the detection of colorectal cancer. Epigenomics AG received FDA approval for its blood‑based screening test for colorectal cancer, Epi proColon, in April 2016, and began offering the test commercially in May 2016. Freenome Inc. is developing a blood-based test that uses artificial intelligence capabilities to screen for certain cancers and pre-cancers. GRAIL, Inc. is developing a blood-based test utilizing next-generation gene sequencing to detect genetic mutations associated with certain cancers or pre-cancers and has begun enrolling more than 100,000 patients in two new product trials. Researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine are working to develop a blood-screening test called CancerSEEK, which aims to use one test to identify the presence of eight different types of cancers, including lung, liver and colorectal cancers. 
     We believe other companies are also working on liquid biopsy tests using next‑generation sequencing or other technology, and these tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard and other tests we may develop.
     Notwithstanding that the market for colorectal cancer screening is highly competitive, we believe that Cologuard, as the first and only sDNA-based non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test on the market today, compares favorably to other products and services. All other colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity, poor compliance, and high cost. For example, colonoscopy, involves advance dietary restrictions and bowel cleansing and can be uncomfortable, time‑consuming, hazardous, and expensive. Colonoscopy requires sedation, potential lost time from work, and someone to drive the patient home from the procedure. A 2010 study shows that seven out of 10 people age 50 and older who were told they should get a colonoscopy did not do so primarily due to fears. Fecal blood testing, including FIT testing, suffers from poor sensitivity, with only a 74 percent detection rate for cancer and 24 percent detection rate for pre‑cancers. The blood‑based DNA tests currently available are also disadvantaged by relatively low sensitivity. Epigenomics AG has reported that the Epi proColon test has an overall cancer sensitivity rate of 68 percent, and only 59 percent for early-stage cancer. Additionally, FIT testing suffers from low adherence over time. One study published in the American Journal of Managed Care demonstrated that only three out of every 1,000 patients studied adhered to fecal test screening guidelines during a continuous 10-year observation period. 
    
Beyond our Cologuard test, as we seek to develop other tools to detect cancer and pre-cancer, we expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer diagnostic tools. These competitors include: 
    
· | biotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  8

 


· | academic and scientific institutions;
--+--------------------------------------


· | governmental agencies; and
--+---------------------------


· | public and private research organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------

     
We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources, or stronger business relationships. These competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. We have limited experience developing tests for detecting non-colorectal cancers and cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable testing products or services. Furthermore, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours, and they may bring those products and services to market earlier or more effectively than us.
     How We Recognize Revenue
 For tests performed where we have an agreed-upon reimbursement rate or where we can estimate the amount that we will ultimately collect at the time delivery is complete, we recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis upon delivery of a test result to an ordering physician. Accrual rates are based on the amounts that we expect to ultimately collect. We determine the amounts we expect to ultimately collect on a per-payer or per-agreement basis, using historical collections, established reimbursement rates and other adjustments. The expected amounts are typically lower than, if applicable, the agreed-upon reimbursement amounts due to several factors, such as the amount of any patient cost-sharing, the existence of secondary payers and claim denials. Upon ultimate collection, the aggregate amount received from payers and patients where reimbursement was estimated is compared to the estimates and, if necessary, the accrual rate is adjusted.  Finally, should we recognize revenue from claims on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated collections change, our financial results could be impacted in future quarters as necessary adjustments to accrual rates are made.  Historically, a portion of our revenue was recognized upon cash receipt when we were unable to reasonably estimate the amount that would ultimately be collected from a payer. Effective during the first quarter of 2017, we determined that we had the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be collected from all payers, including the impact of patient cost-share collections. Accordingly, we now recognize revenue on an accrual basis for all billed claims. 
 Our average reimbursement per test, as further defined below, was approximately $438 and $405 through December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This cumulative average Cologuard reimbursement rate may change over time due to a number of factors, such as medical coverage decisions by payers, changes in the payer mix, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, settlements reached with payers regarding previously denied claims, and our ability to collect cash payments from payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement. 
 We calculate the average Cologuard reimbursement per test on a trailing twelve-month basis for tests that are at least six months old, since it can often take that long, or in some cases longer, to collect from some payers and patients. Thus, the average reimbursement per test represents the total cash collected through December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 for tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of tests performed during those same periods. 
 The components of our revenue, as recognized upon accrual or cash receipt, were as follows: 

 | Year Ended December 31, | | 
(In thousands) | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Revenue recognized on an accrual basis | $ | 261,480 | | $ | 87,037 | $ | 36,364
Revenue recognized when cash is received | | 4,509 | | | 12,339 | | 3,073 
Total | $ | 265,989 | | $ | 99,376 | $ | 39,437

      Of the revenue recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, approximately $4.3 million relates to the one-time impact of certain payers meeting the Company’s revenue recognition criteria for accrual-basis revenue 

 
  9

 
recognition beginning with the period ended March 31, 2017. Approximately $1.0 million of this one-time impact relates to tests completed in the prior year and for which our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met until 2017.
 Research and Development

Research and development costs account for a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Our research and development expenses were $42.1 million, $33.5 million and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As we seek to expand our product pipeline by developing additional cancer diagnostic tests, which may include liver and lung cancer tests, we expect there will be a material increase to our research and development expenditures. Seasonality
 We are in the early stages of Cologuard’s commercialization and are continuing to learn how seasonal factors may affect our business.  Based on our experience to date, we expect some seasonal variations in our financial results due to a variety of factors, such as the year-end holiday period and other major holidays, vacation patterns of both patients and physicians, climate and weather conditions in our markets, seasonal conditions that may affect medical practices and provider activity, including for example influenza outbreaks that may reduce the percentage of patients that can be seen for preventive care such as colorectal cancer screening, and other factors relating to the timing of patient deductibles and co-insurance limits.  Government Regulation
 Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory facilities are subject to oversight by CMS pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states, including New York.  We are subject to many other federal and state laws, including antifraud and abuse, anti-kickback and patient privacy. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 The FDA granted premarket approval (“PMA”) for Cologuard in August 2014.  That PMA approval places substantial restrictions on how Cologuard is marketed and sold, specifically, by prescription only. Additionally, the regulations governing our approval require controls on Cologuard, including, but not limited to, manufacturing facility registration, product listing with the FDA, complying with labeling requirements, maintenance of a satisfactory quality management system, and meeting post-market surveillance requirements. In addition, as a condition of our FDA approval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study. There can be no assurance that the results of this study will be satisfactory and will not cause the FDA to modify or withdraw our approval for Cologuard.
 We may develop new diagnostic products and services that are regulated by the FDA as medical devices.  We may also develop diagnostic products or services that, under today’s laws, would be regulated as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) under CLIA.  However, as noted below, the regulation of LDTs may be in flux, as the FDA has recently retracted a proposal for increased LDT oversight.
 FDA-Regulated Medical Devices
 Unless otherwise exempted, medical devices must receive from the FDA either “510(k) clearance” or PMA before marketing them in the United States.  Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes may be costly and time consuming, but the PMA approval process is typically more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. 
 The FDA determines whether a medical device will require either 510(k) clearance or the PMA process based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. If the FDA decides one of our future products may undergo the 510(k) clearance process (class II), we would typically be required to submit a premarket notification.  In the premarket notification, we would need to demonstrate that our proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in 

 
  10

 
intended use, safety, and effectiveness to certain existing, legally marketed devices. This is a traditional 510k clearance. In some instances, the risk criteria of a device may be deemed low enough for premarket clearance, but the FDA may reject the substantial equivalence argument that is presented. In these instances, a de novo 510k pathway (“de novo”) may be available. The regulatory requirements of the de novo are similar to a PMA except that clinical evidence requirements may be less, and premarket inspections are not required.  If we were to obtain 510(k) clearance for a product and then make changes to that product, we would need to seek a new 510(k) clearance.
 The PMA process, which would be necessary if the product classification is high risk (class III), involves submitting extensive data to the FDA. These data allow the FDA to determine if the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process may include the convening of expert panels, inspection of our manufacturing facilities, and providing additional data and updates to the FDA, or new or supplemented PMA submissions, if the product is modified during the process or after approval. 
 Even if granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA may place substantial restrictions on how a device is marketed or sold, and regulations governing any medical device products require controls, including but not limited to registering manufacturing facilities, listing the products with the FDA, complying with labeling requirements, maintaining an adequate quality management system, and meeting post-market surveillance requirements. The studies required in connection with our seeking either a 510(k) clearance or PMA for any of our new diagnostics products would be costly and time intensive. There can be no assurance that the FDA would ultimately clear any 510(k) premarket notification or approve any PMA request submitted by us in a timely manner or at all. 
 Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”)
     LDTs are clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use.  Historically, LDTs have been regulated under CLIA while the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for many LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because LDTs were limited in number, were relatively simple tests, and were typically used to diagnose rare disease and uncommon conditions. 
 In October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents describing a proposed risk-based framework under which the FDA might regulate LDTs. The FDA’s draft framework proposed, among other things, premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared diagnostics currently on the market. In November 2015, the FDA issued a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs and stated the FDA is continuing to work to finalize premarket review requirements for LDTs. However, in November 2016 the FDA announced it would not issue a final guidance for LDTs. In January 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs, which confirmed it would not finalize its guidance on the regulation of LDTs to allow more time for public discussion and time for the congressional authorizing committees to develop a legislative solution. The FDA’s guidance documents, if and when finalized, or action by the FDA to exercise enforcement discretion over LDTs, may materially impact our development and commercialization of LDTs.
 Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing
 We are also subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place 

 
  11

 
administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. We perform activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services and entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities.
 Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws. For example, there are also state and international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool, blood and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Antifraud Laws/Overpayments. We are subject to numerous federal and state antifraud and abuse laws, including the Federal False Claims Act. Many of these antifraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include:
· | the submission of false claims or false information to government programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the retention of any overpayments by governmental payers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | deceptive or fraudulent conduct;
--+---------------------------------


· | excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | defrauding private sector health insurers.
--+-------------------------------------------

  We may be subject to substantial penalties for violations of anti-fraud and abuse laws, including denial of payment and refunds or recoupments, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery.
 In addition, amendments to the False Claims Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from governmental payers. Within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing payments to greater scrutiny.  On February 11, 2016, CMS published a final rule clarifying the obligation to report and return federal healthcare program overpayments.  Overpayments may occur from time to time in the healthcare industry without any fraudulent intent. For example, overpayments may result from mistakes in reimbursement claim forms or from improper processing by governmental payers. We maintain protocols intended to identify any overpayments. From time to time we may identify overpayments and be required to refund those amounts to government payers. 
 To avoid liability, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments.
 Federal and State “Self‑Referral” and “Anti-Kickback” Restrictions
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations prohibiting improper referrals for healthcare services or products, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Anti‑Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, unless an exception applies. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Sanctions for 

 
  12

 
violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.
 Self‑Referral law. The federal “self‑referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payers regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.
 Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. 
 Sunshine Act
 In 2010, Congress enacted a statute commonly known as the Sunshine Act, which aims to promote transparency. The Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS any payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, unless an exception applies. Manufacturers must also disclose to CMS any physician ownership or investment interests. Some states have similar transparency laws. Our failure to comply with any applicable transparency reporting requirements may subject us to substantial penalties.  Other Laws
 Occupational Safety and Health. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare‑related facilities. In addition, because our operations require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
 Specimen Transportation. Our commercialization activities for Cologuard subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
 Environmental. The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business.  There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the year ended December 31, 2017, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Intellectual Property
 We have intellectual property rights pertaining to sample type, sample preparation, sample preservation, biomarkers, and related methods and formulations.
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect our technologies through patent coverage. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 33 issued patents and 41 pending patent applications in the United States, and 63 issued patents and 60 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, as part of our 2009 strategic transaction with Genzyme Corporation, we exclusively license back from Genzyme, in the fields of colorectal cancer 

 
  13

 
screening and stool‑based detection of any disease or condition, the 15 patents issued and 2 pending patent applications in the United States, and 16 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions sold to Genzyme.
 As further described in the “License Agreements” section below, we acquired certain patents related to Cologuard from MDxHealth (“MDx”) on April 25, 2017 as part of a royalty buy-out agreement and patent purchase agreement. 

On December 15, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Armune Purchase Agreement”) with Armune BioScience, Inc. (“Armune”), pursuant to which we acquired intellectual property and certain other assets underlying Armune’s APIFINY®, APIFINY® PRO and APIFINY® ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE prostate cancer diagnostic tests. The portfolio of Armune assets we acquired is expected to complement our product pipeline. The total consideration was comprised of an up-front cash payment of $12.0 million and $17.5 million in contingent payment obligations that will become payable upon our achievement of development and commercial milestones using the acquired intellectual property.  In connection with the Armune Purchase Agreement, Armune terminated a license agreement pursuant to which it licensed certain patent rights and know-how from the Regents of the University of Michigan (“University of Michigan”), and we entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan with respect to such patent rights and know-how, as well as certain additional intellectual property rights. Pursuant to our agreement with the University of Michigan, we are required to pay the University of Michigan a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the licensed intellectual property.
     Each of our patents generally has a term of 20 years from its respective priority filing date. Of our issued patents referenced above, the earliest to expire will expire in 2018 and the last of these will expire in 2033.
 License Agreements
 We license certain technologies that are, or may be, incorporated into our technology under several license agreements. Generally, the license agreements require us to pay royalties based on certain net revenues received, and may require minimum royalty amounts, milestone payments, and maintenance fees. MAYO
 On June 11, 2009, we entered into a license agreement with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“MAYO”). Our license agreement with MAYO was amended and restated in February 2015 and further amended in January 2016 and in October 2017. Under the license agreement, MAYO granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain MAYO patents and patent applications, as well as a non‑exclusive, worldwide license with regard to certain MAYO know‑how. The scope of the license covers any screening, surveillance or diagnostic tests or tools for use in connection with any type of cancer, pre-cancer, disease or condition.  
 The licensed MAYO patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims that relate to sample processing, analytical testing, and data analysis associated with nucleic screening for cancers and other diseases. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and Japan. In addition to granting us a license to the covered MAYO intellectual property, MAYO agreed to make available personnel to provide us product development and research and development assistance. Under the license agreement, we assumed the obligation and expense of prosecuting and maintaining the licensed MAYO patents and are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed MAYO intellectual property. 

MAYO has agreed to make available personnel through January 2020 to provide us product development and research and development assistance.
 Pursuant to our agreement with MAYO, we are required to pay MAYO a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the licensed MAYO intellectual property, with minimum annual royalty fees of $25,000 each year through 2033, the year the last patent expires. The January 2016 amendment to the MAYO license agreement established various low single-digit royalty rates on net sales of current and future products and clarified how net sales will be calculated.  As part of the January 2016 and October 2017 amendments, the royalty rate on our net sales of Cologuard increased, but remained a low single-digit percentage of net sales. 

 
  14

 

 In addition to the royalty rates described above, we are also required to issue MAYO cash of $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $2.0 million upon each product using the licensed MAYO intellectual property reaching $5.0 million, $20.0 million and $50.0 million in cumulative net sales, respectively.
 As part of the February 2015 amendment and restatement of the license agreement, we agreed to pay MAYO an additional $5.0 million, payable in five annual installments, through 2019.
 The license agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2033 (or later, if certain licensed patent applications are issued). However, if we are still using the licensed MAYO know‑how or certain MAYO‑provided biological specimens or their derivatives on such expiration date, the term shall continue until the earlier of the date we stop using such know‑how and materials and the date that is five years after the last of the licensed patents expires. The license agreement contains customary termination provisions and permits MAYO to terminate the license agreement if we sue MAYO or its affiliates, other than any such suit claiming an uncured material breach by MAYO of the license agreement.
 Hologic
 In October 2009, we entered into a technology license agreement with Hologic, Inc. (“Hologic”). Under the license agreement, Hologic granted us an exclusive, worldwide license within the field of human stool based colorectal cancer and pre‑cancer detection or identification with regard to certain Hologic patents, patent applications and improvements, including Hologic’s Invader detection chemistry (the “Covered Hologic IP”). The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Australia and Japan. The license agreement also provided us with non‑exclusive, worldwide licenses to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of clinical diagnostic purposes relating to colorectal cancer (including cancer diagnosis, treatment, monitoring or staging) and the field of detection or identification of colorectal cancer and pre‑cancers through means other than human stool samples. In December 2012, we entered into an amendment to this license agreement with Hologic pursuant to which Hologic granted us a non‑exclusive worldwide license to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of any disease or condition within, related to or affecting the gastrointestinal tract and/or appended mucosal surfaces.
 We are required to pay Hologic a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the Covered Hologic IP.
 Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2029. The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permit termination in the event of material uncured breaches.
 MDx Health
 In July 2010, we entered into a technology license agreement with MDx Health S.A. (formerly Oncomethylome Sciences, S.A.) (“MDx”). Under the license agreement, MDx granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to sell products, and a license to sell services in the United States, in the field of in vitro diagnostic testing of fecal samples for detection of colorectal cancer and colorectal pre‑cancer to certain patents and patent applications related to DNA methylation biomarkers. The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, China and Japan. Under the license agreement we were required to make milestone-based royalty payments and a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of licensed products and services. Effective April 25, 2017, the Company and MDx entered into a royalty buy-out agreement (“Royalty Buy-Out Agreement”), which terminated the license agreement.  Pursuant to the Royalty Buy-Out Agreement, the Company paid MDx a one-time fee of $8.0 million in exchange for an assignment of certain patents covered by the License Agreement and the elimination of all ongoing royalties and other payments by the Company to MDx under the license agreement.  Also included in the Royalty Buy-Out Agreement is a mutual release of liabilities, which includes all amounts previously accrued under the license agreement.  Concurrently with entering into the Royalty Buy-Out Agreement, the Company entered into a patent purchase agreement (“Patent Purchase Agreement”) with MDx under which it paid MDx an additional $7.0 million in exchange for the assignment of certain other patent rights that were not covered by the license agreement.
