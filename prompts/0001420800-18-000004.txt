Item 1. Business
General
Colfax Corporation (the “Company”, “Colfax”, “we” or “us”) is a leading diversified industrial technology company that provides air and gas handling and fabrication technology products and services to customers around the world under the Howden and ESAB brands. The Company has been built through a series of acquisitions, as well as organic growth, since its founding in 1995. We seek to build an enduring premier global enterprise by applying the Colfax Business System (“CBS”) to pursue growth in revenues and improvements in profit and cash flow. 
Colfax began with a series of acquisitions in the fluid handling and mechanical power transmission sectors. In 2004, we divested our mechanical power transmission operations to focus on fluid handling and, through the end of 2011, made a series of strategic acquisitions in this sector.

On January 13, 2012, we closed the acquisition of Charter International plc (“Charter”), which transformed Colfax from a fluid handling business into a diversified industrial enterprise with a broad global footprint. This acquisition provided an additional growth platform in the fragmented fabrication technology sector, while broadening the scope of our fluid handling platform to include air and gas handling products.
Following the acquisition of Charter, we completed 20 acquisitions to grow and strengthen our business. Four of those acquisitions related to our fluid handling operations, which we sold in December 2017, as discussed below. During the most recent three-year period, we completed four acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment that expanded our portfolio of gas compression products and enhanced our fan product offering with ventilation control software. We also completed four acquisitions in our Fabrication Technology segment during the most recent three-year period that broadened our product offering and technology content. 
In December 2017, we completed the divestiture of our fluid handling business. This represents a strategic milestone in the development of our portfolio and strengthens our balance sheet, providing more flexibility to execute our strategic growth strategy. See Note 4, “Discontinued Operations” in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information about this transaction. We plan to continue our acquisition strategy in attractive markets that we believe will strengthen the core of our business and/or will broaden and diversify our portfolio.
Integral to our operations is the Colfax Business System, or “CBS”. CBS is our business management system including a comprehensive set of tools. It includes repeatable, teachable processes that we use to create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. We believe that our management team’s access to, and experience in, the application of the CBS methodology is one of our primary competitive strengths.
Each year, Colfax associates in every business develop aggressive strategic and operating plans which are based on the Voice of the Customer. In these plans, we are clear about our market realities, our threats, our risks, our opportunities and most importantly, our vision. Our belief is that when we use the tools of CBS to drive the implementation of these plans, we are able to uniquely provide customers with the world class quality, delivery, cost and innovation they require. We believe that performance ultimately helps our customers and Colfax sustainably grow and succeed. 
Reportable Segments
We report our operations through the Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology segments. For certain financial information, including Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 17, “Segment Information” in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Air and Gas Handling
Our Air and Gas Handling segment is a global supplier of a broad range of products, including heavy-duty centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, and gas compressors, as well as certain related products, systems, and services, which serves customers in the power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, wastewater, and general industrial and other end markets. Our air and gas handling products are principally marketed under the Howden brand name, and are manufactured and engineered 
4

in facilities located in Asia, Europe, North and South America, Australia and Africa. The products and services are generally sold directly as well as through independent representatives and distributors.
Fabrication Technology 
We formulate, develop, manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting, joining and automated welding of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys. For the year ended December 31, 2017, welding consumables represented approximately 42% of our total Net sales. Our fabrication technology products are marketed under several brand names, most notably ESAB, which we believe is well known in the international welding industry. ESAB’s comprehensive range of welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wires and fluxes using a wide range of specialty and other materials, and cutting consumables includes electrodes, nozzles, shields and tips. ESAB’s fabrication technology equipment ranges from portable welding machines to large customized automated cutting and welding systems. Products are sold into a wide range of end markets, including infrastructure, wind power, marine, pipelines, mobile/off-highway equipment, oil, gas, and mining. Our sales channels include both independent distributors and direct salespeople, depending on geography and end market.
The following discussions of Industry and Competition, International Operations, Research and Development, Intellectual Property, Raw Materials and Backlog, Seasonality, Working Capital, Associates and Company Information and Access to SEC Reports include information that is common to both of our reportable segments, unless indicated otherwise.
Industry and Competition
Our products and services are marketed worldwide. The markets served by our Air and Gas Handling segment are fragmented and competitive. Because we compete in selected niches of these markets and due to the diversity of our products and services, no single company competes directly with us across all our markets. We encounter a wide variety of competitors that differ by product line, including well-established regional competitors, competitors with greater specialization in particular markets, as well as larger competitors. The markets that our Fabrication Technology segment competes in are also served by Lincoln Electric and the welding business within Illinois Tool Works, Inc. 
Our customer base is broadly diversified across many sectors of the economy, and we believe customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. We believe the principal elements of competition in our served markets are the technical ability to meet customer specifications, product quality and reliability, brand names, price, application expertise and engineering capabilities, timely delivery and strong aftermarket support. Our management believes that we are a leading competitor in each of our markets. 
International Operations
Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may offset economic trends in individual economies and offers an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our exposure to developing economies will provide additional opportunities for growth in the future. Our principal markets outside the U.S. are in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 78% of our Net sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S., with approximately 51.2% shipped to locations in emerging markets.
Our international operations subject us to certain risks. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The majority of our sales are derived from international operations. We are subject to specific risks associated with international operations.”
Research and Development
Our research and development activities vary by operating segment, focusing on innovation; developing new products, software and services; creating new applications for existing products; lowering the cost of manufacturing our existing products; and, redesigning existing product lines to increase efficiency and enhance performance.
Research and development expense was $42.9 million, $39.3 million and $38.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts do not include development and application engineering costs incurred in conjunction with fulfilling customer orders and executing customer projects. We expect to continue making significant expenditures for research and development to 
5

maintain and improve our competitive position.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Although we highlight recent additions to our patent portfolio as part of our marketing efforts, we do not consider any one patent or trademark or any group thereof essential to our business as a whole or to any of our business operations. We also rely on proprietary product knowledge and manufacturing processes in our operations.
Raw Materials and Backlog
We obtain raw materials, component parts and supplies from a variety of global sources, generally each from more than one supplier. Our principal raw materials and components are metals, castings, motors, seals and bearings. We believe that our sources of raw materials are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
Manufacturing turnaround time for our Air and Gas Handling operating segment is generally sufficiently short to allow us to manufacture to order for most of our products, which helps to limit inventory levels. Backlog is primarily a function of requested customer delivery dates and generally ranges from several days to less than 12 months; although some orders may be delivered beyond 12 months. Backlog of air and gas handling orders as of December 31, 2017 was $0.9 billion, compared with $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. A substantial majority of the air and gas handling order backlog as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.
Seasonality
As our air and gas handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July, August and December vacation seasons. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.
Working Capital
We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements related to working capital items.
Associates
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 14,300 persons, of whom approximately 2,500 were employed in the United States and approximately 11,800 were employed outside of the United States. 
Approximately 2% of associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements with U.S. trade unions. In addition, approximately 41% of our associates are represented by foreign trade unions and work councils in Europe, Asia, Central and South America, Canada, Africa and Australia, which subjects us to arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages or strikes that have had a material adverse impact on operations. We consider our relations with our associates to be good.
