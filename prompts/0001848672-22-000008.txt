Item 1. Description of Business
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
We are a business body occupied with software development, encryption, blockchain technologies and related lines of business aimed at the broad public. We angle at users whose primary significance in a messenger application is security and privacy of sent data.
 Alongside with software related services we intend to provide software development consulting services. We expect our showpiece product to be an encrypted messenger application, currently being under development for that reason is nameless until the completion is due. We plan to develop the messenger using blockchain technologies to provide privacy and security to users and their data.
 Our messenger is a cutting-edge mobile platform with highly-secure on-the-go data-and-funds exchange environment to an end-user. Packed with bunch of redundant security and privacy tools the application is striving to meet and surpass defense-grade security requirements by employing “true end-to-end” encryption technology. We are planning to develop friendly and effective tools to control levels of own anonymity, privacy and security. That is why we are developing our messenger with using blockchain technologies, also known as Distributed Ledger Technologies, which have the opportunities of security, encryption and decentralization. 
 The functionality of our messenger based on the idea that “message is a transaction” (like tokens transactions). Our technology based on the following type of transaction for sending messages: encrypt text – generate text into transaction - sign transaction with digital authentication - send the transaction to a node – distribution to the authentication hash – the recipient approves the transaction – message decryption.
 We believe the messenger to attract attention with its features as follows,
 1.“end-to-end” encryption;
 2. a three factor verification system to be switched on/ off by the user;
 3. encryption algorithm used encryption on-web and on-device, secure tunneling of messages to disable third parties to interfere, block or, by any means, to receive, steal or hack users’ messages and information stored within the messenger application;
 4. sender anonymity;
 5. on-chat translation;
 6. on-chat money transactions and pay system;
 7. self-destructing messages.
 We have tested the concepts all the features above separately and currently we are working on its integration in the messenger platform. “On-chat money transactions and pay system” feature was tested with the prototype of digital tokens, developed especially for the test. We are not sure that that this feature may be incorporated with existing currencies. Currently, we are developing our messenger and working on the UX / UI app design. We are coding the internal application architecture and creating a database for the application algorithms implementation.
 We plan to deliver the mentioned services depending on the package ordered by a user, which can be tweaked within the settings of the messenger application. We expect to complete the development and penetrate the social applications market to achieve profitability, otherwise we may cease operations due to insufficient funds. We plan to offer the other services, the list of which can be extended or shortened depending on their profitability and popularity with the customers:
 1. Consulting services in software development business.
 2. Consulting services in data encryption.
 3. Consulting services in blockchain operation and development.
 4. Software development using blockchain technologies.
 5. Software development using encryption and data protection.
 
We plan to offer the above services to small and medium companies involved in various parts of the IT industry and companies providing services to IT entities.

  MARKETING 
 We expect the Marketing Campaign to be our main drive allowing us to penetrate the application market and attract new customers as well. The possible ways to obtain the messenger can be as one chooses - download directly via AppStore or GooglePlay Market for mobile devices, or download an installation file from our website for computers, or use an online web version directly in a web browser. We project to implement a set of marketing tools and depending on their efficiency we, possibly, either correct the strategy or exclude the ineffective tools from the campaign.
 We plan to target customers who are concerned about privacy and security of messaging. We plan to advertise our prime software product at IT workshops, hackathons, trade shows and exhibitions of software for computers and mobile devices, exhibitions and trade shows of mobile gadgets, gaming industry shows and exhibitions. 
 
We intend to advertise our messenger and consulting services by means of banners on web-forums and communities related to computer technologies, encryption and blockchain. We plan to draw the attention of users on notable social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, VK, Twitter) by placing advertising banners, GIFs, advertising posts and videos. In posts and videos, we plan to disclose the advantages of our encrypted messenger and demonstrate the main features. We project to start a social web page dedicated to the messenger for our potential users with necessary information shared and explaining media, as well as advertising media. 
 
We plan to utilize the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tool to draw the attention of web users requesting “privacy”, “secure messaging” and close in meaning requests on Google, Yandex, Yahoo and Bing. We plan to use SEO paired with context advertising services (Google AdWords, Bing Ads, Yandex Direct) to capture interest of users browsing for digital goods, tools and services corresponding to those of our own. By means of context advertising we expect to increase link-hit ratio in order to promote our messenger to the top of searches.
 We expect to attract two main kinds of customers regarding services they wish to receive. The ones referred as “users”, are granted the use of messenger application conditional on the package they would select. We expect them to be an extensive group of active users of mobile devices and computers who are more concerned about privacy and security over other features.
 The ones referred as “customers”, are expected to offer consulting services in the software development business area. They are expected to be IT professionals employed in cryptography, developing encryption systems, employed in the IT security area and development of blockchain technologies.
 
COMPETITION
 The market of social platforms and messengers is relatively new and expanding with numbers of offers. Messaging applications and platforms attract users by improving mostly design and usability whereas we have to offer services significant to modern users such as privacy and security. We expect our encryption algorithm, currently in progress of development, to allow connecting user-to-user blocking possibilities of interfering, hacking or compromising the user’s data.
 We intend to utilize blockchain technologies to sign up each financial transfer with an encrypted key, generated each time the transaction commences, thus preventing finance from being stolen. We expect this technology to protect on-chat pay system and money transfer in time of users’ transactions and we see it as our competitive advantage.
 
EMPLOYEES; IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES.
 
We are a start-up company and currently have no employees other than our sole officer and director. Ms. Strygina, our director, handle the Company’s day-to-day operations. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis.
INSURANCE
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are had a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulations will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
