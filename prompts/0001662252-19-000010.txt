Overview of key events of the year ended September 30, 2018
 
During 2017-18, the Company has continued positioning its product, NovaDerm, to enter clinical trials to gain FDA product approval. Having secured Orphan Designation for NovaDerm, we have worked with our NovaDerm manufacturer and collagen scaffold supplier to establish a GMP Facility in New Jersey. This facility is going to be capable of manufacturing clinical trial materials and will produce NovaDerm product launch materials. FDA regulations for biologics requires the clinical trial materials be manufactured by the same facility that will be used for producing product. Product approval includes the specific manufacturing site. The IND application needs to include the information about manufacturing facility and its cGMP compliance. The IND is an investigational new drug application filed in order to receive permission from the FDA to enter into the clinical trial process. As previously reported, our Pre-IND meeting with the Agency was very successful and the FDA requested some additional information and testing, which should be included in our final IND application submission. It was further agreed that the trials would initially cover 3 patients and then would be extended to 7 additional patients. When approved, NovaDerm® will be the first and only autologous, cultured skin substitute product allowed for medical use on Pediatric and Adult burns requiring grafting. This will give NovaDerm the ability to be used for treating a thermal burn that requires a graft without age restriction.
 
We estimated that the completion of the IND and the clinical trials could be completed 2020 if $8 million funding is made available in the first quarter of 2019. Full product approval and product launch is expected in 2020 if an additional $2M is made available from funding sources. Sale of NovaDerm for treatment of burns can start as soon as The FDA approves the start of NovaDerm clinical trials as long as the physician agrees to abide by the protocol described in the IND.
 
The following is a review of the major milestones achieved during the year:
 

1. | Our contract manufacturing facility for our proprietary collagen scaffolds and NovaDerm manufacturer is finishing the initial CGMP documentation and expects to be registered with the FDA in the next month or two. This was a lengthy process in which we identified certain potential product improvements that we continue to evaluate internally. The final research report was a crucial part of our FDA submissions for an Orphan Designation and Pre-IND (Investigational New Drug).

2. | We prepared our 2018 Orphan annual report to The US FDA Office of Orphan Products. In October 2018, we filed our 2018 Orphan Annual Report with the FDA Office of Orphan Products. It is a requirement to keep the FDA informed of the previous year’s activities in order to maintain NovaDerm’s Orphan Designation, as a biologic. The Orphan Designation granted is for “treatment of patients with deep-partial or full-thickness thermal burns requiring grafting”. The FDA's Orphan designation is granted to promote the development of unmet clinical needs with new therapies for rare diseases and disorders. Orphan Product terminology is applied to Orphan designated products proven safe and effective, and the approved Orphan Product entitles the product, up to seven years of US market exclusivity. In addition, there are other financial benefits along with the FDA’s support during the approval process.

3. | We are continuing to follow through on the results of our FDA pre-IND meeting. During the Pre-IND meeting, the Agency addressed our questions and provided guidance on our planned NovaDerm® development pathway going forward. It was agreed that Bovine TYPE 1 hide collagen scaffolds from Pure Med Farma, LLC (a related company) would satisfy American Society of Testing and Materials testing to fulfill current ASTM Type I requirements. We are working closely with Pure Med Farma and an independent FDA registered laboratory to ensure this testing complies.

4. | We have continued to work on finalizing the IND as funds allow. An IND application is the document filed with the FDA to request permission to proceed with clinical trials. This application includes the candidate product's research, chemistry, manufacturing controls and processes, pre-clinical safety, clinical trial protocols, and more.

Our Business Moving Forward In 2019
 
The company’s major objective for 2019 remains to secure the required funding to finalize some additional requirements of the IND application, and begin the clinical trials. It is estimated that the cost to finalize the IND will be approximately $1.5 million dollars, equipment purchases of $2 million, the cost to complete the clinical trial will be approximately 4.5 million dollars and product launch of $2 million ($10 million is needed to put NovaDerm on the market). As previously reported, our goal in obtaining this funding has been to minimize shareholders' dilution as much as possible. Consequently, we continue pursuing financing through the issuance of a debt instrument and international licensing agreements.
 
We have worked with a number of potential investors and continue to pursue the necessary funding based on our stated objectives. It has taken longer to raise the funds than originally estimated; however, we remain confident that our goal is achievable. In the interim, the officers and related parties intend to continue to fund the Company’s essential operating costs.
 
We have begun the preliminary planning for the clinical trials to the extent we are able, considering funding constraints. As previously reported, we have chosen a CRO to assist in our IND submission and conducting the trials. Clinical site selection and patient recruitment should be somewhat simpler than other clinical trials, as we are limited in site selection to the 127 burn centers qualified to treat catastrophic burns. In addition, the surgical protocol will be similar to the grafting procedures currently in use at those facilities. NovaDerm® should thus require
 minimal physician training.
 
The initial trials are planned to begin with a total of ten subjects with an Initial Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of safety on the first three subjects once they have reached 6 months follow-up. We do not intend to interrupt our trial waiting for the DSMB report. Our management has entered into manufacturing supply agreements and will be starting engineering runs shortly depending of funding. The decision meets managements requirement to set up the trials so as to allow for a seamless transition into commercial production upon approval.
 
Our First Product Candidate NovaDerm®
 
Our first cultured skin substitute product candidate, NovaDerm®, is a multi-layered tissue-engineered living skin prepared by utilizing autologous (patient’s own) skin cells. It is a graftable cultured epithelium skin substitute containing both epidermal and dermal components with a collagen base. Clinically, we expect our Cultured Skin substitute self-to-self skin graft product will perform the same as split thickness allograft skin. Our Autologous cultured skin substitute should not be rejected by the immune system of the patient, unlike porcine or cadaver cellular grafts. Immune system rejection is a serious concern in Xeno-transplant procedures which have a cellular component. The use of our cultured skin substitute should not require any specialized physician training because it is applied the same as in a standard split thickness allograft procedure.
 
NovaDerm® does not require the large harvest areas that are required when performing split thickness allograft procedures. NovaDerm is designed to need only a small area of harvest material to cover the wound. Where split thickness allograft skin can be stretched 2 to 4 times ,NovaDerm® can expand the coverage 100 to 400 times, greatly reducing scarring from harvesting. There are limits to how much burned area can be covered with the current split thickness allograft procedure. When a patient has more than 50% of their body with full thickness burns there is not enough harvest area available to cover the area so the same area harvested must be allowed to grow back the replacement skin before it can be harvested the second or third time, allowing to wound area open with high risk of infection and even mortality.
 
Clinically speaking, a product designed to treat a life-threatening condition must be available for the patient when needed. Our Culture skin substitute is being developed to be ready to apply to the patient when the patient is ready for grafting, within the first month of the patient being admitted to the hospital. Patients with serious burn injuries may not be in a condition to be grafted on a predefined schedule made more than a month in advance. Therefore, in order to accommodate the patient’s needs, we are striving to ensure that our cultured skin substitute will have an adequate shelf life and manufacturing schedule to ensure it is available whether the patient needs it the first month, or any day after, until the patient’s wound is completely covered and closed. We intend to provide the patient enough NovaDerm® to meet the patients needs in a single lot of material with adequate shelf life to be available when the patient is ready. With our extended shelf life and enough material in the first shipment the physician may perform a second grafting 5 or ten days post grafting period 1.
 
Our second product is anticipated to be TempaDerm®. TempaDerm® uses cells obtained from human donors to develop banks of cryo-preserved (frozen) cells and cultured skin substitute to provide a continuous supply of non-allogenic skin substitutes to treat much smaller wound areas on patients, such as ulcers. This product is expected to have applications in the treatment of chronic skin wounds such as diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers and venous stasis ulcers. This product is also expected to be similar to our burn indication product, except for the indications, and it will not depend totally on autologous cells. In fact, it may be possible to use the excess cultured skin that was originally produced for use on the patient that donated the cells used to grow the skin. Hopefully, TempaDerm® will be able to take this original cultured skin and use it on someone other than the original donor. As currently planned, TempaDerm® has the possibility of using banked cells, or even frozen cultured skin substitutes, to carry inventory to satisfy unknown needs or large volumes to meet the demands created in large scale disasters. Because of our focus to date on NovaDerm®, we have taken only limited steps toward the development of TempaDerm®. We may also decellularize TempaDerm or NovaDerm to make collagen wound coverings containing all the natural growth promoters found in skin.

We believe this technology has many different uses beyond the burn indication. The other uses may include chronic wounds, reconstructive surgery, other complex organs and tissues. Some of the individual components of our planned cultured skin substitute technology is expected to be developed for devices, such as tendon wraps made of collagen or collagen temporary coverings of large area wounds to protect the patients from infections while waiting for the permanent skin substitute. The collagen technology used for cultured skin substitutes, as designed, is expected to be used for many different applications in wound healing and stem cell technology and even drug delivery systems.
 
We could pursue any or all of the indications simultaneously if financing permitted, but for now we will seek approval for burns first as an Orphan Biologic Product to establish significant safety data and then Biological License Approval.
 
Competition
 
Several companies have developed or are developing products that propose to approach the markets described above. These companies include:
 

• | Amarantus Biosciences, Inc. Autologous PermaDerm Pediatric burns and Vericel/Epicel (cultured epidermal autografts mouse cells) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Organogenesis Inc/Apligrf (diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers; small area non- autologous skin DermaGraft for diabetic foot ulcers fibroblast grown on a temporary mesh) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intercytex/ ICX-SKN (fiberblast not complete skin) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RTI Biologics/ Matrix HD (Allograft –an a cellular human dermis) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of these companies has a proprietary approach to these markets, but none has yet penetrated the cell therapy markets fully. Four companies (Vericel Organogenesis, Intercytex and RTI Biologics) have products that are FDA approved for use in burn patients.
 
We believe our products to be superior in design and function and, thus, provide significant advantages over the competitors listed above. The advantages of our cultured skin substitute include simultaneous delivery of Autologous epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts organized with a unique collagen base.
 
Clinical skin replacements and grafts are in high demand for the treatment of skin injuries: they represent approximately 50% of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine market revenues. In 2009, the potential United States market for tissue-engineered skin replacements and substitutes totaled approximately $18.9 billion, based on a target patient population of approximately 5.0 million. By the year 2019, the total potential target population for the use of tissue-engineered skin replacements and substitutes is expected to increase to 6.4 million, resulting in a potential US market of approximately $24.3 billion.

Government Regulation
 
The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-85) provides that Orphan Product applications for pediatric use only, or for use in both pediatric and adult patients, that are approved on or after September 27, 2007, are assigned an annual distribution number (ADN) and may be sold for profit (subject to the upper limit of the ADN). In addition, once a product receives an Orphan BLA, the developer of the product receives up to seven years market exclusivity for a specific indication following the product’s approval by the FDA.
 
Unrestricted sales of our cultured skin substitute will require full approval after data for safety and efficacy are collected from a multi-center study. Once an IND is submitted, we expect enrollment and treatment are expected to require a one year evaluation on each patient. The final 9 months of the evaluation is expected to be only a monitoring period. After collection of data from the clinical trial and submission to FDA, six months is typically planned for FDA’s review and decision. Having an Orphan designation of which the indication is life threatening and there is an unmet need for catastrophic burns, the review time may be reduced significantly.
