ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Background and Product Offerings
Digi International Inc. ("Digi," "we," "our," or "us") was incorporated in 1985 as a Minnesota corporation. We were reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol DGII. Our World Headquarters is located at 11001 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343. The telephone number at our World Headquarters is (952) 912-3444. 
We are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical and Internet of Things ("IoT") connectivity products, services and solutions. We help our customers create next-generation connected products and deploy and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. We have two reportable operating segments under applicable accounting standards: (i) IoT Products & Services (formerly "M2M") segment; and (ii) IoT Solutions (formerly "Solutions") segment. 
Our IoT Products & Services segment consists primarily of distinct communications products and communication product development services. Among other things, these products and services help our customers create next-generation connected products and deploy and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. This segment creates secure, easy-to-implement embedded solutions and services to help customers build IoT connectivity. It also deploys ready-to-use, complete box solutions to connect remote equipment, including products from our January 2018 acquisition of Accelerated Concepts, Inc. ("Accelerated"). The IoT Products & Services segment also offers dedicated professional services for the design of specialized wireless communications products for customers. Finally, this segment offers managed cloud services that enable customers to capture and manage data from devices they connect to networks. Our IoT products and services are used by a wide range of businesses and institutions.
Our IoT Solutions segment offers wireless temperature and other condition-based monitoring services as well as employee task management services. These solutions are focused on three primary vertical markets: healthcare (including retail pharmacies), food service and transportation/logistics. The solutions are marketed as SmartSense by Digi™, formerly Digi Smart Solutions. We have formed, expanded and enhanced the IoT Solutions segment through four acquisitions. These include: the October 2015 acquisition of Bluenica Corporation ("Bluenica"), the November 2016 acquisition of FreshTemp®, LLC ("FreshTemp®"), the January 2017 acquisition of SMART Temps®, LLC ("SMART Temps®") and the October 2017 acquisition of TempAlert, LLC ("TempAlert").
For more in-depth descriptions of our primary products and services, please refer to the heading "Principal Products and Services" at the end of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
In October 2015, we sold our Etherios, Inc. customer relationship management ("CRM") consulting services business ("Etherios"), which focused on integration and configuration of enterprise resource management ("ERM") systems, including CRM systems. This part of our business principally provided integration and configuration of salesforce.com products. As a result of the sale of Etherios, we have accounted for it as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, the Consolidated Balance Sheets and notes thereto, for all periods affected, have been reclassified to reflect discontinued operations accounting for that business. For more information on this divestiture, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry and Marketplace Conditions
Current Market Conditions and Status of Our Business
We believe the marketplace for IoT products and services is in the midst of a long-term expansion. 
The performance of our IoT Products & Services segment, which is the significant majority of our sales, experienced growth primarily related to our acquisition of Accelerated in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, new product introductions and large customer deployments. Our IoT Products & Services segment sells both wired and wireless products that are either embedded into the products of original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") or as stand-alone products that allow our customers to connect a wide range of assets to networks. The growth of this segment was not universal across all products. For instance, the segment has a number of products that have been sold for many years, are in the mature phase of their life cycle and have been experiencing declining sales for several years. While we generally expect the trend of marketplace growth to continue, it is susceptible to downturns either because of general economic conditions, the continued development of technology that can make products less competitive or even obsolete and uncertainty or changes in regulatory environments. Relative to our own IoT Products & Services segment business, sales of many of our products are subject to large project-based customer deployments. As such, if we are unable to identify and commence new deployments with equal or greater significance than completed projects, our growth from period to period may be inconsistent and our IoT Products & Services segment may contract in any given period.
Our IoT Solutions segment continued to experience significant growth as we completed the acquisition of TempAlert in our first fiscal quarter. We continue to see steadily growing demand for our IoT Solutions offerings and expect this trend to continue.
Strategy
We continue to take significant steps intended to transform Digi into a company that can deliver consistent long-term growth with higher levels of profitability. This transformation began when we appointed Ronald E. Konezny as our Chief Executive Officer in December 2014 and today is centered on managing each of our operating segments towards different primary objectives.
IoT Products & Services Segment
Our IoT Products & Services segment, which represents the significant majority of our revenues is being managed with an expectation for modest revenue and profitability growth. For many years, a significant part of this business has been been based in legacy networking products that are in the mature phase of their product life cycles and have experienced declining sales. Recently we have made investments in some of these products that we believe can mitigate the overall rate of decline for this set of products. Other products in this segment are expected to grow based upon an increase in the number of entities wanting to connect remote assets in order to improve operational efficiencies, however, a significant part of this business remains based in legacy networking products. In an effort to enhance our ability to take advantage of this market trend, we recently have focused more attention on pairing our hardware offerings with our Digi Remote Manager® into bundled offerings that allow customers to remotely monitor and manage the performance of our hardware. In this segment, large sales of many of our products are project-based. As a result, this segment may experience inconsistent growth as project-based revenues can fluctuate, often significantly. We may seek to acquire hardware or other businesses that we believe can improve our market position in our IoT Products & Services segment.
In this operating environment we have taken the following steps to meet our objectives:

• | We sold our Etherios CRM consulting business in 2015. This business initially was acquired with the expectation it would drive engagements with companies that utilize the salesforce.com platform and were looking to deploy solutions within their businesses. We were not, however, rewarded in the marketplace as we had expected. As a result, we disposed of this consulting-based business that was losing money and not fully tied to our core hardware expertise. 


• | We significantly reduced the number of hardware product stock keeping units (SKUs) we produce as over time we had developed many SKUs that were customized for particular customers and not subject to high volume sales. This move to reduce available SKUs is intended to simplify our operations, improve our ability to manage inventory effectively, improve channel stocking strategies and control costs. SKUs have been reduced from close to 5,000 at the beginning of fiscal 2016 to just under 1,000 at September 30, 2018.

• | We consolidated and relocated office locations to improve efficiencies and provide costs savings. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we moved our Digi Wireless Design Services team from an office in downtown Minneapolis to our World Headquarters in suburban Minnetonka. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we closed our office in Dortmund, Germany and moved the corresponding positions to an existing office in Munich, Germany. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced the closure of our Paris, France office to further consolidate European operations in our Munich office. 


• | We acquired Accelerated in January 2018 to further enhance our existing cellular product lines and immediately extend our market reach with a line of commercial routers and network appliance products (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).


• | In October 2017, we added new leadership to our IoT Products & Services group in the areas of product management and research and development to drive greater alignment around the products we bring to market to meet the needs and desires of potential customers in key markets in a timely manner. We believe this increased alignment levered our technical capabilities and drove more consistent growth. In March 2018, we hired new leadership for our sales team in EMEA, a region that we have targeted as an opportunity for growth. 


• | In June 2018, we appointed a new Chief Financial Officer who has held a wide range of leadership positions managing financial and business operations for public companies.


• | In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a restructuring of our manufacturing operations in our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facility to existing contract manufacture suppliers. This move was made to reduce our operating expenses and better position our employees to drive positive results in our operations through increased collaboration. 


• | In November 2018, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we announced an executive appointment designed to lead our IoT Products & Services segment to more closely address market needs and provide greater alignment with our organizational structure.

IoT Solutions Segment
Our IoT Solutions segment, which has grown from no revenue during fiscal 2015 to almost 11.8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018, is being managed primarily for significant revenue growth. The segment was formed and has been grown primarily through four acquisitions: Bluenica in October 2015, FreshTemp® in November 2016, SMART Temps® in January 2017 and TempAlert in October 2017. While we expect that this segment still represents a modest overall portion of total revenues, we have high organic growth expectations and it will take time for it to represent a significantly greater position absent further growth through acquisitions. 
This business helps customers track the completion of employee tasks and monitor temperature and other conditions important to preserve the quality of perishable or other sensitive inventories. Our efforts have created a market-leading, high-growth hardware enabled service business with significant recurring revenue potential. We now serve over 54,000 customer sites for many leading brands in the following vertical markets: healthcare (including retail pharmacies), food service and transportation/logistics. To date we have experienced almost no customer churn. Subsequent to end of fiscal 2018, one customer representing about 3,000 sites in the transportation sector decided to terminate their relationship with this business. However, we are currently in the process of, and have had success, with negotiating direct agreements with impacted end-users to continue their monitoring services. We believe this termination is an isolated event and does not represent a trend.
We have entered this marketplace aggressively for several reasons. First, it provides us a stream of recurring revenues that comes from a large addressable market that has not been penetrated significantly. Restaurants, pharmacies, hospitals and other businesses that maintain significant inventories of perishable or other sensitive goods are a large part of the market. These businesses presently rely primarily on employees to log the temperature or other environmental conditions of these goods as well as the completion of other operating tasks using pen and paper. This is not as cost effective as using wireless communications sensors to track conditions automatically and provide real time alerts if established parameters are breached. It also is not as effective for tracking the completion of other tasks as using an application-enabled smart phone or other wireless communications device. Second, at present this marketplace primarily is served by smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to provide hardware-enabled implementation services to customers in as effective and efficient a manner as we are able to do because of our long-standing history as an IoT hardware provider. Third, we believe customers in this marketplace will not require significant customization or development of existing products before they will commit to purchase the solution. This differs from many of our hardware customers who historically often have asked us to create a highly customized product that cannot be easily sold to other parties. Fourth, by protecting valuable goods that often impact health and safety, the solution provides a clear return on investment for potential customers whose business and reputation is highly 
3

reliant on maintaining safe operations. Fifth, increasingly, we are seeing our customers use our analytics capabilities to provide unique insights that aid the management of their enterprise operations.
We believe this marketplace represents an opportunity for significant revenue growth that is both recurring and high-margin in nature. To that end, our primary aim with this business presently is to manage it for customer acquisition and revenue growth while ensuring that we do not negatively impact our overall profitability in any material way.
In April 2018, we announced that Digi Smart Solutions was rebranded SmartSense by Digi™. We intend to take steps to simplify our operations, reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue to increase our profit and expand this business in ways that we believe can drive long-term profitable growth. 
In November 2018, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we announced an executive appointment designed to lead our IoT Solutions segment to more closely address market needs and provide greater alignment with our organizational structure.
We will continue to seek and evaluate acquisitions that will further enhance our IoT Solutions segment as we believe this marketplace offers a path to a significant base of recurring revenue that can provide both stable revenue generation and significant growth for us. 
Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisitions
Since fiscal 2015, we have acquired four businesses that form the basis of our IoT Solutions segment and one business that is included in our IoT Products and Services segment (see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
In October 2015, we acquired Ontario-based Bluenica. Bluenica focused on temperature monitoring of perishable goods in the food industry by using wireless sensors which are installed in grocery and convenience stores, restaurants, and in products during shipment and storage to ensure that quality, freshness and public health requirements are met.
In November 2016, we acquired Pittsburgh-based FreshTemp®. FreshTemp® offered restaurants, convenience stores and other retailers the ability to monitor the temperature of food products automatically through the use of wireless sensors. The company also enabled these businesses to track the completion of operational tasks by their employees that could impact human health and safety in real time - a capability that we believe significantly enhanced our product offering.
In January 2017, we acquired Indiana-based SMART Temps®. SMART Temps® provided real-time foodservice temperature management for restaurant, grocery, education and hospital settings as well as real-time temperature management for pharmacy, blood bank and laboratory environments. The acquisition significantly expanded our customer base, especially in the pharmacy and education marketplaces.
In October 2017, we acquired Boston-based TempAlert, a provider of automated, real-time temperature monitoring and task management solutions for the healthcare, industrial and food service industries. This acquisition more than doubled the number of customer sites we monitored while enhancing our ability to analyze data collected from our services.
In January 2018, we acquired Tampa-based Accelerated, a provider of secure, enterprise-grade, cellular (LTE) networking equipment and backup connectivity applications. This acquisition expanded our IoT Products and Services segment by enhancing our existing cellular product lines and extended our market reach with a line of commercial routers and network appliance products. 
Disposition
In October 2015, we sold our Etherios CRM consulting services business to West Monroe Partners, LLC. We sold Etherios as part of a strategy to focus on providing highly reliable machine connectivity solutions for business and mission-critical application environments (see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
These are the only acquisitions and dispositions we have completed in the past five years. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire businesses as they arise and may seek to divest businesses or assets we no longer consider appropriate to our long-term strategy.

Sales Channels
We sell our IoT Products & Services through a global network of distributors, systems integrators and value added resellers ("VARs") which accounted for 50.9%, 61.5% and 66.1% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also complete sales of both Iot Products & Services and IoT Solutions through our own dedicated sales organization to OEMs and other customers which accounted for 49.1%, 38.5% and 33.9% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Distributors
Our larger distributors, based on sales we make to them, include Anewtech Systems, Arrow Electronics, Atlantik Elektronik GmbH, Avnet, Digi-Key, Express Systems & Peripherals, Ingram Micro, Miel, Mouser Electronics, Sapply, Solid State Supplies, Symmetry Electronics, Synnex, Tech Data and Tokyo Electron Device. We also maintain relationships with many other distributors in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Strategic Sales Relationships 
We maintain alliances with other industry leaders to develop and market technology solutions. These include many major communications hardware and software vendors, operating system suppliers, computer hardware manufacturers, enterprise application providers and cellular carriers. Among others, partners include: AT&T, Bell Mobility, NXP, Orange, Rogers, Silicon Laboratories, Sprint, Telus, Telit, T-Mobile, Verizon, Vodafone and several other cellular carriers worldwide. Furthermore, we maintain a worldwide network of authorized developers that extends our reach into certain other technology applications and geographical regions.
We have established relationships with equipment vendors in a range of industries such as energy, industrial, retail, transportation, medical, and government that allow the vendors to ship our products and services as component parts of their overall solutions. Our products are used by many of the world’s leading telecommunications companies and Internet service providers, including AT&T, Sprint and Verizon.
No single customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for any of the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Competition
We compete primarily in the communications technology industry, which is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. This market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. In addition, we may compete with other companies to acquire new businesses or technologies and the competition to secure such assets may be intense. We compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features, service and software application capabilities, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, alliance relationships, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price and availability. While no competitor offers a comparable range of products and services, various companies do compete with us with respect to one or more of our products or solutions. With respect to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who dedicate more resources and attention to that particular offering than we are able to do given the breadth of our business. As the marketplace for IoT connectivity products and solutions continues to grow, we expect to encounter increased competition. Some of these competitors may have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess.
Manufacturing Operations
Our manufacturing operations are conducted through a combination of internal manufacturing and external subcontractors specializing in various parts of the manufacturing process. We rely on third party foundries for our semiconductor devices that are Application Specific Integrated Circuits ("ASICs") and we outsource printed circuit board production. This approach allows us to reduce our fixed costs, maintain production flexibility and optimize our profits. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a restructuring to our manufacturing operations and will transfer the manufacturing functions of our Eden Prairie operations facility to existing contract manufacture suppliers. This move further leverages the manufacturing strength of our vendors and further allows us to focus on new product introductions. The move to outsource falls in line with industry practices. The current facility will continue to house the operations team, which will support contract manufacturers as well as oversee the planning and procurement of finished goods and product fulfillment, logistics and quality. 
Our products are manufactured to our designs with standard and custom components. Most of the components are available from multiple vendors. We have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. If these suppliers are unable to provide a timely and reliable supply 
5

of components, we could experience manufacturing delays that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a material way.
Seasonality
In general, our business is not considered to be highly seasonal, although our first fiscal quarter revenue is often less than other quarters due to holidays and fewer shipping days. 
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations. We believe that our current financial resources, cash generated from operations and our capacity for debt and/or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations for the next twelve months and beyond.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property Rights
Due to rapidly changing technology in the communications technology industry, we believe a large part of our success depends upon the product and service development skills of our personnel as well as our ability to integrate any acquired technologies with organically developed technologies. While we dedicate significant resources to research and development, many of our competitors are focused on a smaller set of products than us and are likely able to dedicate more resources than us toward the portions of the market in which we compete with them. 
Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks.
We have established common law and registered trademark rights on a family of marks for a number of our products. Our IoT Products and Services primarily are sold under the Digi, Rabbit® and Digi XBee® brands. We believe that the Digi and Rabbit® brands have established strong identities with our targeted customer base and our customers associate the Digi brand with "reliability" and the Rabbit® brand with "ease of integration." We believe that our customers associate Digi XBee® with "ease of use." Many of our customers choose us because they are building a very complex system solution and they want the highest level in product reliability and ease of integration and use. Our IoT Solutions are offered under the SmartSense by Digi™ brand, which enables organizations to drive operational excellence through sensor-based insights.
Our patents are applicable to specific technologies and are valid for varying periods of time based on the date of patent application or patent grant in the U.S. and the legal term of patents in the various foreign countries where patent protection is obtained. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company and products.
Backlog
Backlog as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $34.4 million and $25.3 million, respectively. The majority of the backlog at September 30, 2018 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2019. Backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of our future sales trends.
Employees
We had 516 employees on September 30, 2018. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our primary products and services for each operating segment are as follows:
IoT Products & Services Segment
