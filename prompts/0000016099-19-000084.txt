Item 1. Business
Overview
Luby’s, Inc. is a multi-branded company operating in the restaurant industry and in the contract food services industry. Our core brands include Luby’s Cafeteria, Fuddruckers - World’s Greatest Hamburgers® and Luby’s Culinary Contract Services. We also operate another restaurant brand named Cheeseburger in Paradise.

In this Form 10-K, unless otherwise specified, “Luby’s,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “Company” refer to Luby’s, Inc., Luby's Fuddruckers Restaurants, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company ("LFR") and the consolidated subsidiaries of Luby’s, Inc. References to “Luby’s Cafeteria” refer specifically to the Luby’s Cafeteria brand restaurant.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 our internal organization and reporting structure supported three reportable segments; Company-owned restaurants, Fuddruckers franchise operations and Culinary contract services. The Company-owned restaurants consisted of the three brands discussed above, which were aggregated into one reportable segment.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we re-evaluated our reportable segments and disaggregated the Company-owned restaurants into three reportable segments based on brand name.  As such, as of the fourth quarter 2019, our five reportable segments are Luby’s cafeteria restaurants, Fuddruckers restaurants, Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurants, Fuddruckers franchise operations and Culinary contract services. Management believes this change better reflects the priorities and decision-making analysis around the allocation of our resources and better aligns to the economic characteristics within similar restaurant brands. We began reporting on the new structure in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The segment data for the comparable periods presented has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Recasting this historical information did not have an impact on the consolidated financial performance of Luby’s Inc. for any of the periods presented.
We are headquartered in Houston, Texas. Our corporate headquarters is located at 13111 Northwest Freeway, Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77040, and our telephone number at that address is (713) 329-6800. Our website is www.lubysinc.com. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other filings with the SEC.

As of November 15, 2019, we operated 120 restaurants located throughout the United States, as set forth in the table below. These establishments are located in close proximity to retail centers, business developments and residential areas. Of the 120 restaurants, 71 are located on property that we own and 49 are located on property that we lease. Five of our owned locations and one of our leased locations consist of a side-by-side Luby’s Cafeteria and Fuddruckers restaurant, to which we refer herein as a “Combo location.” The Combo location properties are included in both the Luby's Cafeterias count and the Fuddruckers Restaurants count.

In November 1997, a prior owner of the Fuddruckers - World’s Greatest Hamburgers® brand granted to a licensee the exclusive right to use the Fuddruckers proprietary marks, trade dress, and system to develop Fuddruckers restaurants in a territory consisting of certain countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. As of November 15, 2019, this licensee operates 35 restaurants that are licensed to use the Fuddruckers proprietary marks in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, and Kuwait. The Company does not receive revenue or royalties from these restaurants.
For additional information regarding our restaurant locations, please read “Properties” in Item 2 of Part I of this report.

Luby’s, Inc. (formerly, Luby’s Cafeterias, Inc.) was founded in 1947 in San Antonio, Texas. The Company was originally incorporated in Texas in 1959, with nine cafeterias in various locations, under the name Cafeterias, Inc. It became a publicly held 
7

corporation in 1973, and became listed on the NYSE in 1982. The Company's operations continue to be conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiary, LFR.
Board Special Committee

In September 2019, the Company's Board of Directors formed a new Board Special Committee comprised of independent directors with the purpose of establishing a strategic review process to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to the Company with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. The Board Special Committee consists of the following members: Gerald Bodzy, Twila Day, Joe McKinney, Gasper Mir, John Morlock, and Randolph Read. The Board Special Committee is co-chaired by Messrs. Bodzy and Read.
Brookwood and Associates, previously engaged by the Company, is advising the Board Special Committee as a financial advisor to assist in certain aspects of the strategic alternatives review process. The Special Committee has retained Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP to advise on various legal matters.
The Board of Directors has not made a decision to enter into any transaction at this time, and there are no assurances that the consideration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction. The Company does not intend to comment on or disclose developments regarding the process unless it deems further disclosure appropriate or required. Please see "Risk factors" in Item 1A.
Operational Focus 
Our operational focus is to generate consistent and sustainable same-store sales growth and improved store level profit. From an operating standpoint, we support this strategic focus through the following: 

1. | Striving for consistently successful execution: Every day, with every guest, at every restaurant we operate.


2. | Developing our human capital: Our team members are the most critical factor in ensuring our Company’s success. Our relentless focus as a company must be inspiring and developing our team members to delight our guests. 


3. | Raising awareness of our brand: Our restaurants provide guests in our local communities with memories of family, friends, childhood, a great date, a memorable birthday, or a significant accomplishment. The most reliable ways to grow and sustain our business is to perpetuate word of mouth and remain involved in the community. We must share our story with our guests in our restaurants. This allows new guests to learn our brand story and also reaffirms it with legacy and loyal guests. Loyal guests spread the word about our brand. Our most loyal guests typically agree to be in our E-club so we can communicate with them and reward them. Digital media marketing and advertising has become an integral component of our guest outreach efforts. 


4. | Maintaining restaurant appearances: We recognize the importance of maintaining our legacy restaurants to remain relevant and appealing to keep loyal guests coming back and to draw in new guests.


5. | Cost management: We evaluate each area of our business to assess that we are spending and investing at appropriate levels. This includes restaurant operating costs and corporate overhead costs. Within our restaurants, we seek opportunities with our food and supplies purchasing, menu offerings, labor productivity, and contracts with restaurant service providers to maintain an appropriate restaurant level cost structure. Within our corporate overhead, we continue to seek opportunities to stream-line corporate overhead, evaluate outsourcing certain corporate functions, and optimize staffing levels. 

We remain focused on the key drivers of our businesses to achieve operational excellence of our brands and to efficiently manage costs to grow profitability and enhance shareholder value.
Luby’s Cafeteria Operations

At Luby’s Cafeterias, our mission is to serve our guests convenient, great tasting meals in a friendly environment that makes everyone feel welcome and at home. We do things The Luby’s Way, which means we cook in small batches from scratch using real food, real ingredients prepared fresh daily, and our employees and our company get involved and support the fabric of our local communities. We buy local produce as much as possible. We promise to breathe life into the experience of dining out and make every meal meaningful. We were founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1947.

Our cafeteria food delivery model allows customers to select freshly-prepared items from our serving line including entrées, vegetables, salads, desserts, breads and beverages before transporting their selected items on serving trays to a table or booth of their choice in the dining area. Each restaurant offers 15 to 22 entrées, 12 to 14 vegetable dishes, 8 to 10 salads, and 10 to 12 varieties of desserts daily.

Luby’s Cafeteria’s product offerings are home-style made-from-scratch favorites priced to appeal to a broad range of customers, including those customers that focus on fast wholesome choices, quality, variety, and affordability. We have had particular success among families with children, shoppers, travelers, seniors, and business people looking for a quick, freshly prepared meal at a fair price. All of our restaurants sell food-to-go orders and third party delivery orders which comprised approximately 17% of our Luby's Cafeteria restaurant sales in fiscal 2019.

Menus are reviewed periodically and new offerings and seasonal food preferences are regularly incorporated. Each restaurant is operated as a separate unit under the control of a general manager who has responsibility for day-to-day operations, including food production and personnel employment and supervision. Restaurants generally have a staff led by a general manager, an associate manager and assistant managers. We grant authority to our restaurant managers to direct the daily operations of their stores and, in turn, we compensate them on the basis of their performance. Each general manager is supervised by an area leader. Each area leader is responsible for approximately 7 to 11 restaurants, depending on the area supervised.

In fiscal 2019, we closed five Luby's Cafeterias. The number of Luby’s Cafeterias was 79 at fiscal year-end 2019.

Fuddruckers Restaurants

At Fuddruckers, our mission is to serve the World’s Greatest Hamburgers® using only 100% fresh, never frozen, all American premium beef, buns baked daily in our kitchens, and the freshest, highest quality ingredients on our “you top it” produce bar. With a focus on excellent food, attentive guest service and an inviting atmosphere, we are committed to making every guest happy, one burger at a time! Fuddruckers restaurants feature casual, welcoming dining areas where Americana-themed décor is featured. Fuddruckers was founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1980.

While Fuddruckers’ signature burgers and fries account for the majority of its restaurant sales, its menu also includes exotic burgers, such as buffalo and elk, chicken breast sandwiches, hot dogs, a variety of salads, chicken tenders, hand breaded onion rings, soft drinks, handmade milkshakes, and bakery items. A variety of over 100 carbonated soft drinks including our own unique Sweet Cherry Cream Soda, which is exclusively offered at Fuddruckers restaurants, along with other varieties such as Powerade®, and flavored waters are offered through Coke Freestyle® self-service dispensers. Additionally, beer and wine are served and, generally, account for less than 2% of restaurant sales. Food-to-go sales comprise approximately 8% of Fuddruckers restaurant sales.

Restaurants generally have one general manager with two or three assistant managers and a number of full-time and part-time associates working in overlapping shifts. Since Fuddruckers generally utilizes a self-service concept, similar to fast casual, it typically does not employ waiters or waitresses. Fuddruckers restaurant operations are currently divided into a total of four geographic areas, each supervised by an area leader. Each area leader is responsible for approximately 6 to 15 restaurants, depending on the area supervised.
In fiscal 2019, we closed 11 Company-owned Fuddruckers restaurants and transitioned 5 Company-owned Fuddruckers restaurants to a franchisee. The number of Fuddruckers restaurants was 44 at fiscal year-end 2019.

Fuddruckers Franchising 
Fuddruckers offers franchises in markets where it deems expansion to be advantageous to the development of the Fuddruckers concept and system of restaurants. A standard franchise agreement generally has an initial term of 20 years. Franchise agreements typically grant franchisees an exclusive territorial license to operate a single restaurant within a specified area, usually a four-mile radius surrounding the franchised restaurant. Luby’s management will continue developing its relationships with our franchisees over the coming years and beyond.

Franchisees bear all direct costs involved in the development, construction and operation of their restaurants. In exchange for a franchise fee, we provide franchise assistance in the following areas: site selection, prototypical architectural plans, interior and exterior design and layout, training, marketing and sales techniques, assistance by a Fuddruckers “opening team” at the time a franchised restaurant opens, and operations and accounting guidelines set forth in various policies and procedures manuals.

All franchisees are required to operate their restaurants in accordance with Fuddruckers standards and specifications, including controls over menu items, food quality and preparation. We require the successful completion of our training program by a minimum 
9

of three managers for each franchised restaurant. In addition, franchised restaurants are evaluated regularly for compliance with franchise agreements, including standards and specifications through the use of periodic, unannounced on-site inspections, and standards evaluation reports.

The number of franchised restaurants was 102 at fiscal year-end 2019.
Culinary Contract Services

Our CCS segment consists of a business line servicing long-term acute care hospitals, acute care medical centers, ambulatory surgical centers, retail grocery stores, behavioral hospitals, sports stadiums, senior living facilities, government, and business and industry clients, primarily in Texas. The healthcare accounts are full service and typically include in-room delivery, catering, vending, coffee service, and retail dining. Our mission is to re-define the contract food industry by providing tasty and healthy menus with customized solutions for healthcare, senior living, business and industry and higher education facilities. We seek to provide the quality of a restaurant dining experience in an institutional setting. At fiscal year-end 2019, we had contracts with 12 long-term acute care hospitals, 7 acute care hospitals, three business and industry clients, three sport stadiums, one governmental facility, one medical office building, two senior living facilities, one behavioral facility and one freestanding coffee venue located inside an office building. We have the unique ability to deliver quality services that include facility design and procurement as well as nutrition and branded food services to our clients. 

For additional information regarding our business segments, please read Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Luby’s, Inc. owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information, including the Luby’s and Fuddruckers logos, trade names and trademarks, which are of material importance to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks, and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. Patents, copyrights, and licenses are of varying durations. The success of our business depends on the continued ability to use existing trademarks, service marks, and other components of our brands in order to increase brand awareness and further develop branded products. We take prudent actions to protect our intellectual property.
Employees

As of November 15, 2019, we had an active workforce of 6,133 employees consisting of restaurant management employees, non-management restaurant employees, CCS management employees, CCS non-management employees, and office and facility service employees. Employee relations are considered to be good. We have never had a strike or work stoppage, and we are not subject to collective bargaining agreements.
