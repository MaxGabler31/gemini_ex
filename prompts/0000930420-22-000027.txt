ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Kforce Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kforce”) is a leading domestic provider of technology and finance and accounting talent solutions to innovative and industry-leading companies. While Kforce was incorporated in 1994 and completed its initial public offering (IPO) in August 1995, we have been providing domestic staffing services through our predecessor companies since 1962.
We have driven significant, strategic change at Kforce over the last decade including, but not limited to, streamlining the focus of our business on providing technology talent solutions. This strategic shift was bold and transformative but well-founded in our belief as we exited the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis that technology was going to be the epicenter of business strategies. Since the financial crisis, we successfully divested a number of businesses that we didn’t believe aligned with our vision to become a technology-focused organization. Those divestitures included our clinical research business (sold in March 2012), our healthcare staffing business (sold in August 2014), the assets of a business based in Manila, Philippines (sold in September 2017), our federal government solutions business (sold in April 2019), and our federal government product business (sold in June 2019). Our Technology business now comprises nearly 85% of overall revenues with the remainder being our finance and accounting (“FA”) business.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our workforce has been working remotely since March 2020. We recognized early on in the COVID-19 pandemic that there was very likely to be a permanent shift in the workplace and, thus, initiated what we refer to as our Kforce Reimagined initiative in May 2020. While we elaborate more on this initiative in the “Business Strategies” section below, we began looking critically at our physical office footprint, which was approximately 51 offices (50 leased, 1 owned) geographically dispersed across the U.S. and roughly 0.4 million square feet of space. Our future flexible work environment has allowed us to reduce our current footprint to 36 leased offices. In May 2021, we sold our 128,000 square foot corporate headquarters and signed a lease for our new corporate headquarters, comprising roughly 22,000 square feet, in September 2021. Once we have transitioned our remaining offices to align with our “Office Occasional” strategy, this is expected to reduce our overall square footage to be at least 60% to 70% lower than our pre-pandemic footprint. Our corporate headquarters is in Tampa, Florida.
Kforce serves clients across many industries and organizations of all sizes, but with a particular focus on serving Fortune 1000 and other large companies. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 25% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Except as specifically noted, our discussions in this report exclude any activity related to the federal government divestitures noted above (which comprised our GS segment). Refer to Note 2 - “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, for a more detailed discussion.
Our quarterly operating results can be affected by:
•the number of billing days in a particular quarter;
•the seasonality of our clients’ businesses;
•increased holidays and vacation days taken, which is usually highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year; and
•increased costs as a result of certain annual U.S. state and federal employment tax resets that occur at the beginning of each calendar year, which negatively impacts our gross profit and overall profitability in the first fiscal quarter of each calendar year.
Our Technology and FA businesses represent our two operating segments.
Our Technology Business
We provide talent solutions by comprehensively understanding our clients’ requirements and matching their requirements with qualified candidates in highly skilled areas including, but not limited to, systems/applications architecture and development (mobility and/or web), data management and analytics, business and artificial intelligence, machine learning, project and program management, and network architecture and security.
One of our strategies over the last several years has been to invest in our managed teams and project solutions capabilities in order to provide a higher-value, differentiated offering to our clients. We believe Kforce has been successfully winning these more complex engagements due to the strong, long-standing partnerships we have built with our clients, our reputation for delivering quality services and our capability in identifying quality technology talent. 
We provide our clients with qualified individuals (“consultants”), or teams of consultants on a temporary basis when the consultant's set of skills and experience is the right match for our clients. We refer to this as our Flex offering, which comprised roughly 98% of overall Technology revenues in 2021. We also identify qualified individuals (“candidates”) for permanent placement with our clients. We refer to this as our Direct Hire offering, which comprised approximately 2% of overall revenue in 2021. 
We provide services to clients in a variety of industries with a diversified footprint in, among others, financial and business services, communications, insurance, retail and technology. No single industry represents more than approximately 16% of overall Technology revenues. In addition, no single client comprised more than 5% of overall Firm revenues. 
The September 2021 report published by Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) stated that temporary technology staffing is expected to experience growth of 11% and 6%, respectively, in 2021 and 2022. Digital transformation, as a general trend, is driving organizations across all industries to increase their technology investments as competition and the speed of change intensifies. Nontraditional competitors are also entering new emerging technologies and markets. This development puts increased pressure on companies to invest in innovation and the evolution of their business models. We believe the secular drivers of technology spend is driving many companies to become increasingly dependent on the efficiencies provided by technology and the need for innovation to support business strategies and sustain relevancy in today’s rapidly changing marketplace. At the macro level, demand is also being driven by an ever-changing and complex regulatory and employment law environment, which increases the overall cost of employment for many companies. We believe that these factors, among others, are continuing to drive companies to look to temporary staffing and solutions providers, such as Kforce, to meet their human capital needs.
We believe the performance of our Technology business in 2021 was exceptional and was organically record-setting for us as revenues improved 22.3% on a year-over-year basis to $1.27 billion and in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 exceeded 30% growth on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance follows 2020 where our Technology business was only down 1.2% year-over-year in an extraordinarily challenging macro-environment given the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The average bill rate in 2021 was approximately $81 per hour, which increased 2.9%, as compared to 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our average bill rate improved 3.8% year-over-year. Our average assignment duration is approximately 10 months, which has steadily increased over the last several years. We continue to benefit from an improving bill rate environment and longer assignment durations, which we believe is related to the acute labor shortage, particularly the shortage of labor for highly-skilled positions. In addition to our capability to source highly qualified U.S. domestic technology talent, we believe an important differentiator in a candidate-constrained environment is our capability to source highly qualified foreign-born talent working domestically in the U.S. in higher-end technology roles. We maintain this capability on a centralized basis, which we believe allows us to operate consistently with a keen focus on ensuring compliance in this highly regulated space.
Our Flex and Direct Hire offerings improved 21.7% and 59.0%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.
We are very pleased with our performance in our Technology business in 2021, which exceeded the SIA benchmark of growth by two times for 2021 and nearly three times in the second half of 2021. We believe our strategic position and momentum going into 2022 has positioned us well to continue delivering significantly above-market growth in 2022, in what we believe will be a continued strong demand environment for our services. 
Our FA Business
The talent solutions we offer our clients in our FA business include consultants in traditional finance and accounting roles such as: financial, planning and analysis; business intelligence analysis; accounting; transactional accounting (e.g. payables, billing, cash applications, receivables); business and cost analysis; and taxation and treasury. We have also provided our clients with consultants in lower skilled areas such as: loan servicing and support; customer and call center support; data entry; and other administrative roles.
Over the last few years, we have been repositioning our FA business to focus on more highly skilled assignments that are less susceptible to technological change and automation and more closely aligned with our Technology business. We will continue to support certain clients by providing consultants in lower skilled roles where we have long-standing relationships and that are strategically important to our overall success. We believe we have made good progress in this transition as is evidenced by our overall average bill rate in FA, excluding the COVID-19 business (defined below), increasing approximately 10% in the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis.
We provide services to clients in a variety of industries with a diversified footprint in, among others, the financial services, business services, healthcare and manufacturing sectors. No single industry represents more than approximately 21% of overall FA revenues. In addition, no single client comprised more than 5% of overall Firm revenues. Revenue for our FA business decreased 11.4% to $306.0 million in 2021 on a year-over-year basis primarily due to a decrease in revenues from certain contracts we secured in the second quarter of 2020 to support government-sponsored COVID-19 related initiatives (the “COVID-19 Business”). These contracts contributed $71.0 million and $114.7 million in revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the contribution of revenue from our COVID-19 Business, our FA business would have increased approximately 1% on a year-over-year basis. The average bill rate in FA in 2021, excluding the COVID-19 Business, was approximately $38 per hour, which increased 1.0% as compared to 2020. This increase is primarily a result of the mix of business towards more highly skilled assignments as a result of our repositioning efforts.
The September 2021 report published by SIA stated that finance and accounting temporary staffing is expected to experience growth of 16% and 7%, respectively, in 2021 and 2022. 
Our Consultants
The vast majority of our consultants are directly employed by Kforce, including domestic and foreign workers sponsored by Kforce, with a smaller number being qualified independent contractors. As the employer of the vast majority of our consultants, Kforce is responsible for the employer’s share of applicable social security taxes (“FICA”), federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other direct labor costs. The more pertinent health, welfare and retirement benefits include comprehensive health insurance, workers’ compensation benefits, and retirement plan options. A key ingredient to our overall success is to foster a positive experience for our consultants, which has a direct correlation to consultant retention and redeployment. 
We measure the quality of our service to and support of our consultants using staffing industry benchmarks and net promoter score (“NPS”) surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our consultant and client NPS ratings are well above staffing industry averages and have reached World-Class level as defined by the independent third-party provider. Additionally, we continually seek direct feedback from our consultants, which helps us identify opportunities to refine our services.
In a recent study conducted by SIA, Kforce was ranked as the #1 most recognized brand by information technology consultants. 
Industry Overview
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Within the professional staffing industry, it is made up of thousands of companies, most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base. A report published by SIA in 2021 indicated that, in the United States, Kforce is one of the largest publicly-traded specialty staffing firms, the sixth largest technology temporary staffing firm and the third largest finance and accounting temporary staffing firm.
From an economic standpoint, temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand, based on data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and SIA. In December 2021, the penetration rate (the percentage of temporary staffing to total employment) remained flat at 1.9% compared to 2020, while the unemployment rate, at 3.9%, was down from 6.7% in December 2020. In addition, the college-level unemployment rate, which we believe serves as a better proxy for professional employment and therefore aligns well with the consultant and candidate population that Kforce most typically serves, was 2.1% in December 2021, which represented a substantial decrease from December 2020. Further, we believe that the unemployment rate in the specialties we serve, especially in certain technology skill sets, is significantly lower than the published averages. We believe this speaks to the overall secular drivers of demand in technology, the critical nature of the technology initiatives being driven by our clients, as well as the challenges of finding an adequate supply of qualified talent. 
According to the September 2021 SIA report, the technology temporary staffing industry and finance and accounting temporary staffing industry are expected to generate projected revenues of $35.9 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, in 2022. Based on these projected revenues, our current market share is approximately 3%. Our business strategies are focused on expanding our share of the U.S. temporary staffing industry and investing in our capability to provide higher level IT services and solutions. We believe that the organic investments that we have made in our managed teams and project solutions capabilities over the last several years have expanded Kforce’s total addressable market. Published reports indicate that the addressable market in the technology solutions space is well in excess of $100 billion. 
Business Strategies
Our primary objectives are driving long-term shareholder value by achieving above-market revenue growth, making prudent investments to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness within our operating model and significantly improving levels of operating profitability. We believe the following strategies will help us achieve our objectives. 
Evolving our Managed Teams and Project Solutions Offerings. Our clients have increasingly been looking for firms such as Kforce to assume a greater level of responsibility in assisting them with their digital transformation efforts. We believe that the total addressable market in the higher-end IT services and solutions market is significantly larger than the traditional technology staff augmentation market. We believe that the use of firms such as Kforce, which can provide cost effective access to highly skilled talent to manage a team of consultants or oversee technology projects, is a significant driver for this increased demand. We are leveraging the longevity of our relationships, primarily with Fortune 1000 companies, and our understanding of existing client needs to provide talent beyond traditional staff augmentation into areas including resource and capacity management as well as managed services and solutions. As an example, for a large national property and casualty insurance provider, we built a unified customer experience, for both policy holders and agents, across all digital distribution and service channels. The outcome was to simultaneously increase customer acquisition and share of wallet, while driving renewal and retention rates in the current book of business. Our efforts resulted in both the desired outcome and the company winning the J.D. Powers award. Another example involves one of the nation’s largest retail-grocers with over 2,000 stores and 325,000 employees. We are providing strategic, digital and technology transformation services to support the streamlining of their full supply chain model with initial focus on supply chain analysis, data governance and mobile application development. 
Further Improve the Quality of our Revenue Stream. In addition to the significant progress we have made in evolving our managed teams and project solutions offerings, we are also focused on further improving the quality of our revenue stream through the migration of our FA business towards more highly skilled assignments that are less susceptible to technological disruption. Historically, we have supported professional administrative roles such as customer service, data entry, and call center. We do not intend on focusing our efforts on these, among other types of roles, in 2022 and beyond unless there is a strategic client relationship or other strategic rationale.
Reimagining a More Flexible Work Environment. The results of multiple employee surveys conducted over the last 18 to almost 24 months indicate that our associates have embraced the ingenuity required to work remotely and have been successful in settling into new, productive routines. We continue to make substantial progress in our “Kforce Reimagined” initiative, which is an effort to position Kforce to provide a more flexible hybrid work environment for our associates that was initiated shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are referring to this new era of Kforce’s work environment as “Office Occasional.” In this new era, our employees will have maximum flexibility and choice in designing their workdays. This approach is rooted in trust and is supported by integrated technology aligned with our evolved operating model. We will have a remote-first approach but encourage our employees to leverage physical office space, when desirable, for activities that are most efficiently done through in-person, active collaboration. 
In support of this strategic shift, following the sale of our corporate headquarters campus in May 2021, we signed a long-term lease for our future corporate headquarters in September 2021, which we anticipate occupying in the fourth quarter of 2022. The design of our new space will be modern, open and technology-enabled and will provide a flexible environment for our employees to work effectively, very similar to how we are approaching the design of our field offices. 
We expect that the culmination of these efforts will position Kforce as a destination for top talent during a time where there is great disruption in the labor markets.
Improving the Productivity of our Talent. We believe that it is critical to provide our associates with high quality tools to effectively and efficiently perform their roles, better evaluate business opportunities and advance the value we bring to our clients and consultants. We continue to enhance our sales and delivery methodologies and processes in ways we believe will allow us to better evaluate and shape business opportunities with our clients as well as train our sales and delivery associates to follow our consistent and uniform methodology.
During 2021, we completed the rollout of the initial capabilities within our new talent relationship management (TRM) system, which we expect will better facilitate our delivery strategies and processes and significantly improve our capabilities. Going forward, we expect to continue to make enhancements to our business and data intelligence capabilities. These investments are part of a multi-year effort to significantly upgrade our technology tools, using cloud-based platforms, to equip our associates with improved capabilities to deliver exceptional service to our clients, consultants and candidates and improve the productivity of our associates and the scalability of our organization.
Critical to improving the performance of our associates is the development of a strong management team. A key pillar of our talent development strategy is to provide our leaders with access to the appropriate training and tools to lead their teams effectively. During 2021, we continued investing in an intensive leadership development curriculum. These activities will be ongoing and, we believe, will lead to enhanced leadership capabilities and, thus, higher retention levels of our associates.
During 2021, we engaged an independent third-party consulting firm to assist us in our assessment of our middle and back office capabilities. The results of the assessment work confirmed our belief that we have a tremendous opportunity to fundamentally transform how our back office supports the Firm. We will continue to make investments in this multi-year transformation effort in 2022.
Enhancing our Client Relationships. We strive to differentiate ourselves by working collaboratively with our clients to better understand their business challenges and help them attain their organizational objectives. This collaboration focuses on building a consultative partnership rather than a transactional client relationship, which increases the intimacy we have with our clients and improves our ability to offer higher value and a broader array of services and support to our clients. To accomplish this, we align our revenue-generating talent with clients based on their experience with markets, products, industries and in the case of a managed teams and solutions offering, expertise in the related technology or project. 
We measure our success in building long-lasting relationships with our clients using staffing industry benchmarks and Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our client NPS ratings are among the highest in the industry and provide helpful insights from our clients on how to continue improving our relationships. We believe long-lasting relationships with our clients is a critical element in revenue growth.
Improving the Job Seeker Experience. Our consultants are a critical component of our business and essential in sustaining our client relationships. In 2021, we were able to utilize our talent community platform through WorkLLama, specifically its referral management capability, to provide us leverage in the timely sourcing of qualified candidates. We believe this seamlessly connects the candidate with the recruiter, which improves the job seeker’s experience and provides a better quality candidate. We are focused on effective and efficient processes and tools to find and attract prospective consultants, matching them to a client assignment and supporting them during their tenure with Kforce. Our success in this regard would be expected to positively influence the tenure and loyalty of our consultants and be their employer of choice, thus enabling us to deliver the highest quality talent to our clients. 
We measure the quality of our service to and support of our consultants using staffing industry benchmarks and NPS surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our consultant NPS ratings, similar to our client ratings, are among the highest in the industry. We continually seek direct feedback from our consultants, which helps us identify opportunities to refine our services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented staffing industry comprised of large national and local staffing and solutions firms. The local firms are typically operator-owned, and each market generally has one or more significant competitors. Within our managed teams and project solutions offerings, we also face competition from global, national and regional accounting, consulting and advisory firms and national and regional strategic consulting and systems implementation firms. We believe that our boundaryless reach within the U.S., physical presence in larger markets, concentration of service offerings in areas of greatest demand (especially technology), national delivery teams, centralized delivery channels for foreign consultants, including those obtained via the H-1B visa program that optimizes distribution and strengthens compliance, longevity of our brand and reputation in the market, along with our dedicated compliance and regulatory infrastructure, all provide a competitive advantage. 
Many clients utilize Managed Service Providers (“MSP”) or Vendor Management Organizations (“VMO”) for the management and procurement of our services. Generally, MSPs and VMOs standardize processes through the use of Vendor Management Systems (“VMS”), which are tools used to aggregate spend and measure supplier performance. VMSs are also offered through 
independent providers. Typically, MSPs, VMOs and/or VMS providers charge staffing firms administrative fees ranging from 1% to 4% of revenue. In addition, the aggregation of services by MSPs for their clients into a single program can result in significant buying power and, thus, pricing power. Therefore, the use of MSPs by our clients has, in certain instances, resulted in margin compression, but has also led to incremental client share through our client’s vendor consolidation efforts. Kforce does not currently provide MSP or VMO services directly to our clients; rather, our strategy has been to work with MSPs, VMOs and VMS providers that enable us to better extend our services to current and prospective clients.
We believe that the principal elements of competition in our industry are differentiated offerings, reputation, ability of consultants to work on assignments with innovative and leading companies, the availability and quality of associates, consultants and candidates, level of service, effective monitoring of job performance, scope of geographic service, types of service offerings and compliance orientation. To attract consultants and candidates, we emphasize our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits, quality and varied assignments, scheduling flexibility and permanent placement opportunities, all of which are important to Kforce being the employer of choice. Because individuals pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis, it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals and focus on our consultant relationship objectives. Additionally, in certain markets, from time to time we have experienced significant pricing pressure as a result of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which may result in us not being able to effectively compete or choosing to not participate in certain business that does not meet our profitability standard.
Regulatory Environment
Staffing and solutions firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulations: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship, such as wage and hour regulations, tax withholding and reporting, immigration/H-1B visa regulations, social security and other retirement, anti-discrimination, employee benefits and workers’ compensation regulations; (2) registration, licensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and (3) worker classification regulations.
Because we operate in a complex regulatory environment, one of our top priorities is compliance. For more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on Kforce’s financial results, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Insurance
Kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, liability for certain foreign exposure, umbrella and excess liability, property, crime, fiduciary, directors and officers, employment practices liability, cybersecurity, professional liability and excess health insurance coverage. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from Kforce’s operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
Human Capital Management and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Matters
Core Values
At the heart of Kforce, as an organization, is a deep understanding of and unwavering commitment to our core values. As we drive toward one shared vision, we refreshed our core values during 2021, to embody our unique perspectives, our dedication to doing what’s right and creating positive social change. Our Core Values are:
•INTEGRITY: Act with intention. Keep promises. Take responsibility.
•EXCELLENCE: Embrace competition. Succeed together. Go for the win.
•COMPASSION: Respect others. Nurture relationships. Spread kindness.
•UNITY: Encourage collaboration. Support each other. Pursue a shared vision.
•ADAPTABILITY: Champion innovation. Stay curious. Consider the uncommon.
•COURAGE: Dare to fail. Speak openly. Dream big.
•FUN: Be yourself. Laugh often. Enjoy the journey.
Commitment to Values and Ethics through Governance
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for associates to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting violations. Our associates receive training on our Code of Conduct and must acknowledge their understanding and certify compliance annually. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline). Our executive officers and leaders maintain “open door” policies and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. We take all reports of suspected violations and unethical behavior seriously and take appropriate actions to immediately address such situations.
Employees and Personnel
As of December 31, 2021, Kforce employed approximately 2,000 associates, including roughly 1,300 supporting the revenue-generating aspects of our business and approximately 700 supporting the revenue-enabling aspects. We also had approximately 11,000 consultants on assignment with our clients with more than 80% of these consultants employed directly by Kforce. As the employer, Kforce is responsible for the employer’s share of applicable social security taxes (“FICA”), federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other direct labor costs relating to our employees. The more pertinent health, welfare and retirement benefits provided to employees and consultants employed directly by us include: 
comprehensive health insurance, workers’ compensation benefits and retirement plan options. Additionally for our associates and certain consultants, we provide paid leave. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption, and are unaware of any current efforts or plans of our employees to organize.
Health and Well-Being
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees and consultants. Accordingly, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and consultants and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. Some of these programs are part of our thoughtful and comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as those that support the physical and mental health of our employees by providing tools and resources that each employee can use to improve or maintain their health. The measures that we have undertaken include: requiring our associates to work remotely since March 2020; maintaining regular communications from our executives regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; enhancing our health and wellness offerings to include a digital self-care platform to help our associates with any mental health concerns; investing in technologies and tools to improve the effectiveness of our associates while working remotely; and improving our associate outreach efforts to detect and try to address any challenges or needs of our associates.
We believe that our future “Office Occasional” work environment has provided our associates maximum flexibility and choice in designing their workdays; thus, additionally contributing to their health and well-being. Consistent with our management philosophy at Kforce, this was anything but a top-down initiative. Rather, this was driven by our associates and has proven to be successful because we empowered our team with a strong voice by conducting continuous pulse checks, surveys, town hall sessions and other collaborative voice of the associate avenues. Our future work environment is rooted in trust and is supported by integrated technology aligned with our evolved operating model.
Talent Management and Leadership Development
Wherever possible, we strive to identify, train and develop talent from within to help ensure that we maintain a consistent operating model, proactive planning, and employee engagement. A core objective is to sustain our current leadership development activities through further advanced training and comprehensive certification for new leaders. Given our goal is to be a destination employer for top talent, we are also focused on efficiently onboarding new associates into our Firm. We are leaning heavily into remote leadership tools and techniques as well as concepts centered on making lasting connections based on trust, compassion and empathy. This approach has yielded an understanding that the Kforce culture and leaders will put safety, wellness and family first.
Among our key initiatives has been our: 
•Leadership Development Program, led by an independent third-party specialist, which is aimed at building the skills necessary to nurture strong relationships, maintain accountability and enhance productivity among all leadership categories in the Firm;
•Engagement with an independent organizational psychologist to facilitate 360 degree assessments for our executive leadership team;
•Several multi-day leadership conferences supported by Kforce leaders and supplemented by online tools and resource libraries; and
•Inclusive leadership training.
Our talent management activities also include, but are not limited to, conducting the following activities:
•Periodic performance appraisals to promote engaging and productive communications between leaders and their team members about performance, career progression and advancement opportunities;
•Calibration sessions during the performance appraisal process to help ensure consistency in assigning appraisal ratings; 
•Comprehensive internal talent pipeline (performance/potential) to assess opportunities for our talent across the Firm and for succession planning purposes; and 
•Goal setting and development discussions using a consistent template to ensure our leaders and associates are aligned on career and development goals, as well as opportunities for growth and improvement.
Kforce has continued to conduct check-in surveys during the pandemic to monitor wellness and enablement of our associate population. To take that even further, we will be investing more comprehensively into the full employee experience as our office occasional work environment continues to take shape. We have purchased software to run employee lifecycle surveying throughout the Kforce employee experience. A key objective will be to use employee data and sentiment to proactively address engagement indicators.
Upcoming activities include, but are not limited to:
•Full-scale employee engagement dashboard;
•Automated exit surveys;
•Lifecycle (stay) interviews;
•Employee engagement surveys; and
•Pulse surveying, as needed.
Information gathered from these upcoming activities will be useful to Kforce management, and to the extent relevant to our Board of Directors’ oversight responsibilities, in developing future goals and objectives pertaining to our talent management strategies. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Program
Kforce’s diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) program has the mission of leveraging our core values and culture in further promoting an authentic culture of diversity, equity and inclusion at Kforce.
In 2021, Kforce advanced its objectives around building an increasingly robust pipeline of diverse candidates, enhancing our supplier diversity practices, and instituting training programs to meet the mission and objectives of our DE&I program. An objective in 2022 is to launch internal “listening sessions,” which will be completed by an external expert to collect and analyze details on associates’ sentiment regarding inclusion and belonging. Information gathered during this process will greatly influence our programming decisions moving forward.
Our other DE&I activities also include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Reviewing third-party analysis of internal demographics, progression and pay-equity practices and studies;
•The creation of an internal DE&I Council;
•Initiating a program to improve pipeline by leveraging geo-base tracking, digital canvasing, job board aggregators and niche partnerships with diverse organizations;
•Publishing an internal DE&I Resource Center (Website);
•Consistently conducting ongoing cultural celebrations; and
•Execution of an ongoing DE&I learning journey for our associates that includes programs such as emotional intelligence and unconscious bias modules.
Our commitment to DE&I goes beyond our partnerships and our Firm. From speaking engagements to career fairs to the charities we support, we actively participate in communities nationwide with a goal of doing our part in building a better tomorrow for the workforce today.
Environmental
As a domestic talent solutions provider, Kforce does not produce or manufacture any products or materials and therefore our direct impact on the environment is relatively small. In addition, we are in the early stages of considering what risks and opportunities climate change may present to our business more broadly. 
Notwithstanding our relatively nominal direct environmental impact, we are dedicated to promoting internal operational sustainability initiatives and keeping our ecological footprint to a minimum. As such, we were able to take advantage of more impactful opportunities using actions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, all of our employees have been working remotely. In addition, the “office occasional” work environment that we have defined for Kforce requires significantly less square footage and less commuting than our pre-pandemic work environment, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint. As noted previously, we have already reduced the number of physical offices from 51 (leased and owned) pre-pandemic to 36 leased offices currently. The reduction in the number of our offices and migration of our offices to our office occasional environment is expected to reduce our overall square footage to be at least 60% to 70% lower than pre-pandemic levels. These actions, which we expect to continue even after the pandemic has subsided, have dramatically reduced the environmental impact of employees’ commutes and the consumption of energy; thereby, decreasing our carbon footprint. We have also been able to reduce certain business travel by using virtual and collaborative tools whenever possible, further limiting our ecological impact. Kforce is committed to enhancing its environmental protection measures and continuing to promote an eco-friendly culture both internally and in the communities it serves.
