Item 1. Business
Each of the terms “Altus,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms used herein refer collectively to Altus Power Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
Company Overview
Our mission is to create a clean electrification ecosystem, to drive the clean energy transition of our customers across the United States while simultaneously enabling the adoption of corporate environmental, social and governance, or ESG, targets. In order to achieve our mission, we develop, own and operate solar generation and energy storage facilities. We have the in-house expertise to develop, build and provide operations and maintenance and customer servicing for our assets. The strength of our platform is enabled by premier sponsorship from The Blackstone Group ("Blackstone"), which provides an efficient capital source and access to a network of portfolio companies, and CBRE Group, Inc. ("CBRE"), which provides direct access to their portfolio of owned and managed commercial and industrial (“C&I”) properties.
We are a developer, owner and operator of large-scale roof, ground and carport-based photovoltaic ("PV") and energy storage systems, serving commercial and industrial, public sector and community solar customers. We own systems across the United States from Hawaii to Vermont. Our portfolio consists of over 350 megawatts (“MW”) of solar PV. We have long-term power purchase agreements ("PPAs") with over 300 C&I entities and contracts with over 5,000 residential customers through community solar projects. We also participate in numerous renewable energy certificate (“REC”) programs throughout the country. We have experienced significant growth in the last 12 months as a product of organic growth and targeted acquisitions and currently operate in 18 states, providing clean electricity to our customers equal to the consumption of approximately 30,000 homes, displacing 255,000 tons of CO2 emissions per annum.
Through our strategic capital deployment, we are able to build and operate clean energy systems on commercial properties, schools and municipal buildings. The electricity we generate helps customers to reduce electricity bills, progress towards decarbonization targets and support resource management needs throughout the asset lifecycles. Our primary product offering is entering into leases or easements with building or landowners and revenue contracts to sell the power generated by the solar energy system to a various commercial, utility, municipal and community solar off takers. In addition to sale of clean power, we also addressing our customer's needs through EV charging and energy storage offerings.
Our offering provides multiple advantages to our customers relative to the status quo:
•Lower electricity bills. Our streamlined process allows for solar energy credits to get directly applied to customer’s utility bill, which allows them to realize immediate savings. In addition, our PPAs are typically priced to include a day one savings as compared to the existing utility rates.
•Increase accessibility of clean electricity. Through our use of community solar we are able to provide clean electricity to customers who otherwise would not have been able to construct on-site solar (e.g. apartment and condominium customers). This increases the total addressable market and enables energy security for all.
•Supporting clean energy ecosystem. Demand for clean sources of electricity is anticipated to only increase. We strive to support our customers in their continued transition to the clean energy ecosystem through our solar PV and storage systems as well as our EV charging stations. We expect our continued growth and expansion of product offerings will allow us to support even more customers in this transition.
We own all of our solar systems, which we build and install, with equipment sourced from a wide variety of suppliers. We purchase all major components of the systems we construct, including solar modules, inverters, racking systems, transformers, medium voltage equipment, monitoring equipment and balance of system equipment. All of the labor for the construction of these systems is subcontracted under Altus’s standard contracts. 
We believe our robust and actionable pipeline is the result of our deep network of developers and channel partners with local expertise, which is beneficial in the many markets where we are active. Our wholly-owned in-house construction company provides expertise in asset development that aids the success of our pipeline projects. Further, we believe that our ability to source deals, our strategic asset financing structure, combined with the demand for clean energy provide us with a competitive advantage and a unique position in the solar power industry.
Merger with CBRE Acquisition Holdings, Inc. ("CBAH")
On December 9, 2021 (the "Closing Date"), CBRE Acquisition Holdings, Inc. ("CBAH"), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the business combination pursuant to the terms of the business combination agreement entered into on July 12, 2021 (the "Business Combination Agreement"), whereby, among other things, CBAH Merger Sub I, Inc. ("First Merger Sub") merged with and into Altus Power, Inc. (f/k/a Altus Power America, Inc.) ("Legacy Altus") with Legacy Altus continuing as the surviving corporation, and immediately thereafter Legacy Altus merged with and into CBAH Merger Sub II, Inc. ("Second 
Merger Sub") with Second Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of CBAH (together with the merger with the First Merger sub, the “Merger”).
Our predecessor, CBAH, a blank check company, was established as a special purpose acquisition company, which completed its initial public offering on December 15, 2020. CBAH was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, and, prior to the Merger, the Company was a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because it had no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. In connection with the Closing, CBAH changed its name to “Altus Power, Inc.” Prior to the Closing, CBAH’s SAILSM (Stakeholder Aligned Initial Listing) securities, shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock”) and CBAH’s public warrants (“Redeemable Warrants” or “Public Warrants”) were listed on the NYSE under the symbols “CBAH.U”, “CBAH” and “CBAH WS”, respectively. Following the Closing, we continued the listing of the Class A common stock and Public Warrants on the NYSE under the symbols “AMPS” and “AMPS WS”, respectively.
Total Addressable Market
Electricity demand has been evolving for many years, but the evolution has accelerated with the renewable targets and decarbonization goals established by many corporations demanding a transition to clean electricity generation. The demand is coming from multiple industry segments including the public sector, the private sector and the residential customers. Historically the C&I market has been under-penetrated by traditional utility-scale solar PV providers due to the smaller scale of projects and difficulties associated with scaling nationally. We believe we are well equipped to drive the C&I growth segment of the solar PV market through our existing national partner footprint, efficient acquisition and deployment strategies and standardized approach to customer contracts and asset financing.
We believe the confluence of multiple clean energy trends creates a significant market opportunity. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the U.S. spends $400 billion on electricity each year, of which $200 billion is spent on C&I. An additional $98 billion of investment will be required to meet the U.S.’s 2030 sustainability goals. Further, C&I customers are projected to spend over $6 trillion on electricity between now and 2050. 
We believe it will be necessary to rapidly increase the scale and scope of renewable generation assets in the U.S. in order to meet the various targets and commitments set by corporations and governments and that through our strategic partnerships and market-leading financing, Altus is well equipped to help meet this demand and lead in the clean energy transition.
Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership
Altus Power was founded to address the urgent need to transform the way we generate and consume power. Our mission – to create a clean electrification ecosystem that can provide renewable energy to every business, home and electric vehicle – is intrinsically linked to clean, renewable power as the foundation for a sustainable future. 
We believe that leadership in environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices is central to accomplishing our mission, so we continue to take steps to address the environmental and social risks of our operations and products. To this end, we have established a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee that is dedicated to implementing and improving upon already existing sustainability practices throughout our company. Our team is passionate about empowering communities and businesses to accelerate the global energy transition while also doing everything we can to foster a diverse, inclusive and innovative corporate culture at Altus Power. 
Our sustainability efforts will be organized into the three ESG pillars: Environment, Social, and Governance. We plan to report how we oversee and manage ESG factors in an annual sustainability report. In this report we plan to follow the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. 
•Our Environment Pillar will focus on providing clean, affordable energy to our customers; maintaining a robust environmental management program that ensures we protect the environment in the communities where we operate and build; and helping to make our energy infrastructure more resilient and sustainable. 
•Our Social Pillar will focus on attracting and retaining a team of talented individuals, while offering opportunities for growth and development; building a diverse and inclusive work force; and ensuring a safety-first workplace for our employees through proper training, policies and protocols.
•Our Governance Pillar will focus on ensuring Board oversight and committee ownership of our enterprise risk management and sustaining a commitment to ethical business conduct, transparency, honesty, and integrity. We strive to support ethically sourced products and materials and encourage the partners in our supply-chain to abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
All of our actions and each of our ESG pillars are underpinned by the goal of driving the clean energy transition of our customers across the United States.
Our Digital Platform
Altus Power leverages best in class enterprise software solutions to manage our operation as well as a series of proprietary capture and management tools. We leverage this suite of tools and interfaces to create value for customers with asset performance tracking, analytics, real time data generation and meet our forecast objectives. Altus is in the process of developing our next generation proprietary software stack to support our growth and increase our efficiency with digital tools that will enable our platforms to have full integration into our B2B and B2C lifecycles from origination through maintenance. Our production data sources ensure solar systems maximize performance and meet baseline forecasts as well as asset registration and customer data management. We warehouse our technology and project data, contracts and customer records and have the alert and monitoring systems developed to ensure we have maximum uptime.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solar energy offerings through a scalable sales organization using a national developer base with local expertise, intermediaries that connect clients directly to Altus as well as our diverse partner network. We also generate sales volume through client referrals. Client referrals increase in relation to our penetration in a market and shortly after market entry become an increasingly effective way to market our solar energy systems. We believe that a customized, relationship-focused selling process is important before, during and after the sale of our solar services to maximize our sales success and customer experience and to generate relationships with developers that lead to repeat projects. We train our sales and marketing team in house to maximize this multi-pronged client development strategy.
Supply Chain
We purchase equipment, including solar panels, inverters and batteries from a variety of manufacturers and suppliers. If one or more of the suppliers and manufacturers that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand reduces or ceases production, it may be difficult to quickly identify and qualify alternatives on acceptable terms. In addition, equipment prices may increase in the coming years, or not decrease at the rates we historically have experienced, due to tariffs or other factors. For further information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We have filed trademark applications for “Altus” and the Altus logo, application numbers 90/730,855 and 90/731,002, respectively. Altus has registered domain names, including www.altuspower.com. Information contained on or accessible through the website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the inclusion of the website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an inactive textual reference only. Altus does not currently have any issued patents. Altus intends to file patent applications as we continue to innovate through our research and development efforts.
Regulatory
Although we are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business, we compete primarily with regulated utilities. As a result, we have developed and are committed to maintaining a policy team to focus on the key regulatory and legislative issues impacting the entire industry. We believe these efforts help us better navigate local markets through relationships with key stakeholders and facilitate a deep understanding of the national and regional policy environment.
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility directly to us and/or our customers. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering policies. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We endeavor to maintain compliance with applicable OSHA and other comparable government regulations.
Government Incentives
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, payments for RECs associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers for energy from, and to lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of 
solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power. In addition, for some investors, the acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
The federal government currently offers an investment tax credit (“ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), for the installation of certain solar power facilities owned for business purposes. If construction on the facility began before January 1, 2020, the amount of the ITC available is 30%, if construction began during 2020, 2021, or 2022 the amount of the ITC available is 26%, and if construction begins during 2023 the amount of the ITC available is 22%. The ITC steps down to 10% if construction of the facility begins after December 31, 2023 or if the facility is not placed in service before January 1, 2026. The depreciable basis of a solar facility is also reduced by 50% of the amount of any ITC claimed. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) provided taxpayers guidance in Notice 2018-59 for determining when construction has begun on a solar facility. This guidance is relevant for any facilities which we seek to deploy in future years but take advantage of a higher tax credit rate available for an earlier year. For example, we have sought to avail ourselves of the methods set forth in the guidance to retain the 30% ITC that was available prior to January 1, 2020 by incurring certain costs and taking title to equipment in 2019 or early 2020 and/or by performing physical work on components that will be installed in solar facilities. From and after 2023, we may seek to avail ourselves of the 26% credit rate by using these methods to establish the beginning of construction in 2021, or 2022 and we may plan to similarly further utilize the program in future years if the ITC step down continues.
President Biden’s administration has put forth various legislation, which if passed, is anticipated to include a stand-alone battery storage ITC, EV and EV charging infrastructure tax incentives and further solar ITC extension. These policy tailwinds serve to further support market expansion of clean energy and electrification. Nevertheless, we believe we are already competitive without government subsidies, with levelized cost of energy for solar reaching attractive rates as compared to traditional generation.
In additional to the incentives at the federal government, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Approximately thirty states and the District of Columbia have adopted a renewable portfolio standard (and approximately eight other states have some voluntary goal) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must surrender solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) to the applicable authority. Solar energy system owners such as our investment funds often are able to sell SRECs to utilities directly or in SREC markets. While there are numerous federal, state and local government incentives that benefit our business, some adverse interpretations or determinations of new and existing laws can have a negative impact on our business.
