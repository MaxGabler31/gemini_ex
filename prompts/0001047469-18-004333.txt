   Recent Developments 
   ClearAg, Inc. 
         In April 2017, Iteris, Inc. formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, ClearAg, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to provide ClearAg solutions in the agribusiness markets. 
   Products and Services 
         We currently operate in three reportable segments: Roadway Sensors, Transportation Systems, and Agriculture and Weather Analytics. 
         The Roadway Sensors segment provides various advanced detection sensors and systems for traffic intersection management, communication systems and roadway traffic data collection applications. The Transportation Systems segment provides engineering and consulting services, performance measurement, regulatory compliance, and traffic analytics solutions, as well as the development of traveler information systems for the ITS industry. The Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment includes ClearPath Weather, our road maintenance applications, and ClearAg, our digital agriculture platform. 
         See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for further details on our reportable segments. 
 


Roadway Sensors 

         Our Roadway Sensors segment product line uses advanced image and signal processing technology and other techniques to capture and analyze sensor data through sophisticated algorithms, enabling vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian detection, as well as the transmission of both video images and data using various communication technologies. Our Roadway Sensors products include, among others, Vantage, VantageLive!, VantageNext, VantageRadius, VantagePegasus, Vantage Vector, Velocity, SmartCycle, SmartCycle Bike Indicator, SmartSpan, VersiCam, PedTrax and P-Series products. 
 

 Our Vantage detection systems detect vehicle presence at intersections, as well as vehicle count, speed and other traffic data used in traffic
management systems. Vantage detection systems typically include up to four of our advanced cameras or radar devices. Our Vantage systems give traffic managers the tools to mitigate roadway congestion
by visualizing and analyzing traffic patterns allowing them to modify traffic signal timing to improve traffic flow. Our various software components complement our Vantage detection systems by
providing integrated platforms to manage and view detection assets remotely over a network connection, as well as mobile application for viewing anywhere. 
 Our Vantage Vector video/radar hybrid product is an all-in-one detection sensor with a wide range of capabilities, including stop bar and
advanced zone detection, which enable advanced safety and adaptive control applications. Vantage Vector includes all of the benefits of Iteris video detection, including high accuracy,
high-availability remote viewing of video images, bicycle and pedestrian detection capability, and dilemma-zone detection.

 VantageLive! is a cloud-based platform that allows users to collect, process and analyze advanced intersection data, as well as to view and
understand intersection activity. 
 All of our Vantage systems are available with SmartCycle capability, which can effectively differentiate between bicycles and other vehicles
with a single video detection camera, enabling more efficient signalized intersections, improved traffic throughput and increased bicyclist safety. Agencies using bicycle timing can now benefit from
bicycle-specific virtual detection zones that can be placed anywhere within the approaching traffic lanes, eliminating the need for separate bicycle-only detection systems. 
 The SmartCycle Bike Indicator, which leverages the SmartCycle bicycle detection algorithm, is a device that mounts onto traffic signals and
illuminates when cyclists waiting at an intersection have been detected, allowing cyclists to avoid interacting with vehicle traffic to push pole-mounted buttons. 
 Our Vantage systems are also available with the PedTrax capability, which provides bi-directional counting and speed tracking of pedestrians
within the crosswalk to help improve signal timing efficiency, as well as providing an additional data stream to existing vehicle and bicycle counts. 
 VersiCam, our integrated camera and processor video detection system, is a cost-efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that
require only a few detection points. 

         We believe that future growth domestically and internationally, will be dependent in part on the continued adoption of above-ground video detection technologies, instead of traditional in-pavement loop technology, to manage traffic. 
         We also sell certain complementary original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products for the traffic intersection market, which include, among other things, traffic signal controllers and traffic signal equipment cabinets. 
 


Transportation Systems 

         Our Transportation Systems segment includes engineering and consulting services focused on the planning, design, development and implementation of software and hardware-based ITS systems that integrate sensors, video surveillance, computers and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor, control and direct traffic flow, assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews, and distribute real-time information about traffic conditions. Our services include planning, design, implementation, operation and management of surface transportation infrastructure systems. We perform analysis and study goods movement, commercial vehicle operations, provide travel demand forecasting and systems engineering, and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion. 
         The Transportations Systems segment also includes our performance measurement and management solution, iPeMSa state-of-the-art information management software suite that provides prescriptive data insights to help determine current and future traffic patterns, permitting the effective performance analysis and management of traffic infrastructure resources. iPeMS utilizes a wide range of data resources and analytical techniques to determine current and future traffic patterns, permitting the effective performance analysis and management of traffic infrastructure resources. This information can then be analyzed by traffic professionals to measure how a transportation network is performing and to identify potential areas of improvement. iPeMS is also capable of providing users with predictive traffic analytics, and easy-to-use visualization and animation features based on historical traffic conditions. 
         This segment also includes our commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance platforms, known as "CVIEW-Plus," "CheckPoint," "UCRLink" and "inspect."

           Our Transportation Systems segment is largely dependent upon state and local governmental funding, and to a lesser extent federal governmental funding. As such, our Transportation Systems business has been adversely affected by governmental budgetary issues. In addition, various other funding mechanisms exist to support transportation infrastructure and related projects, including, but not limited to, bonds, dedicated sales and gas tax measures, and other alternative funding sources. We believe the overall expansion of our Transportation Systems segment in the future will continue to be dependent at least in part on the federal and local government's use of funds. Delays in the allocation of funds may prolong uncertainty regarding the allotment of transportation funds in federal, state and local budgets. 
 


Agriculture and Weather Analytics 

         Our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment, which we formed during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, consists of our ClearPath Weather and Clear Ag solutions. 
         Our ClearPath Weather is a web-based system that has a suite of tools that enable users to assess historical weather conditions and analyze short-term and long-range weather forecasts, to customize route/site weather and pavement forecast tools, which provide winter road maintenance recommendations for state agencies, municipalities and enable commercial companies to create solutions for the management of roadway maintenance. 
         Our Weather Analytics business is a market leader in performance management solutions for federal and state organizations. We intend to use our strong brand and deep experience in the traffic management market, as well as our market-specific intellectual property, to expand our leadership in data aggregation and analytics in this market. 
         Beginning in late 2013, we undertook the development of "ClearAg solutions" for the digital agricultural market. These new products utilize and expand the intellectual property, technology base and product suites of our ClearPath Weather solutions. For our ClearAg solutions, we developed additional scientific and agronomic models and forecasts, expanded our computing infrastructure for additional big data acquisition and processing, and designed distributed delivery vehicles and products. 
         Our ClearAg solutions combine weather and agronomic data with proprietary land-surface modeling and analytics to solve complex agricultural problems, which results in the increased efficiency and sustainability of farmlands. The ClearAg Platform delivers product validation, irrigation and harvest solutions giving growers, researchers and other agribusinesses access to a comprehensive database of historical, real-time and forecasted weather, soil and plant health information, as well as other information on crop growth. Companies use the ClearAg Platform to simulate field conditions and determine how new products may perform on a crop given certain weather and soil conditions. Growers leverage the ClearAg Platform to determine the best times to plant, spray, fertilize, irrigate, and harvest crops. 
         We currently offer our ClearAg solutions on an enterprise basis combining our modeling solutions with ClearAg application programming interfaces ("APIs"). These APIs facilitate the integration of ClearAg's analytics and insights with the offerings of large enterprise customers in the agriculture market. We commenced commercial sales of the ClearAg solutions and related APIs in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 ("Fiscal 2015"). We also developed the ClearAg WeatherPlot and ClearAg Insights applications, which provide analytics on forecasted historical weather, water and soil temperatures to help agronomists and crop consultants identify and make recommendations for treatments at ideal environmental conditions to maximize crop quality and yield. 
         We expect market acceptance of our ClearAg solutions to continue to increase in upcoming quarters. We plan to continue to fund the investments in our ClearAg solutions, through cash flow generated from our Roadway Sensors and Transportation Systems operations, revenues from our 
 6

   Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment, and our available cash on hand, as needed. We may also elect to raise additional equity for these investments. 
   Sales and Marketing 
         We currently sell our Roadway Sensors products through both direct and indirect sales channels. In the territories where we sell direct, we use a combination of our own sales personnel and outside sales organizations to sell, oversee installations and set-up issues, and support our products. Our indirect sales channel is comprised of a network of independent distributors in the U.S. and select international locations, which sell integrated systems and related products to the traffic management market. In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 ("Fiscal 2018"), we entered into a distribution agreement to expand our northern European sales coverage in the U.K. and Ireland. Our independent distributors are trained in, and primarily responsible for, sales, installation, set-up and support of our products, maintain an inventory of demonstration traffic products from various manufacturers, and sell directly to government agencies and installation contractors. These distributors often have long-term arrangements with local government agencies in their respective territories for the supply of various products for the construction and renovation of traffic intersections, and are generally well-known suppliers of various high-quality ITS products to the traffic management market. We periodically hold technical training classes for our distributors and end users, and maintain a full-time staff of customer support technicians throughout the U.S. to provide technical assistance when needed. When appropriate, we have the ability to modify or make changes to our distributor network to accommodate the needs of the market and our customer base. 
         We market and sell our Transportation Systems services and solutions, and our ClearPath Weather services primarily to government agencies pursuant to negotiated contracts that involve competitive bidding and specific qualification requirements. Most of our contracts are with federal, state and local municipal customers, and generally provide for cancellation or renegotiation at the option of the customer upon reasonable notice and fees paid for modification. We generally use selected members of our engineering, science and information technology teams on a regional basis to serve in sales and business development functions. Our Transportation Systems contracts generally involve long lead times and require extensive specification development, evaluation and price negotiations. 
         We currently market and sell our ClearAg solutions as a subscription-based service to seed and crop protection companies, allied providers and agriculture integrators, as well as to growers and retailers. Due to the recent consolidation of certain large companies in the agriculture market, sales to such companies typically involve long lead times. We generally sell directly to customers interested in the ClearAg API products, but typically sell through selling partners for our ClearAg applications. Mobile versions of WeatherPlot are currently available in the Apple app store and on Google Play. 
         We have historically had a diverse customer base. For Fiscal 2018, one individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 ("Fiscal 2017"), one individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. 
   Manufacturing and Materials 
         We use contract manufacturers to build subassemblies that are used in our Roadway Sensors products. Additionally, we procure certain components for our Roadway Sensors products from qualified suppliers, both in the U.S. and internationally, and generally use multi-sourcing strategies when technically and economically feasible to mitigate supply risk. These subassemblies and components are typically delivered to our Santa Ana, California facility, where they go through final assembly and testing prior to shipment to our customers. Our key suppliers include Veris Manufacturing, MoboTrex, Inc. and Sony Electronics, Inc. Our manufacturing activities are conducted in approximately 9,000 square feet of space at our Santa Ana, California facility. Production volume at 
 7

   our subcontractors is based upon quarterly forecasts that we generally adjust on a monthly basis to control inventory levels. We typically do not manufacture any of the hardware used in the transportation management and traveler information systems that we design and implement. Our production facility is currently ISO 9001 certified. 
   Customer Support and Services 
         We provide warranty service and support for our products, as well as follow-up service and support for which we charge separately. Such service revenue was not a material portion of our total revenues for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 ("Fiscal 2016"). We believe customer support is a key competitive factor for our company. 
         Our ClearAg solutions are primarily sold as annual subscription services with recurring monthly revenue. As an element of these services, we provide full-time support and customer service for such ClearAg solutions. 
   Backlog 
         Our total backlog of unfulfilled firm orders was approximately $47.5 million as of March 31, 2018, which included $37.7 million related to Transportation Systems. We typically recognize approximately 70% of our Transportation Systems backlog as of the end of a fiscal year in the subsequent fiscal year, and currently expect that trend to continue for the near future for both Transportation Systems and Agriculture and Weather Analytics. Substantially the entire backlog for Roadway Sensors as of March 31, 2018 is expected to be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2017, we had backlog of approximately $64.5 million, which included $54.4 million related to Transportation Systems. The decline in backlog in the current fiscal year was largely due to the completion of a large Transportation Systems contract in the current fiscal year. 
         The timing and realization of our backlog is subject to the inherent uncertainties of doing business with federal, state and local governments, particularly in view of budgetary constraints, cut-backs and other delays or reallocations of funding that these entities typically face. In addition, pursuant to the customary terms of our agreements with government contractors and other customers, our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalties. Lead times for the release of purchase orders often depend upon the scheduling and forecasting practices of our individual customers, which also can affect the timing of the conversion of our backlog into revenues. For these reasons, among others, our backlog at a particular date may not be indicative of our future revenues, in particular for our Roadway Sensors segment. 
   Product Development 
         Our product development activities are mostly conducted at our Agriculture and Weather Analytics facilities in Grand Forks, North Dakota and Oakland, California, as well as at our principal facility in Santa Ana, California. Our research and development costs and expenses were approximately $7.9 million for Fiscal 2018 and $6.9 million for both Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016. We expect to continue to pursue various product development programs and incur research and development expenditures, primarily in our Agriculture and Weather Analytics and Roadway Sensors segments, in future periods. 
         We believe our engineering and product development capabilities are a competitive strength. We strive to continuously develop new products, technologies, features and functionalities to meet the needs of our ever-changing markets, as well as to enhance, improve upon, and refine our existing product lines. We plan to focus our development efforts in the near future in our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment on our ClearAg solutions and to developing further enhancements and functionality in our Vantage products family. We believe that developing new and enhanced product 
 8

   offerings across our segments and enhancing, refining and marketing our existing products are key components for strong organic growth and profitability. 
   Competition 
         We generally face significant competition in each of our target markets. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         The markets in which our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment operates vary from the commercial sector customers for ClearAg solutions to public sector customers for ClearPath Weather solutions. Our competitors vary in number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. In the public sector, we compete with some of the same transportation engineering, planning and design firms that also compete with our Transportation Systems segment. In the commercial sector, we compete with a variety of entities that currently provide weather-related data to that market, such as IBM/The Weather Company, MeteoGroup and agronomic analytics companies such as FBN and Farmer's Edge. 
         In the market for our Roadway Sensors detection products, we compete with manufacturers and distributors of other above-ground video camera detection systems such as Econolite, and manufacturers and distributors of other non-intrusive detection devices, including microwave, infrared, radar, ultrasonic and magnetic detectors, as well as manufacturers and installers of in-pavement inductive loop products, which have historically been, and currently continue to be, the predominant vehicle detection system in this market. Additionally, products such as Velocity and VantagePegasus compete against various competitors in the travel-time and data communications markets, respectively. 
         The markets in which our Transportation Systems segment operate are highly fragmented and subject to evolving national and regional quality, operations and safety standards. Our competitors vary in number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Our competitors in advanced transportation systems include large, national corporations that generally offer expertise in traveler information, integration and transportation management. Our competitors in transportation engineering, planning and design include major regional ITS engineering firms, as well as many smaller local engineering firms. 
         In general, the markets for the products and services we offer are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. Many of our current and prospective competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than us. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging standards or technologies, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. It is also possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We believe that our ability to compete effectively in our target markets will depend on a number of factors, including the success and timing of our new product development, the compatibility of our products with a broad range of computing systems, product quality and performance, reliability, functionality, price and service, and technical support. Our failure to provide services and develop and market products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers and consultants in our target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
         Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology. Our policy is to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for any potentially significant new technology acquired or developed by us. We currently have a total of 
 9

   40 issued U.S. patents, including: (i) 10 relating to our Roadway Sensors technologies, one of which was issued in Fiscal 2018, (ii) 23 relating to our Agriculture and Weather Analytics technologies, six of which were issued in Fiscal 2018, and (iii) seven relating specifically to our Transportation Systems technologies, one of which was issued in Fiscal 2018. We have a total of 22 pending patent applications in the U.S. and 15 pending foreign patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2026 to 2037. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
         In addition to patent laws, we rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers and suppliers, proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants, and other similar measures. We do not have any material licenses or trademarks other than those relating to product names. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe our patents, patent applications, software and other proprietary know-how have value, rapidly evolving technology makes our future success dependent largely upon our ability to successfully achieve continuing innovation. 
         Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our proprietary rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend us against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in such litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, both in legal fees and expenses, as well as from the diversion of management's resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Employees 
         As of March 31, 2018, we employed 414 full-time employees and 33 part-time employees, for a total of 447 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
 Government Regulation 
         Our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those restricting the discharge of materials into the environment. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations. We continue to expend funds in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental regulations. These expenditures have not, however, been significant in the past, and we do not expect any significant expenditure in the near future. Currently, compliance with foreign laws has not had a material impact on our business; however, as we expand internationally, foreign laws and regulations could have a material impact on our business in the future.
