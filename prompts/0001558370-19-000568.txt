 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc. (“Griffin”) is a real estate business principally engaged in developing, managing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties, and to a lesser extent, office/flex properties. Griffin seeks to add to its property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or the purchase of buildings in select markets targeted by Griffin. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin’s core development and leasing strategy.
 Griffin’s buildings are located in the north submarket of Hartford, Connecticut, the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania and the greater Charlotte, North Carolina area. Griffin expects to continue to seek to acquire and develop properties that are consistent with its core strategy of developing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties. Griffin targets properties that are in close proximity to transportation infrastructure (highways, airports, railways and sea ports) and can accommodate single and multiple tenants in flexible layouts. Griffin expects that most of such potential acquisitions of either undeveloped land or land and buildings will likely be located outside of the Hartford area in select markets targeted by Griffin. 
 As of November 30, 2018, Griffin owned thirty‑seven buildings comprising approximately 4,078,000 square feet that was 93% leased. Approximately 89% of Griffin’s square footage is industrial/warehouse space, with the balance being office/flex space. As of November 30, 2018, approximately 95% of Griffin’s industrial/warehouse space was leased and approximately 72% of Griffin’s office/flex space was leased. As stated in “Item 2. Properties” below, Griffin generally uses nonrecourse mortgage loans and occasionally uses construction loans to finance some of its real estate development activities, and as of November 30, 2018, approximately $147.2 million was outstanding under all such loans. In fiscal 2018, profit from leasing activities (which Griffin defines as rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties)1 was approximately $23.2 million, while debt service (interest and scheduled principal payments) on nonrecourse mortgage loans and a construction loan was approximately $9.8 million.
 In fiscal 2018, Griffin completed and placed in service two industrial/warehouse buildings, one of which was an approximately 234,000 square foot build-to-suit building (“220 Tradeport”) in New England Tradeport (“NE Tradeport”), Griffin’s master‑planned industrial park near Bradley International Airport and Interstate 91, located in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut. As a build-to-suit building, Griffin entered into a twelve and a half year lease for 220 Tradeport prior to the start of construction. The other building completed in fiscal 2018 was an approximately 134,000 square foot building (“6975 Ambassador”), built on speculation, in the Lehigh Valley. 6975 Ambassador is not yet leased. In fiscal 2018, Griffin also leased approximately 70,000 square feet of previously vacant NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse space, including the remaining 63,000 square feet in 330 Stone Road (“330 Stone”) an approximately 137,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in NE Tradeport that was placed in service and partially leased just prior to the end of fiscal 2017. Griffin also extended leases aggregating approximately 408,000 square feet in fiscal 2018, including a full building lease of 4275 Fritch Drive, an approximately 228,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley. Also in fiscal 2018, Griffin completed a lease of approximately 11,000 square feet of previously vacant office/flex space. Leases for approximately 55,000 square feet (mostly industrial/warehouse space) expired in fiscal 2018 and were not re-leased. The net effect of Griffin’s leasing transactions in fiscal 2018 was an increase of approximately 256,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2018, as compared to November 30, 2017, and an increase of approximately 4,000 square feet of office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2018, as compared to November 30, 2017.
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin entered the Charlotte, North Carolina market with the purchase of 215 International Drive (“215 International”), an approximately 277,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Concord, North Carolina. Subsequent to completing the purchase, Griffin leased the approximately 73,000 square feet in that building that was vacant at the time of the acquisition. Also in fiscal 2017, Griffin completed construction, on speculation, of 330 Stone

 and leased approximately 74,000 square feet of that building to a tenant that relocated from approximately 39,000 square feet in another of Griffin’s NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings. The balance of 330 Stone was leased in fiscal 2018. Griffin was able to backfill the approximately 39,000 square feet that was vacated with a new tenant that took occupancy in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2017, Griffin also leased approximately 104,000 square feet of previously vacant NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse space, including a ten and a half year lease for approximately 89,000 square feet. Griffin extended leases aggregating approximately 387,000 square feet in fiscal 2017, including a full building lease of 100 International Drive (“100 International”), an approximately 304,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in NE Tradeport. That lease extension, done in connection with refinancing the mortgage loan on 100 International, resulted in an additional six years of lease term beyond the original lease expiration date of July 31, 2019. In fiscal 2017, Griffin completed a full building lease of approximately 23,000 square feet of office/flex space, replacing the tenant that did not renew its lease of that building. The net effect of Griffin’s construction, acquisition and leasing transactions in fiscal 2017 was an increase of approximately 461,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2017, as compared to November 30, 2016, and a decrease of approximately 11,000 square feet in office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2017, as compared to November 30, 2016.
 In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed and placed in service an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial building (“5210 Jaindl”) in the Lehigh Valley, thus completing the development of an approximately 50 acre parcel of undeveloped land acquired in December 2013. As of November 30, 2016, 5210 Jaindl was fully leased. In addition to the two leases at 5210 Jaindl, Griffin entered into several other leases aggregating approximately 240,000 square feet in fiscal 2016, all but approximately 21,000 square feet of which was for industrial/warehouse space. Included in the fiscal 2016 leasing activity was a lease for approximately 101,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive (“4270 Fritch”), an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley built in fiscal 2014. In addition to the Lehigh Valley leasing, Griffin completed several leases aggregating approximately 139,000 square feet for its Connecticut properties, including approximately 118,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space, mostly in NE Tradeport. In fiscal 2016, Griffin also extended leases aggregating approximately 248,000 square feet, most of which was NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse space. Also in fiscal 2016, leases for approximately 132,000 square feet expired,  including a lease for an entire approximately 57,000 square foot NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse building that was subsequently re-leased during fiscal 2016. The net effect of these transactions was an increase of approximately 410,000 square feet in industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, and a decrease of approximately 51,000 square feet in office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015.
 There is no guarantee that an active or strong real estate market or an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants will result in leasing space that was vacant as of November 30, 2018 or leasing space in buildings expected to be completed in 2019. Additional capacity or an increase in vacancies in either the industrial or office markets could adversely affect Griffin’s operating results by potentially resulting in longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates in Griffin’s properties or hindering renewals by existing tenants. There can be no assurances as to the directions of the Hartford, Lehigh Valley or Charlotte real estate markets in the near future.
 In fiscal 2018, Griffin completed a land sale of approximately 49 acres of undeveloped land in Southwick, Massachusetts (the “2018 Southwick Land Sale”) for approximately $0.9 million. The proceeds from the 2018 Southwick Land Sale were placed in escrow at closing and subsequently used in the acquisition of an approximately 22 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Concord, North Carolina (the ‘Concord Land”) as part of a like-kind exchange (a “1031 Like-Kind Exchange”) under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 1031 Like-Kind Exchange enabled Griffin to defer the gain on the 2018 Southwick Land Sale for income tax purposes. In fiscal 2018, Griffin commenced construction of two warehouse/industrial buildings totaling approximately 283,000 square feet on the Concord Land. Additionally, Griffin also completed one smaller land sale in fiscal 2018 for approximately $0.1 million.
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin completed several land sales, the largest being the sale of approximately 67 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing (the “2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale”) for approximately $10.3 million. The land sold under the 2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale is part of an approximately 268 acre parcel of land in Bloomfield and Windsor, Connecticut known as Phoenix Crossing. The proceeds from the 2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale were placed in escrow at closing and subsequently used in the acquisition of 215 International as part of a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. In addition to the 2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale, Griffin also sold approximately 76 acres of undeveloped land in Southwick, Massachusetts (the “2017 Southwick Land Sale”) for approximately $2.1 million. The proceeds from 

 
  5

 
the 2017 Southwick Land Sale were also placed in escrow at closing and subsequently used for the purchase of approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley under a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. In fiscal 2018, Griffin constructed 6975 Ambassador on the Lehigh Valley land acquired. 
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin also completed two smaller sales of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing for a total of approximately $1.3 million and the sale of two small residential lots for a total of approximately $0.2 million. Griffin also recognized the remaining $0.1 million of revenue from the fiscal 2013 sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing (the “2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale”). Under the terms of the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale, Griffin and the buyer each were required to construct roadways connecting the land parcel that was sold to existing town roads. As a result of Griffin’s continuing involvement with the land sold, the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale was accounted for under the percentage of completion method, whereby revenue and gain were recognized as costs related to the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale were incurred. From the closing of the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale through fiscal 2017, when Griffin completed its required roadwork, Griffin recognized total revenue of approximately $9.0 million and a total pretax gain of approximately $6.7 million from the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale.
 In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed one land sale for approximately $3.8 million and recognized revenue of approximately $0.6 million related to the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale. 
 Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin’s core development and leasing strategy. Such sale transactions may take place either before or after obtaining development approvals and building basic infrastructure.
 Griffin’s development of its land is affected by regulatory and other constraints. Subdivision and commercial or residential development of land may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate growth. Development of Griffin’s undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies. Portions of Griffin’s landholdings in Connecticut are zoned for residential and office uses. The weakness in these markets has adversely affected Griffin, and may continue to do so in the future, by potentially lowering selling prices for land intended for such uses or delaying sales or development of such land.

      Griffin’s total portfolio of approximately 2,051,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in Connecticut was 98% leased as of November 30, 2018. A significant portion of Griffin’s industrial development in Connecticut is in NE Tradeport, where Griffin has built and currently owns fifteen industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 1,837,000 square feet. Griffin owns three industrial/warehouse buildings in Connecticut that are not located in NE Tradeport, including a 165,000 square foot industrial building (“1985 Blue Hills”) in Windsor, Connecticut, that is being used principally as a data center and call center. Under the terms of the full building lease of 1985 Blue Hills, which runs through March 31, 2024 with several options to renew, the tenant has the option to purchase the building from March 1, 2021 through May 1, 2021 at a purchase price that is the greater of $11.5 million or fair market value as determined under the terms of the lease.
 In fiscal 2018, Griffin leased approximately 331,000 square feet in NE Tradeport, including the full building lease of approximately 234,000 square feet in 220 Tradeport and approximately 63,000 square feet in 330 Stone. Approximately 27,000 square feet of the fiscal 2018 leasing replaced existing leases that expired and were not renewed.  Also in fiscal 2018, Griffin renewed several leases aggregating approximately 180,000 square feet, including a full building lease for approximately 127,000 square feet at 759 Rainbow Road. The rental rates for leases in NE Tradeport that were renewed in fiscal 2018 were, on average, essentially unchanged from the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the two NE Tradeport leases aggregating approximately 46,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2019 are approximately 10% below market rates for similar space.
 The Q4 2018 CBRE|New England Marketview Report (“Q4 2018 CBRE|New England Report”) from CBRE Group, Inc. (“CBRE”), a national real estate services company, stated that the vacancy rate in the greater Hartford industrial market decreased to 7.2% at the end of 2018 from 8.8% at the end of 2017, and that net absorption in the greater Hartford industrial market in 2018 was approximately 1.2 million square feet. The Q4 2018 CBRE|New England Report also stated that the vacancy rate in the north submarket of Hartford, where Griffin’s properties are located, decreased to 5.4% at the end of 2018 from 6.3% at the end of 2017, with net absorption of approximately 0.3 million square feet in 2018. The decrease in the Hartford industrial market vacancy rate in 2018 continued the downward trend from 2014, when the vacancy rate in the Hartford industrial market was 12.3%.
 In NE Tradeport, Griffin holds entitlements to potentially develop an additional approximately 440,000 square feet, consisting of one approved building site on approximately 34 acres and approved additions to two of its existing buildings. Griffin owns an additional 99 acres of undeveloped land within NE Tradeport, 60 acres of which are in Windsor and the abutting 39 acres of which are in East Granby. Full approvals for the development of this remaining

land for industrial use are not in place, and the East Granby land would require a zone change for industrial development. Parts of such acreage may not be developable. Griffin believes that additional infrastructure improvements, which may be significant, may be required to obtain approvals to develop portions of this land, particularly the land in East Granby. Griffin expects to continue to direct much of its real estate efforts in Connecticut on the construction and leasing of industrial/warehouse facilities in NE Tradeport and other suitably located land currently owned. As of November 30, 2018, Griffin also owns approximately 76 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing that is zoned for industrial and commercial development.
 As of November 30, 2018, approximately $86.4 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in its Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings, approximately $2.8 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in the undeveloped NE Tradeport land and approximately $1.5 million was invested in the undeveloped Phoenix Crossing land. As of November 30, 2018, sixteen of Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings were mortgaged for an aggregate of approximately $82.6 million. 
 Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania
 A summary of Griffin’s Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse square footage at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:

      Since Griffin entered the Lehigh Valley market in fiscal 2010, Griffin has purchased a fully leased approximately 120,000 square foot industrial building, acquired approximately 114 acres of undeveloped land and built, on speculation, five industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 1,197,000 square feet on the land acquired. As of November 30, 2018, Griffin owned six industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley aggregating approximately 1,317,000 square feet.
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin acquired an approximately 14 acre parcel of undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 completed 6975 Ambassador, an approximately 134,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, built on speculation on that land parcel. 6975 Ambassador is not yet leased, however, Griffin’s other five buildings in Lehigh Valley are fully leased. In fiscal 2018, Griffin renewed a full building lease for one of its Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings at a rental rate 12% higher than the rental rate in effect at the time of the renewal. Approximately $72.9 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin’s Lehigh Valley buildings as of November 30, 2018. All Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings, except 6975 Ambassador, are mortgaged under three separate nonrecourse mortgage loans for a total of approximately $48.4 million as of November 30, 2018. 
 The vacancy rate of Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse properties, in the counties where Griffin’s Lehigh Valley properties are located, as reported in CBRE’s Q4 2018 Marketview Lehigh Valley PA Industrial Report (the “Q4 2018 CBRE Lehigh Valley Report”) was 4.8% at the end of 2018, with a net absorption of approximately 5.5 million square feet in 2018.

 On January 11, 2018, Griffin entered into an agreement to purchase an approximately 14 acre parcel of undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley (the “Lehigh Valley Land”). Subsequently, the agreement was amended to reduce the purchase price from $3.6 million in cash to $3.1 million in cash and extend the due diligence and entitlement periods. If the transaction closes, Griffin plans to construct an approximately 156,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building on the Lehigh Valley Land. The closing of this purchase, anticipated to take place in fiscal 2019, is subject to several conditions, including obtaining all governmental approvals for Griffin’s development plans for the Lehigh Valley Land. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 Charlotte, North Carolina
 A summary of Griffin’s Charlotte, North Carolina industrial/warehouse square footage at the end of each of the past two fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Charlotte, North Carolina industrial/warehouse building scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:

      In fiscal 2017, Griffin completed its first acquisition of property in the Charlotte, North Carolina area when it acquired 215 International, which was constructed in 2015 and 74% leased when it was acquired. Subsequent to the closing, one of the tenants in 215 International leased the remaining approximately 73,000 square feet that had been vacant at the time the building was acquired. As of November 30, 2018, approximately $17.4 million was invested (net book value) in 215 International, and this building was mortgaged under a nonrecourse mortgage loan for approximately $11.9 million. CBRE’s Q4 2018 Marketview Charlotte Industrial Report stated a vacancy rate of 5.3% for warehouse space at the end of 2018 and absorption of 4.8 million square feet of warehouse space in 2018.
 In the fiscal 2018 third quarter, Griffin purchased the Concord Land for approximately $2.7 million in cash, including acquisition expenses. Approximately $0.8 million of the purchase price of the Concord Land was paid using the proceeds from the 2018 Southwick Land Sale to complete a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. In the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, Griffin started site work and construction, on speculation, on two industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 283,000 square feet on the Concord Land. Griffin expects to spend approximately $15.0 million for the site work and construction of those two buildings, with expected completion of the buildings in the second half of fiscal 2019.
 On June 26, 2018, Griffin entered into an agreement for the purchase of approximately 36 acres of undeveloped land in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina in the greater Charlotte area (the “Mecklenburg Land”) for approximately $4.7 million in cash. On December 5, 2018, Griffin entered into an agreement for the purchase of approximately 9 acres of undeveloped land (the “Additional Mecklenburg Land”) that is adjacent to the Mecklenburg Land for approximately $0.9 million in cash. If acquired, the Additional Mecklenburg Land is expected to be combined with the Mecklenburg Land to enable Griffin to construct more industrial/warehouse space than could be constructed on the Mecklenburg Land alone. Closings on the purchases of the Mecklenburg Land and the Additional Mecklenburg Land are subject to several conditions, including obtaining all governmental approvals for Griffin’s development plans. Griffin would only complete the purchase of the Additional Mecklenburg Land if the Mecklenburg Land is acquired. The amount of industrial/warehouse space to be developed on the Mecklenburg Land and, if also acquired, the Additional Mecklenburg Land, will be based upon findings during the approvals process. The closings on the purchases of the Mecklenburg Land

and the Additional Mecklenburg Land are not anticipated to take place until the third quarter of fiscal 2019. There is no guarantee that the purchases of the Mecklenburg Land and the Additional Mecklenburg Land will be completed under their current terms, or at all.
     Griffin may seek to acquire additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate business. Griffin continues to examine potential properties for acquisition in the Middle Atlantic, Northeast and Southeast regions and selected markets targeted by Griffin. Real estate acquisitions may or may not occur based on many factors, including real estate pricing. Griffin may commence speculative construction projects on its undeveloped land that is either currently owned or acquired in the future if it believes market conditions are favorable for such development. Griffin may also construct additional build-to-suit facilities on its undeveloped land if lease terms are favorable.
 Office/Flex Properties
 A summary of Griffin’s office/flex square footage at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s office/flex buildings scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:

 | Square | Square | | 
 | Footage | Footage | Percentage | 
 | Owned | Leased | Leased | 
November 30, 2016 | 433,000 | 319,000 | 74 | %

Annual rental revenue of expiring leases as a percentage of Griffin’s total fiscal 2018 rental revenue | | 3 | % | | 4 | % | | 2 | %

      All of Griffin’s office/flex properties are located in Griffin Center in Windsor and Bloomfield, Connecticut and Griffin Center South in Bloomfield, which are in the north submarket of Hartford. The Hartford office/flex market remained weak in 2018, as evidenced by vacancy rates at the end of 2018, as stated in the Q4 2018 CBRE|New England Report, of 17.2% for the overall Hartford market and 33.6% in north submarket of Hartford. 
 In Griffin Center, Griffin currently owns two multi‑story office buildings that have an aggregate of approximately 161,000 square feet, a single story office building of approximately 48,000 square feet and a small restaurant building of approximately 7,000 square feet. In Griffin Center South, Griffin currently owns eight office/flex buildings with an aggregate of approximately 217,000 square feet of single story office/flex space. Griffin’s office/flex square footage was approximately 72% leased as of November 30, 2018.
 As of November 30, 2018, Griffin’s total office/flex space of approximately 433,000 square feet comprised approximately 11% of Griffin’s total square footage. Griffin expects that its office/flex space will continue to become a smaller percentage of its total space as Griffin expects to focus on the growth of its industrial/warehouse building portfolio either through the acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired, or both.
 In fiscal 2018, Griffin entered into a five year lease for approximately 11,000 square feet at 320 West Newberry Road in Griffin Center South that was previously vacant. Additionally, Griffin renewed a lease for approximately 8,000 square feet of office/flex space in fiscal 2018 at the same rate as the expiring lease and the lease for the approximately 7,000 square foot restaurant building expired. Management believes that the rental rates on the leases for office/flex space scheduled to expire in fiscal 2019 are approximately 15% higher than the market rates for similar space.

 Currently there are approximately 156 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center and approximately 75 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center South that are owned by Griffin. As of November 30, 2018, approximately $17.8 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin’s office/flex buildings and approximately $1.6 million was invested by Griffin in the undeveloped land in Griffin Center and Griffin Center South. Griffin’s two multi‑story office buildings in Griffin Center are mortgaged for approximately $4.3 million as of November 30, 2018, and Griffin’s single story office building in Griffin Center and the eight single-story office/flex buildings and an industrial/warehouse building in Griffin Center South are the collateral for Griffin’s $15.0 million revolving line of credit. There were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of November 30, 2018.
 Residential Developments
 Simsbury, Connecticut
 Several years ago, Griffin filed plans for Meadowood, a proposed residential community in Simsbury, Connecticut (“Simsbury”). After several years of litigation with the town regarding this proposed residential development, a settlement was reached. The settlement terms included, among other items, approval for up to 296 homes, certain remediation measures and offsite road improvements to be performed by Griffin and the purchase by Simsbury of a portion of the Meadowood land for open space. The sale of land to Simsbury closed in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2012, Griffin performed a portion of the required remediation work on the site and completed the required offsite road improvements. In fiscal 2014, Griffin completed the required remediation work. As of November 30, 2018, the book value of the land for this development, including design, development and legal costs, was approximately $8.5 million. Griffin is continuing to evaluate its plans for Meadowood. Suffield, Connecticut
 In fiscal 2006, Griffin completed the infrastructure for a fifty lot residential subdivision in Suffield, Connecticut called Stratton Farms. Griffin sold twenty‑five residential lots in Stratton Farms to a local homebuilder in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. Griffin subsequently sold six additional lots. As of November 30, 2018, Griffin held nineteen Stratton Farms residential lots. The book value for Griffin’s Stratton Farms was approximately $1.0 million at November 30, 2018.  Other
 Concurrent with Griffin’s sale in fiscal 2014 of its landscape nursery business, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. (“Imperial”), Griffin and the buyer, Monrovia Connecticut LLC (“Monrovia”) entered into a Lease and Option Agreement, which was amended in fiscal 2016 (as amended, the “Imperial Lease”) pursuant to which Monrovia leased Imperial’s production nursery located in Granby and East Granby, Connecticut (the “Connecticut Farm”) for a ten year period. The Imperial Lease grants Monrovia options to extend the term for up to an additional fifteen years and to purchase the land, land improvements and other operating assets that were used by Imperial on the Connecticut Farm during the first thirteen years of the lease period for $9.5 million, or $7.0 million if only a certain portion of the Connecticut Farm is purchased, subject in each case to certain adjustments as provided for in the Imperial Lease. 
 Prior to the fiscal 2009 third quarter, Imperial operated a production nursery in Quincy, Florida (the “Florida Farm”). In fiscal 2009, Imperial shut down its growing operations on the Florida Farm and leased that facility to a grower of landscape nursery plants. After the expiration of that lease, Griffin entered into a new three year lease of the Florida Farm with another grower that started July 1, 2016. On December 18, 2017, the tenant leasing the Florida Farm filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and subsequently rejected the Florida Farm Lease effective September 15, 2018. The lease of the Florida Farm had a rental rate of $0.5 million per year at the time it was terminated. On September 28, 2018, Griffin and the tenant entered into a Stipulated Order whereby Griffin agreed to allow the tenant to remain on the Florida Farm through October 31, 2018 at the then current rental rate under the Florida Farm Lease. Griffin received all rent due under the Florida Farm Lease and the Stipulated Order. The Florida Farm was not leased as of November 30, 2018. Griffin is currently marketing the Florida Farm for sale or lease.
 In fiscal 2018, Griffin leased approximately 427 acres of undeveloped land in Connecticut and Massachusetts to local farmers. Approximately 560 acres and 650 acres were leased to local farmers in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. The revenue generated from the leasing of farmland is not material to Griffin’s total revenue.

 On January 25, 2016, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the “Simsbury Option Agreement”), subsequently amended on January 22, 2019. Under the terms of the Simsbury Option Agreement, as amended, Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive option to purchase approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury, Connecticut for approximately $7.7 million. Through November 30, 2018, the buyer paid approximately $0.3 million of option fees to extend its option period through January 25, 2019. In fiscal 2018, the buyer received approval from Connecticut’s regulatory authority for the buyer’s planned use of the land, which is to generate solar electricity. Subsequent litigation challenging that approval was settled during fiscal 2018, thereby allowing the buyer to use the land to be purchased as planned. On January 24, 2019, the buyer exercised its option to purchase the land under the Simsbury Option Agreement, as amended. As per the terms of the Simsbury Option Agreement, as amended, closing on the land sale contemplated by the Simsbury Option Agreement, as amended, is required to take place within 90 days from the date the buyer exercised its option to purchase the land. There is no guarantee that the sale of land as contemplated under the Simsbury Option Agreement, as amended, will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 On May 5, 2017, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the “EGW Option Agreement”) whereby Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive option to purchase approximately 288 acres of undeveloped land in East Granby and Windsor, Connecticut for approximately $7.8 million. The buyer intended to use the land to generate solar electricity. The buyer’s option expired on May 5, 2018 and was not extended, thus terminating the EGW Option Agreement. Accordingly, the buyer forfeited the option fees (approximately $50,000) paid through that date.
 Employees
 As of November 30, 2018, Griffin had 34 employees, including 33 full‑time employees. Presently, none of Griffin’s employees are represented by a union. Griffin believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory. Competition
 The market for leasing industrial/warehouse space and office/flex space is highly competitive. Griffin competes for tenants with owners of numerous properties in the areas where Griffin’s buildings are located. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin. Griffin’s real estate business competes on the bases of location, price, availability of space, convenience and amenities.
 There is a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse buildings and for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings. Griffin competes for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse properties with real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and institutional investors, such as pension funds, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, public and private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants or the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages from a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity. 
 Regulation: Environmental Matters
 Under various federal and state laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate properly such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real estate properties, Griffin may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. The value of Griffin’s land may be affected by the presence of residual chemicals from the prior use of the land for farming, principally on a portion of the land that is intended for residential use. In the event that Griffin is unable to remediate adequately any of its land intended for residential use, Griffin’s ability to develop such property for its intended purposes would be materially affected.

 Griffin periodically reviews its properties for the purpose of evaluating such properties’ compliance with applicable federal and state environmental laws. In connection with the sale of Imperial, Griffin incurred a small amount of costs to remediate a small area of the Connecticut Farm that is leased to Monrovia under the Imperial Lease. As of the date of this Annual Report, Griffin is in discussions with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (“DEEP”) regarding findings of exceedances of certain residual pesticides on a limited portion of the Connecticut Farm being leased to Monrovia. At this time, Griffin does not anticipate experiencing, in the next twelve months, any material expense in complying with such laws on any of its properties. Griffin may incur remediation costs in the future in connection with its development operations. Such costs are not expected to be significant as compared to expected proceeds from development projects or property sales.
