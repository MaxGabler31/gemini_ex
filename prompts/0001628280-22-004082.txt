Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Aurinia is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies to treat targeted patient populations that are suffering from serious diseases with a high unmet medical need. We have commercially launched LUPKYNIS in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with active LN. We continue to conduct pre-clinical, clinical, and regulatory activities to support the voclosporin development program as well as our other assets. 
On January 22, 2021, the FDA approved LUPKYNIS in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen to treat adult patients with active LN. 
On August 17, 2021, we announced the addition of two novel assets, AUR200 and AUR300. AUR200 is currently undergoing pre-clinical development with projected submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA in 2023. It is anticipated that an IND for AUR300 will be submitted during the first half of 2023.
On December 9, 2021, we announced positive topline results from the AURORA 2 continuation study, evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of LUPKYNIS.
LUPKYNIS is an orally administered CNI immunosuppressant, that has demonstrated improvement in near and long-term outcomes in LN when used in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis. By inhibiting calcineurin, LUPKYNIS reduces cytokine activation and blocks interleukin IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses. LUPKYNIS also potentially stabilizes podocytes, which can protect against proteinuria. Voclosporin, the active ingredient in LUPKYNIS, is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule. The mechanism of action of LUPKYNIS has been validated with certain earlier generation CNIs for the prevention of rejection in patients undergoing solid organ transplants and in several autoimmune indications, including uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and for LN in Japan. We believe that LUPKYNIS possesses pharmacologic properties with the potential to demonstrate best-in-class differentiation.
Earlier generation CNIs have demonstrated efficacy for a number of conditions, including transplant and other autoimmune diseases; however, side effects exist which can limit their long-term use and tolerability. Some clinical complications of earlier generation CNIs include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and both acute and chronic nephrotoxicity.
Based on published data, we believe the key potential benefits of LUPKYNIS in the treatment of adult patients with active LN versus marketed CNIs include:
•increased potency compared to cyclosporine A, allowing for lower dosing requirements and potentially fewer off-target effects;
•limited inter- and intra-patient variability, allowing for easier dosing without the need for monitoring blood levels for therapeutic drug monitoring;
•less cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia than cyclosporine A; and
•limited incidence of glucose intolerance and new onset diabetes at therapeutic doses compared to tacrolimus. 
STRATEGY
Our business strategy is to optimize the clinical and commercial value of LUPKYNIS and become a commercial biopharmaceutical company with a global product portfolio focused on rare kidney and autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical needs. This includes the evaluation of LUPKYNIS in novel formulations, as well as the addition of new pipeline assets that align with our core expertise.
We have developed a strategic plan to execute on our commercialization of LUPKYNIS as a treatment of adult patients with active LN. The key tactics to achieve our corporate strategy:
•conducting post-commercial activities including build out of the organization to efficiently and effectively market LUPKYNIS as a treatment of adult patients with active LN;
•engaging Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) as a collaboration partner for development and commercialization of LUPKYNIS in Europe and Japan; as part of this, a marketing authorization application (MAA) was filed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first half of 2021, an MAA was filed with the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) in the second half of 2021, and Otsuka plans to seek regulatory approval in other territories including the United Kingdom and Japan;
•conducting various studies to thoroughly characterize the clinical profile of LUPKYNIS, including post-marketing studies as agreed with regulatory agencies as part of product approval;
•ensuring adequate supply of LUPKYNIS by entering into strategic long term supply agreements with our key suppliers; 
•conducting our planned R&D activities to further the advancement of our existing pipeline (AUR200 and AUR300); and
•evaluating external assets with the potential to be synergistic and complementary to our clinical, regulatory and therapeutic areas of expertise.
DEVELOPMENTS
Regulatory/Commercial
•On January 22, 2021, the FDA approved LUPKYNIS in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen to treat adult patients with active LN. As a condition of approval, we are required and are on track to conduct two pediatric studies (with reports due in 2025 and 2031), a milk only lactation study (with a report due in 2026), a drug-drug interaction study (with a report due in 2023) and submit a final study report on our AURORA 2 continuation study (by March 2022).
•On June 25, 2021, our licensing partner, Otsuka, filed an initial MAA with the EMA seeking approval for the use of voclosporin for the treatment of adult patients with active LN in the European Union, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Upon approval by the EMA, we would be eligible for up to an additional $30 million as an approval related milestones, in addition to low double-digit royalties on sales and revenues for the supply of product to Otsuka under a cost-plus arrangement.
•On August 17, 2021, we announced the addition of two novel pipeline assets AUR200 and AUR300. AUR200 is an Fc protein targeting BAFF/APRIL (B-cell Activating Factor, known as BAFF, and A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand known as APRIL). AUR200 is currently undergoing pre-clinical development with projected submission of an IND to the FDA in 2023. AUR300 is a novel peptide therapeutic that modulates M2 macrophages (a type of white blood cells) via the macrophage mannose receptor CD206. Dysregulation of M2 macrophages drives fibrosis. AUR300 acts to reduce M2 dysregulation and decrease inflammatory cytokines, and therefore may have significant clinical applications for autoimmune and fibrotic diseases. AUR300 IND filing is expected during the first half of 2023.
•On October 1, 2021, Aurinia’s licensing partner, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., filed an initial MAA with the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) seeking approval for the use of voclosporin for the treatment of adult patients with active LN. The Swissmedic filing was based on the June 25, 2021 MAA submission to the EMA.
Corporate
•On June 7, 2021, our shareholders adopted and approved the Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan), which allows for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 23,815,115 common shares (inclusive of the number of common shares subject to awards outstanding under the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company by encouraging equity participation in the Company through the acquisition of common shares. Also in June 2021, our shareholders adopted and approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which allows for the issuance of up to 2.5 million shares. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees with opportunities to purchase common shares at a discounted price.
•On June 14, 2021, we appointed Dr. Brinda Balakrishnan, M.D., Ph.D., to our Board of Directors. Dr. Balakrishnan is Group Vice President, Corporate and Business Development of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.
•On July 16, 2021, we announced we would voluntarily delist the common shares from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) effective as of the close of trading on July 30, 2021.
Study Milestones and Publications 
•On March 15, 2021, we announced a favorable assessment regarding the cost-effectiveness and value of LUPKYNIS, based on an independent analysis issued by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) in a revised Evidence Report issued on March 12, 2021. The ICER report finds that LUPKYNIS represents an important new treatment option for patients living with LN and, at the estimated net price, determined the therapy to be priced in alignment with ICER’s recommended health-benefit price benchmark ranges.
•On May 10, 2021, The Lancet, an international, peer-reviewed medical journal, published the results of the Company’s Phase 3 AURORA 1 study evaluating LUPKYNIS in adults with LN.
•On December 9, 2021, we announced positive topline results from AURORA 2, a 2-year continuation study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of LUPKYNIS. 
Market Potential and Commercial Considerations
We have conducted extensive market research and analyses of peer reviewed publications to assess market potential and commercial opportunity. Our physician research included more than 1,100 rheumatologists and nephrologists across the United States, Europe and Japan to assess the potential market for adoption of LUPKYNIS and estimate pricing and treatment paradigms. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that up to 50% of adults with SLE are diagnosed with LN at some point in their journey with lupus. Using the research and publication analyses, we estimate the number of SLE patients diagnosed with LN to be about 80,000 to 120,000 in the United States.
Similar to other autoimmune disorders, LN is a flaring and remitting disease. The disease can cycle from being in remission to being in an active flare, to achieving partial response and potentially to achieving a complete response and therefore back in 
remission. Treatment objectives between LN and other autoimmune diseases are remarkably similar. In other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE, physicians’ goals are to induce and maintain a remission of disease, decrease frequency of hospital or ambulatory care visits and limit long term disability. In LN specifically, physicians are trying to avoid further kidney damage, kidney failure, dialysis, kidney transplantation, and death. The ability to get patients into remission quickly correlates with better long-term kidney outcomes as noted above. Achieving a complete response, and most importantly, rapidly reducing the level of urine protein, is also believed to be an important factor in delaying and/or reducing the rate of progression to kidney failure and need for replacement therapy. Kidney failure is associated with extremely poor health outcomes as a life-long, costly state in which patients are dependent upon dialysis or the availability of a kidney transplant.
The population of people with LN will be in different cycles of their disease at any one time. Prior to the approval of LUPKYNIS, physicians would generally use a combination of MMF and steroids to treat people with LN throughout the disease cycles. The clinical data generated in our Phase 2 AURA-LV and our Phase 3 AURORA studies has demonstrated that LUPKYNIS can achieve a more than two times higher rate of complete response than when given in combination with a MMF and steroids. The clinical data generated in our AURORA 2 continuation study demonstrated a continuation of these results over an aggregate of a three year period for the patients that enrolled, with no unexpected safety signals.
The price of LUPKYNIS is based on one unit of 60 capsules we refer to as a “wallet”. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of a LUPKYNIS wallet is currently $4,226.50. Based on our patient-specific eGFR dosing regimens, the average utilization in our clinical trials, and accounting for factors including mandatory rebates, channel discounts, and anticipated patient adherence and compliance, we expect the average annualized net revenue per patient for us to be approximately $65,000. When determining the price of LUPKYNIS, we considered the burden of LN disease in the context of value that this innovative product offers to patients and the US healthcare system.
Voclosporin Mechanism of Action
Voclosporin reversibly inhibits immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly T-Lymphocytes in the G0 and G1 phase of the cell-cycle, and also reversibly inhibits the production and release of lymphokines. Through a number of processes voclosporin inhibits and prevents the activation of various transcription factors necessary for the induction of cytokine genes during T-cell activation. It is believed that the inhibition of activation of T-cells will have a positive modulatory effect in the treatment of LN. In addition to these immunologic impacts, recent data suggests that CNIs have another subtle but important impact on the structural integrity of the podocytes. This data suggests that inhibition of calcineurin in patients with autoimmune kidney diseases helps stabilize the cellular actin-cytoskeleton of the podocytes thus having a structural impact on the podocyte and the subsequent leakage of protein into the urine, which is a key marker of patients suffering from LN.
Scientific Rationale for Treatment of LN with LUPKYNIS
While SLE is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease (often with multiple organ and immune system involvement), LN has straightforward disease outcomes. T-cell mediated immune response is an important feature of the pathogenesis of LN while the podocyte injury that occurs in conjunction with the ongoing immune insult in the kidney is an important factor in the clinical presentation of the disease. An early response in LN correlates with long-term outcomes and is clearly measured by proteinuria.
The use of LUPKYNIS in combination with MMF and steroids for the treatment of adult patients with active LN provides a novel approach to treating this disease. LUPKYNIS has shown to have potent effects on T-cell activation leading to its immunomodulatory effects. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that inhibition of calcineurin has direct physical impacts on the podocytes within the kidney. Inhibition of calcineurin within the podocytes can prevent the dephosphorylation of synaptopodin which in turn inhibits the degradation of the actin cytoskeleton within the podocyte. This process is expected to have a direct impact on the levels of protein in the urine which is a key marker of LN disease activity. 
Voclosporin Development History
More than 2,600 subjects have been dosed with voclosporin in clinical trials including studies where voclosporin was compared to placebo or active control. The safety and tolerability profile of the drug has been well characterized. Phase 2 or later clinical studies that have been completed include studies in the following indications:
Psoriasis: Two Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis have been completed. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was a reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, which is a common measure of psoriasis disease severity. The first study treatment with voclosporin resulted in statistically significantly greater success rates than treatment with placebo by the twelfth week. In a second study comparing voclosporin against cyclosporine, the drug was not shown to be 
statistically non-inferior to cyclosporine in terms of efficacy; however, voclosporin proved superior in terms of limiting elevations in hyperlipidemia. Due to the evolving psoriasis market dynamics and the changing standard of care for the treatment of this disease, we have decided not to pursue further Phase 3 development.
Kidney Transplantation: A Phase 2b clinical trial in de novo kidney transplant recipients was completed. Study ISA05-01, the PROMISE Study was a six-month study with a six-month extension comparing voclosporin directly against tacrolimus on a background of MMF and corticosteroids. Voclosporin was shown to be equivalent in efficacy (prevention of acute rejection of the transplanted kidney), but superior to tacrolimus with respect to the incidence of new onset diabetes after transplantation. Due to the ongoing evolution of the commercial market in kidney transplantation, including tacrolimus losing patent exclusivity in most world markets, combined with the cost and timeline that would have been associated with additional clinical trials, we have chosen not to pursue further internal clinical development in kidney transplantation.
Uveitis: Multiple studies in various forms of non-infectious uveitis were completed by Lux Biosciences, Inc., one of our former licensees, indicating mixed efficacy. In all but one of the studies, completed by the licensee, an impact on disease activity was shown in the voclosporin group. However, achievement of the primary end-points in multiple studies could not be shown. Uveitis is a notoriously difficult disease to study due to the heterogeneity of the patient population and the lack of validated clinical end-points. However, in all of the uveitis studies completed, the safety results were consistent, and the drug was well tolerated. We retained a portfolio of additional patents that Lux Biosciences, Inc. had been prosecuting that are focused on delivering effective concentrations of voclosporin to various ocular tissues following the termination of our licensing agreement in 2014. 
Dry eye syndrome (DES): We completed a Phase 2 head to head study for the treatment of DES versus Restasis®, with results reported in January 2019. Both drugs were shown to be well tolerated and there was no statistical difference for the primary endpoint. However, on key pre-specified secondary endpoints of Schirmer Tear Test and fluorescein corneal staining, voclosporin showed rapid and statistically significant improvements over Restasis®. As a result, we followed up with a Phase 2/3 study which reported results in November 2020. That study did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint compared to vehicle. As a result, we suspended the development of voclosporin for DES in 2020.
FDA Approval and Commercial Launch of LUPKYNIS
On January 22, 2021, the FDA approved LUPKYNIS in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen to treat adult patients with active LN. As a condition of approval, we will be required to conduct two pediatric studies (with reports due in 2025 and 2031), a milk only lactation study (with a report due in 2026), a drug-drug interaction study (with a 
report due in 2023) and submit a final study report on our AURORA-2 continuation study (by March 2022). These post-approval conditions all remain in progress within the expected timelines.
Completion of AURORA 2 Continuation Study
On December 9, 2021, we announced positive topline results from the AURORA 2 2-year continuation study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of LUPKYNIS. AURORA 2 (NCT03597464) was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of voclosporin, in addition to MMF and steroids. Patients who completed 12 months of treatment in the Phase 3 AURORA 1 study were eligible to enroll in the AURORA 2 continuation study with the same randomized treatment of voclosporin at 23.7 mg twice daily or placebo, in combination with MMF at 1 g twice daily with low-dose oral steroids, for up to an additional 24 months. A total of 216 LN patients out of 357 who were enrolled in the AURORA 1 study continued into AURORA 2, with 116 patients in the voclosporin group and 100 patients in the control group. 90 and 78 patients, respectively, received 36 months of total treatment at the completion of the study. Compared to the active control group, the voclosporin-treated group showed an increase from baseline eGFR at the end of the studies of +2.7 mL/min. The study demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile over a three-year period, with safety comparable to AURORA 1, and sustained efficacy.
Investigator-Initiated Trial to Evaluate Antiviral Activity of LUPKYNIS in Kidney Transplant Recipients with COVID-19 (VOCOVID)
On October 27, 2020 we announced the funding and initiation of an open-label exploratory trial evaluating the antiviral effects of voclosporin in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) or the VOCOVID study. The single-center, investigator-initiated trial (IIT) is being conducted by Drs. Aiko P.J. de Vries and Y.K. Onno Teng at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands and will compare voclosporin against tacrolimus.
Organ transplant recipients who contract COVID-19 are at greater risk for complications due to the requirement of daily immunosuppressive medications to prevent organ rejection. CNIs, like voclosporin, have been shown in prior in vitro studies to inhibit viral replication. The team at LUMC demonstrated that voclosporin inhibited viral replication of COVID-19 at an 8-fold lower concentration than tacrolimus in vitro, while maintaining cell viability of infected cells. In contrast to voclosporin, tacrolimus did not show antiviral activity against COVID-19 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, given its potency and dosing advantages, voclosporin is a potentially attractive CNI for COVID-19 infected transplant patients who are already using legacy CNIs as part of their chronic immunosuppressive therapy.
This 56-day open-label IIT is designed to evaluate the antiviral effects of voclosporin compared to tacrolimus in stable KTRs who contracted COVID-19. At study entry, 20 KTRs testing positive for COVID-19 and currently on dual immunosuppressives of prednisone and tacrolimus were randomized 1:1 to remain on tacrolimus or be switched to voclosporin. The primary endpoint is the reduction in COVID-19 viral load over 56 days, as measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The study will also assess predefined endpoints as surrogate markers of improved viral clearance including time to 3-log reduction in viral load concentration, time to clinical recovery – defined as free of symptoms for five days or more, and safety and tolerability. As of December 31, 2021, the data collection is ongoing.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our policy has been to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business. 
We have an extensive granted patent portfolio covering voclosporin, including granted United States patents, for composition of matter, methods of use, formulations and synthesis, and the rights to certain corresponding Canadian, South African and Israeli patents are owned by Paladin Labs Inc. We anticipate that patent protection for voclosporin will be extended in the United States (Patent Term Extension) and certain other major markets, including Europe and Japan, until at least October 2027 under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and comparable patent extension laws in other countries (including the Supplementary Protection Certificate program in Europe). We have applied for the Patent Term Extension, and are awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). If the Patent Term Extension is not granted prior to the expiry of our patent term, we intend to file an interim patent term extension until the USPTO completes its review of the Patent Term Extension. Opportunities may also be available to add an additional six months of exclusivity related to our planned pediatric studies. In addition to patent rights, we have received "new chemical entity" exclusivity for LUPKYNIS in the United States, which provides for exclusivity until January 22, 2026, and we expect to receive “new chemical entity” exclusivity for voclosporin in certain other countries, which provides exclusivity for up to ten years in Europe.
In May 2019, we were granted U.S. Patent No. 10,286,036 with a term extending to December 2037, with claims directed at our LUPKYNIS dosing protocol for LN used in our clinical trials. This dosing protocol is reflected on the prescribing information approved by the FDA for LUPKYNIS. Notably, the allowed claims cover a method of modifying the dose of LUPKYNIS in patients with LN based on patient specific pharmacodynamic parameters. On February 24, 2022, Sun Pharmaceuticals Inc. petitioned for an inter partes review by the USPTO in respect of this patent. We are currently reviewing the petition and considering our response and next steps. We have also filed for protection of this subject matter under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and are applying for similar protection in the member countries thereof. This may lead to the granting of similar claims in other major global pharmaceutical markets.
COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Many companies, including major pharmaceutical as well as specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in activities focused on medical conditions that are the same as, or similar to, those targeted by us. In particular, another treatment was approved by the FDA for LN approximately one month before we received approval for LUPKYNIS, and physicians have and continue to treat LN in the United States using other drugs with off-label prescribing, such as a combination of MMF and steroids or tacrolimus. Many of biotechnology companies that could or do compete with us or our products have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staff, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organization than we do. Many of these companies have significant experience in pre-clinical testing, human clinical trials, product manufacturing, marketing and distribution, and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, colleges, universities, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations conduct research and may market commercial products on their own or through collaborative agreements and these institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed. These companies, institutions, and organizations also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel, as well as other personnel needed for our business. Certain products may also be available at prices that are substantially lower than the cost of LUPKYNIS, whether or not studied in, or receiving approval for use by the FDA for, LN.
We believe key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of LUPKYNIS and future potential product candidates include, but are not limited to, efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, pricing, the level of generic competition and reimbursement. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect that we may become subject to additional competition.
REGULATORY
We worked with Otsuka to prepare an MAA filing with the EMA that was filed during the first half of 2021 and an MAA filing with Swissmedic that was filed during the second half of 2021. Otsuka has also taken on customary obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and submit filings for regulatory approvals in the other territories in which we have granted them rights, including Japan and selected other European countries.
Regulatory Requirements
The development, manufacturing and marketing of LUPKYNIS is subject to regulations relating to the demonstration of safety and efficacy of the products as established by the government or regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions where this product is to be marketed. We, or our licensees, are required to seek and obtain regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan in order to commercialize LUPKYNIS in these jurisdictions. Depending upon the circumstances surrounding the clinical evaluation of LUPKYNIS, we may undertake clinical trials, contract clinical trial activities to contract research organizations, or rely upon corporate partners for such development. As noted above, we have obtained the requisite approvals for LUPKYNIS to treat active LN in adult patients in the United States. We believe this approach will allow us to make cost effective developmental decisions in a timely fashion. We cannot predict or give any assurances as to whether regulatory approvals will be received or how long the process of seeking regulatory approvals will take.
Although only the jurisdictions of the United States, Europe and Japan are discussed in this section, we may also seek regulatory approval in other jurisdictions in the future and may initiate other clinical studies if and where appropriate.
Government Regulation
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, 
results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to product development and approval, business acquisitions, healthcare, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
United States—FDA Process 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
Drug Approval Process. No drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following: 
•completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s GLP requirements and other applicable regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug substance and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current GMPs; and 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. 
Clinical trials involve administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as part of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. There are also requirements governing reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. 
Clinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred 
to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
Furthermore, the sponsor, the FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, such as in the circumstances where the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 clinical testing, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach consensus on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support submission of an NDA. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of pre-clinical studies and of clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is GMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to a filing review before the FDA accepts it for filing and substantive review. 
The FDA also may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug and/or its drug substance is manufactured and may withhold approval of the product if the manufacturing is not in compliance with GMPs and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data and/or additional 
pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA could approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA approves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. 
Expedited Review and Approval. The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing certain drugs and in the case of accelerated approval, provide for approval on the basis of surrogate or intermediate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
For example, fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such diseases or conditions. With regard to a fast track-designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
Drug products intended for serious or life threatening conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies receive all the benefits of a fast track designation, as well as intensive guidance on efficient drug development and organizational commitment involving senior managers in the FDA. 
Post-Approval Requirements. After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 
If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to GMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with GMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. We use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We have filed for a patent term extension for one of our U.S. patents, which is being considered by the USPTO. Only one U.S. patent is permitted to be extended for the currently approved drug product and its uses. 
Data and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent or from accepting and reviewing an application referencing the approved drug’s application. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
Foreign Regulation 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we may become subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of LUPKYNIS or other potential future products. In many cases, we must obtain approval of the country’s regulatory authorities in order to conduct clinical trials or market products, although in selected countries there are regulations that permit marketing a product on the basis of an approval that has been received in the US, EU, or elsewhere. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
As an example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of MAs: 
•Community MAs – These are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA; for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation; or for products that are in the interest of public health in the EU.
•National MAs – These are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state. The competent authority of the reference member state prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other member states (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the reference member state, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the member states, i.e., in the reference member state and the member states concerned. 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA assess the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic product. For example, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the EEA, we expect they will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), we (or our licensee or partner) obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EEA and prevents generics from relying on the marketing authorization holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of eight years. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted, and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. However, a generic cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. 
When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent Member State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial. In April 2014, the EU passed the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014), which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all EU member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 
until the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. According to the current plans of the EMA, the Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to become applicable in December 2021. 
Japan Regulatory Process
In Japan, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) is the main regulatory agency that oversees the review and approval of the drugs in Japan. There is the potential for PMDA to require additional clinical trials to be conducted to generate data in a Japanese population.
Japan’s regulatory system requires the Japanese New Drug Application (J-NDA) documents to be prepared in the common technical document format. Once the applicant files the J-NDA, PMDA reviews the application and may carry out a GMP investigation of manufacturing site. If there are any major issues, PMDA reviewer will prepare a summary of the main issues, discuss with the applicant and may organize an expert discussion, which involves a discussion between the PMDA reviewer and external expert on the proposed major issue(s). 
Following this review meeting, PMDA may again hold another expert discussion (if necessary) and prepares a review report for final approval within the Japanese government. The standard time for approval of a J-NDA is approximately 12 months. In Japan, our products may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for such regulatory exclusivity, or that such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and internationally, sales of LUPKYNIS and any other products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. These organizations routinely implement cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives that have the ability, or potential, to impact a patient’s overall access to our product. Examples of these initiatives include, but are not limited to, establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that are eligible for reimbursement and the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products.
In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts, rebates and/or other price concessions to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted to potentially impact reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products in which we have a commercial interest.
Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA) enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the ACA established:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
•a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts for eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, often referred to as the donut hole; and
•a formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental (federal and state) scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, 
review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
Similar political, economic and regulatory developments are occurring in the EU and may affect the ability of pharmaceutical companies to profitably commercialize their products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the ability of pharmaceutical companies to commercialize their products. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.
In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system and international healthcare systems. Future legislation, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The adoption of certain proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, and limit the acceptance and availability of our products. Therefore, substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products by third-party payors.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN
In order to supply commercial inventory for LUPKYNIS, we have established relationships with contract manufacturing organizations or CMOs, coupled with supply agreements, for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient or drug substance, encapsulation of voclosporin 7.9 mg capsules as well as packaging of LUPKYNIS commercial cartons.
Manufacturing of Drug Substance
Voclosporin requires a specialized drug substance manufacturing process and is manufactured by Lonza, our sole supplier for drug substance. Pricing for supply is determined through supply agreements between us and Lonza and is based on the kilograms produced and the cost of the raw materials used in the drug substance manufacturing process. As at the date of this Annual Report, we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining the raw materials required with respect to the manufacturing of voclosporin. We believe we have enough inventory on hand and manufacturing capacity to meet forecasted demand.
We have entered into a collaborative agreement with Lonza to build a dedicated manufacturing capacity within Lonza’s existing small molecule facility in Visp, Switzerland. The dedicated facility (also referred to as monoplant) will be equipped with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment to provide cost and production efficiencies for the manufacture of voclosporin, while expanding existing capacity and providing supply security to meet future commercial demand. Upon completion of the monoplant, we will have the right to maintain unobstructed use of the monoplant by paying a quarterly fixed facility fee.
Encapsulation
Catalent Pharma Solutions (Catalent) is currently the sole supplier for the preparation of our voclosporin 7.9 mg capsules. Pricing for these services is determined by a supply agreement between Catalent and us. We expect that Catalent will continue to provide contract manufacturing services with respect to encapsulating voclosporin in order to manufacture voclosporin 7.9 mg capsules that are required for our future commercial and clinical supply needs.
Packaging
We currently use a sole supplier for the packaging of LUPKYNIS commercial cartons. Pricing for these services is determined by a supply agreement between us and our supplier. We expect that our supplier will continue to provide contract manufacturing services with respect to the packaging of LUPKYNIS commercial cartons for the U.S. market.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have built a world class commercial organization with deep expertise and a focus on rheumatology and nephrology to support the commercialization of LUPKYNIS. The commercial team consists of sales, marketing, commercial operations, commercial supply chain, patient services, market access, and professional and advocacy relations. 
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 300 employees across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, all of whom are expected to be guided by our vision and values and by an underlying set of ethical principles. We are committed to treating each of our employees fairly, and to maintaining employment practices based on equal opportunity for all employees. We respect each other’s privacy and treat each other with dignity and respect irrespective of age, race, color, sex, sexual preference, nationality, or physical condition. We are committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions and an atmosphere of open communication for all of our employees.
While the compensation committee of our board of directors has the primary responsibility of overseeing our human capital management activities (including assessing the effectiveness of employee programs and advising management with regard to establishing our strategic goals and overall human resource strategies), other committees also have responsibilities that impact our human capital management as outlined in their respective charters. Within management, our human resources function has global management responsibility for advising and assisting the business on human resource matters and executing our overall human capital management strategies.
We strive to engage and retain our employees throughout the employment life-cycle with effective recruiting and onboarding; competitive pay, benefits and other total rewards; programs for professional development and career advancement; compliance training; succession planning; and a safe, healthy and respectful workplace. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented safety and health standards and protocols for our employees while continuing to offer a safe environment as an essential service to our customers. We have been responsive to local guidelines in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included in 2021 shutting our offices for part of the year and having our employees work from home, re-opening in deliberate fashion following local guidelines, and installing COVID-19 plans and policies to be followed at our offices (including mask protocols, and limitations on attendance in common spaces). Our offices are provided with personal protective equipment, other equipment and enhanced cleaning supplies, and are required to adhere to appropriate protocols for social distancing, limiting density, reporting and documenting exposures and wearing masks at all times, all as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control or mandated by local regulations.
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
All of our employees are required to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. It is the responsibility of all of our employees to comply with our Code of Conduct and to report any actual or suspected misconduct, illegal activities or fraud. To that end, employees are encouraged to report any such activities to their supervisor or our Chief Compliance Officer. We also maintain a whistleblower hotline that is available to all of our employees to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline (which is facilitated by an independent third party) are routed to our General Counsel (or, if the General Counsel is the subject of the communication, to the Chair of our Audit Committee) for investigation and resolution. We also maintain a policy of no retaliation, where employees who report any misconduct are to be free of any harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequence.
