Item 1. Business.
General
The Company is a national specialty retailer of apparel for women and tween girls. The Company's operations consist of its direct channel operations and approximately 3,400 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico as of August 3, 2019. The Company had annual revenues for Fiscal 2019 of approximately $5.5 billion. 
Enterprise Transformation
Operational-related transformation
Retailers, especially those in the specialty apparel sector, continue to face intense competition, particularly as consumer spending habits continue to indicate an increasing preference to purchase digitally as opposed to in traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. This preference has resulted in increased direct channel sales, but has continued to put pressure on our retail store sales. As a result of these fundamental changes, we are continuing our previously announced strategic review of our brands and operations with the goal to enhance shareholder value. We believe that structural and strategic changes are necessary to successfully compete in the changing retail landscape.

To that end, over the past few years, the Company has undergone an extensive transformation of its business. This transformation began during Fiscal 2017, when the Company announced that it was beginning a multi-year transformation plan with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing shareholder value (the "Change for Growth" program). Actions completed under this long-term transformation focused on (i) refinements to the Company's operating model to increase the focus on key customer segments, (ii) developing initiatives designed to optimize the flow of product through the Company's distribution channels, including its direct channel and its brick-and-mortar retail locations, including areas related to markdown optimization, size pack optimization and localized inventory planning, (iii) consolidating certain support functions into shared services, including Human Resources, Real Estate, Non-Merchandise Procurement, and Asset Protection, (iv) transitioning certain transaction processing functions to an independent third-party managed-service provider, and (v) optimizing its store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of under-performing stores through either rent reductions or store closures, in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store portfolio and convert sales from these stores into direct channel sales or to nearby store locations. The Company realized cumulative savings of approximately $290 million from the Change for Growth program through the end of Fiscal 2019, substantially all of which are reflected in the results of our continuing operations, and which have served to offset ongoing inflationary pressure and required reinvestment to support key incremental business initiatives. 
The Company will continue to focus on identifying additional cost reduction opportunities to right-size the cost structure. In the third quarter of Fiscal 2019, we announced an incremental cost reduction target and on June 4, 2019, we actioned our initial round of savings towards achieving that target with the goal of realizing the majority of the anticipated savings in Fiscal 2020. We will continue to formulate plans and take actions to achieve the remainder of that target and look for additional opportunities. These opportunities represent a critical component of our enterprise transformation.
Structural-related transformation
On May 6, 2019, the Company and Maurices Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“maurices”) and wholly owned subsidiary of ascena, completed the transaction contemplated by the previously-announced Stock Purchase Agreement with Viking Brand Upper Holdings, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“Viking”) and an affiliate of OpCapita LLP, providing for, among other things, the sale by ascena of maurices to Viking (the “Transaction”). Effective upon the closing of the Transaction, ascena received cash proceeds of approximately $210 million and a 49.6% ownership interest in the operations of maurices, consisting of interests in Viking preferred and common stock. 
On May 20, 2019, the Company announced the wind down of its Dressbarn brand. The wind down is currently expected to be completed in the first half of Fiscal 2020. During Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded severance, professional fees, and non-cash asset impairments and currently expects to incur additional wind down costs during the first half of Fiscal 2020, primarily related to severance, inventory liquidation and closure of Dressbarn retail stores. As a result of these actions, once the wind down of Dressbarn is complete, the Company will have exited its Value Fashion segment. 
On May 1, 2019 the Company announced changes to its senior leadership team. These changes included the retirement of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the departure of the Company's Chief Operating Officer, as well as the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer and Interim Executive Chair of the Board. On August 4, 2019 the Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer upon the resignation of the former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We believe that these changes will continue to support our structure-related transformation activities as the new management team seeks additional ways to optimize our brand portfolio and distribution framework which will allow us to better compete in the changing retail landscape.

In connection with the Company's efforts to right-size the cost structure, the Company conducted a strategic review of its store fleet with the goal of improving overall profitability and cash flows of its store portfolio. The Company launched its fleet optimization program in January of 2017, with an annualized savings target of $50 million through rent concessions and closure of stores. In Fiscal 2018, the Company expanded its total annualized savings target to $60 million. As of the end of Fiscal 2019, the program has generated total annualized savings to our continuing operations in excess of the $60 million target. The Company will continue to seek opportunities to optimize its store portfolio and achieve rent reductions whenever possible. 
Trademarks

The Company has U.S. Trademark Registration Certificates and trademark applications pending for the operating names of the Company's stores and its major private label merchandise brands. The Company believes its trademarks such as ANN TAYLOR®, LOFT®, ANN TAYLOR LOFT®, LOU & GREY®, JUSTICE®, LANE BRYANT®, CACIQUE®, CATHERINES®, and "&®" are essential to the continued success of its business. The Company intends to maintain its trademarks and related registrations and vigorously protect them against infringement.

Additionally, as of August 3, 2019, Justice and LOFT had 80 and 5 international franchise stores, respectively, operated under franchise agreements where we earn licensing revenue. International revenue from company-operated stores and franchised stores accounts for approximately 2% of consolidated annual net sales. 
Sourcing

The Company's brands source their products through one of three channels - ascena's internal sourcing group, third-party buying agents, or directly from market vendors. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed to market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.
Operating through offices located in South Korea, China, India and Bangladesh, the Company maintains direct relationships with manufacturing partners, enabling desired product quality control and speed to market, along with favorable pricing as compared to market vendors. 
Merchandise Vendors

The Company purchases its merchandise from many domestic and foreign suppliers. It has no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of its suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier as no third-party supplier accounts for more than 10% of our merchandise purchases. The Company believes that it has good working relationships with its suppliers.

Merchandising and Design
The Company continues to focus on building its merchandising and design functions to align with its market position. The merchandising and design teams determine inventory needs for the upcoming season in response to fast changing fashion trends and customer preferences. Over the last few years, the Company has made substantial investments to acquire and retain merchandising and design talent allowing it to differentiate its fashion offerings, which it believes is a critical enabler for long-term success. 
Office and Distribution Centers

For a detailed discussion of the Company's office and distribution centers, see Part I, Item 2 “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference herein.
Information Technology Systems

The Company continues to make ongoing investments in its information technology systems to support its strategies in omni-channel, merchandise procurement, inventory management and supply chain. Our information technology systems make the design, marketing, importing and distribution of our products more efficient by providing common platforms for, among other things, order processing, product and design information, and financial information. 
Advertising and Marketing
The Company uses a combination of broad-based and targeted marketing and advertising strategies to effectively define, evolve, and promote our brands. These strategies are designed to deliver a personalized and relevant shopping experience for our customers and include customer research, advertising and promotional events, window and in-store marketing materials, direct mail marketing, Internet and social media marketing, lifestyle magazines, and other means of communication.
Customer Relationship Management
The Company continues to focus on building our customer relationships and promoting customer loyalty through various programs including brand-specific loyalty and credit card programs. Customers shopping at our brands who are enrolled in our loyalty programs earn reward points that are redeemable toward future purchases. Our brands also offer credit card programs to eligible customers providing additional discounts and promotional offers. During Fiscal 2019, the Company launched new loyalty programs at its Premium Fashion and Plus Fashion segments. This follows the rollout of a new loyalty program at the Kids Fashion segment in Fiscal 2018. These programs provide opportunities to attract new customers, retain and enhance existing customer relationships, and deliver a more personalized shopping experience through a better understanding of our customers' preferences and shopping behaviors. 
Community Service
ascena and its brands have a rich history of giving. Together, the Company has a shared commitment to our associates and the women and girls whom we serve.

More information about our charitable giving, including the non-profit partners we support, is available at www.ascenaretail.com.
Competition
The retail apparel industry is highly competitive and increasingly fragmented. The Company competes with numerous retailers, including department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and Internet-based retailers, on pricing, styles and fulfillment capability. Our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts, channel shifts and changes in customer preferences. Some of our competitors operate at a lower cost structure, and are able to offer better pricing; others have more sophisticated direct channel or omni-channel capabilities. Examples of our competitive set include but are not limited to Gap Inc., Amazon, Walmart, Macy’s, JCPenney, Target and TJX Companies. Other competitors may enter the markets we serve. If the Company fails to compete successfully, it could face continued sales declines and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability. The Company is working aggressively to differentiate our brands and our assortments to reinforce the
