 Overview 
     eGain is an innovative software-as-a service (SaaS) provider of customer engagement solutions in a digital world, with operations in the US, UK and India. Business-to-Consumer (B2C) brands quickly operationalize customer engagement strategy on our feature rich, comprehensive, and open platform to optimize experience for Agents, Businesses, and Customers. Connected artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge and analytics capabilities automate self-service across touch points and augment a digital-first, omnichannel agent desktop to reduce service cost, increase upsell, and improve business agility. Hundreds of customers around the world, primarily in financial services, telco, retail, government, healthcare and utilities, rely on eGain to provide a unified customer engagement hub.
     In fiscal year 2017, we completed our transition from a hybrid model where we sold both SaaS and perpetual license solutions to a SaaS only business model (SaaS Transition). Today we only sell SaaS to new clients and are actively migrating our remaining perpetual license clients to SaaS. As we continue to migrate our legacy perpetual license clients to SaaS, we expect our non-SaaS recurring revenue, primarily comprising annual maintenance and support fees for legacy perpetual license clients, to continue to decline.
     Our go-forward SaaS business model affords us recurring revenue visibility and more predictability. Our SaaS clients adopt our product innovation much faster in the perpetual license model and enjoy better service levels. Finally, we believe SaaS clients enjoy up to 50% faster time to value from their eGain investment.
     Industry Background 
     Introduction
     Traditional CRM tools do not serve the needs of the digital world because they were designed primarily as systems of record to capture, view, and report on customer data in a phone-centric environment. They do not offer rich applications to engage customers across digital-first touch points nor escalate with full context across self-service to agent assistance. They view knowledge management as document management (a monolithic content model that struggles in the personalized, media-rich, and content-heavy digital world). In the CRM world, agents are presumed to have a high capacity to retain and update relevant knowhow across complex product portfolios in their head (with extensive training and retraining). Finally, in-band process guidance for self-service and agent assistance are foreign to the traditional CRM world. Agents struggle with no guidance in that world; they just get lost with data on their screens. The reality of contact centers today is that we believe agents ignore 90% of available data on their screens – most of it hidden in multiple tabs – as they merely refer to post-it notes or internal chat sessions to find the right answer for a customer. It is time for change.     Digital Economy Demands Modern Software
     In a world selling commoditized products to information-rich customers short on time, smart customer engagement reduces cognitive effort. And easy customer engagements build sticky brand and boost profit. As a result, businesses are actively seeking digital-first, modern software platforms to layer on top of their traditional systems of record like CRM. These platforms must be agile, comprehensive, scalable, and cost-effective to help automate customer self-service, augment agent productivity and orchestrate contact center operation in an omnichannel environment.     AI-powered Customer Engagement Automation
     Energized in the digital world by big-data, cloud-computing and open-source technologies, AI and Machine Learning can deliver transformational value when effectively combined with domain expertise and complementary technologies like knowledge, analytics, and digital. In customer engagement, the ultimate goal is automation delivered on a platform that combines these powerful capabilities in a purpose-built way. The pressing challenge for businesses is to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the face of intense marketing from hundreds of providers – from IBM on the high end to countless startups – businesses now demand proof at scale, no-risk trials in a production setting, and outcome-based pricing tied to business-relevant metrics.

 Contact Centers are the Battleground
     Contact centers offer a significant opportunity to automate human effort in B2C businesses. Globally, there are more than 10 million contact center agents. Even as digital technologies help improve self-service, time-starved customers faced with sophisticated, connected products generate stubbornly high levels of request for human assistance. The possibility of reducing significant headcount expense through automation is compelling for businesses. Furthermore, contact centers worldwide are undergoing a technology refresh cycle from on-premise voice-centric models to cloud-based omnichannel platforms. This transition affords the opportunity to reimagine the traditional centralized, phone-based contact handling operations and move toward much greater automation of customer engagement, fueled by AI and digital technologies.
     Customer Engagement Automation is a Large, Growing Market
     Businesses and organizations of all sizes are investing heavily in digital transformation. According to a preeminent strategy firm, customer engagement is the #1 area of investment in digital transformation. Ease of innovation in cloud and a growing API economy present ever more exciting capability dots for enterprise to connect and operate. This is both an opportunity and a challenge. A premier IT analyst firm estimates that by 2022 approximately 72% of all customer interactions will involve emerging technology such as machine-learning applications, chatbots or mobile messaging compared to approximately 11% in 2017. To harness these disruptive and novel capabilities, businesses are looking toward innovative platform providers with proof at scale to deliver a solution.
     The eGain Approach and Benefits
     What Customers Want
     Technology acceleration notwithstanding, human needs for customer engagement and service change very slowly. What customers want is help in three categories: information, transaction, and situational. And any given customer contact can move across these needs as the conversation develops. Therefore, it is critical that an effective solution address these three types of interactions seamlessly and with context - accounting for machine-human hand-offs, channel switching, multimodal interaction, and conversational pause-and-resume. In each of these interactions, customers increasingly want to be guided, even anticipated, because time efficiency is their #1 goal after a correct answer is their biggest hurdle to a good experience, according to analyst surveys and our own research.     The eGain Solution 
     eGain offers a comprehensive, unified cloud software solution to automate, augment and orchestrate customer engagement in a digital-first omnichannel world. Our feature rich portfolio of applications empowers businesses to holistically, flexibly, and continuously optimize the experience for agents, business and customers. Our solution experts and partners guide clients on a customer engagement transformation journey using an agile, strategy-aligned set of sprints to activate waves of cooperating capabilities in phases. Each sprint is measured with our analytics to surface business value, justifying the next phase of investment.     Digital-first, Omnichannel Desktop
     First, our solution offers comprehensive, scalable capabilities for digital-first, omnichannel interaction within a modern, purpose-built desktop. Rich, out of the box applications help agents efficiently interact with customers using messaging, SMS, chat, email, social media, phone, video, fax, and letter to enable connected customer journeys, offering service across all touch points. Our enterprise-grade digital engagement capabilities are proven at scale with clients such as a leading telco that annually serves over 12 million digital customer interactions with over five thousand agents on a 24x7 basis.
     AI and Knowledge Applications
     Next, our solution offers powerful AI and Knowledge applications for virtual assistance for customers and agents. These applications enable businesses to centralize knowledge, policies, procedures, and best-practices, while delivering guided, personalized solutions to customers and agents. These applications are designed to ensure that all agents in an organization 

 
  5

 
can effectively handle all types of contacts, regardless of product or procedure. Consistent and correct responses across all touchpoints (operated by the previous layer of omnichannel applications) significantly improve customer satisfaction even as first contact resolution rates surge and an agent’s time to competency drops. Our AI and Knowledge applications deliver compelling value through large-scale self-service automation. For instance, one of our healthcare clients serves over 25 million requests every year with web self-service. Another client improved customer NPS scores by 20 points and boosted First Contact Resolution by 23% using our AI and Knowledge capabilities in a ten thousand agent customer service operation.
     Analytics and Machine Learning Applications
     Our powerful analytics capability enables clients to measure, manage and orchestrate their omnichannel service operations. In addition, our recently announced machine learning service helps clients generate product improvement and customer preference insights from all of their customer conversation data and also identify opportunities to automate more processes.
     Open, secure APIs and pre-built, certified third-party connectors
     Our open, secure platform APIs are available to clients and partners to extend and enhance our solutions and to integrate with enterprise assets and to enable a single view of the customer. Our deep, certified connectors into platforms such as those of Avaya, Amazon.com, Cisco and Salesforce.com enable our clients to leverage their existing systems of record and communication, while building their system of engagement on the eGain platform.
     Compelling Benefits
     We believe our solution delivers transformational value as clients develop their modern customer engagement capabilities on our platform. Specifically, our solutions allow clients to:

 Transformative value delivered at scale across large, diversified customer base
     Our solution delivers transformative value at scale today across a large, diversified customer base. We believe that our understanding of the customer need and our ability to fulfil it at scale and with enterprise-grade sophistication is unmatched. From sixty thousand agents at a healthcare client using our solution on a 24x7 basis to a P&C insurer with fifteen thousand contact center advisors and thirty-thousand field agents, we are the preferred choice for the large brands looking to automate customer engagement.
     Innovation at the core drives an easy consumption model
     For over twenty years we have anticipated technology and market trends and sought to consistently stay ahead of them. We anticipated the need for AI in customer service in 2000, and we developed an omnichannel customer engagement hub over a decade ago. With a relentless focus on the customer engagement automation market, we continue to add capabilities designed to enhance our client’s investment in eGain. Recently, we added new customer messaging capabilities via Apple Business Chat, Facebook Messenger, and SMS. Also, we launched our new VA 3.0, a third-generation virtual assistant powered by AI, Machine Learning, and Knowledge that is seamlessly connected with the omnichannel assistance capabilities of the eGain platform. This ability to connect dots quickly across new and existing technology capabilities, within the eGain platform and outside, distinguishes us when presenting to clients looking for quick value on a platform that can handle their future needs.
     Not only do we seek to innovate more quickly than others, we stand behind our claim with a unique Try+Buy™ offer – a 30-day guided production pilot in the eGain Cloud with no strings attached. Along similar lines, we recently launched another exciting offer, “AI Value in 30 days,” to help clients make better choices as they invest in AI technologies to automate their customer engagement operation.
     Leveraged go-to-market strategy with a growing partner ecosystem
     We take our solutions to market through a partner-leveraged enterprise sales model. Our enterprise sales team works closely with our channel managers to help partners qualify and sell. Our key channel partner today is Cisco. Through its partner ecosystem and direct sales network, we resell cloud-based, eGain-branded solutions in our target geographies of North America and Europe. Given the reach of Cisco and its partners in the enterprise, we see growing opportunities in this ecosystem.
     In the second half of fiscal 2018, we also announced a partnership with Avaya as part of its AI Connect program. This recent engagement is beginning to result in opportunities. Also, in late fiscal 2018, we announced a deep integration with Amazon Connect, a disruptive cloud-based contact center proposition. Finally, at our Digital+AI Day in London in May 2018, we announced an eGain developer portal for partners and clients to integrate with and add value to the eGain platform.
     Customers 
     We serve a worldwide customer base across a wide variety of industry sectors, including healthcare, retail, telecommunications, financial services, insurance, outsourced services, technology, utilities, government, manufacturing and consumer electronics. Our product is sold primarily to large B2C enterprises, which we define as enterprises with over $500 million in annual revenue. For fiscal year 2018, domestic and international revenue accounted for 52% and 48% of total revenue, respectively, compared to 49% and 51%, and 50% and 50%, for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Our largest customer, Cisco Systems, Inc., accounted for 16% of total revenue in fiscal year 2018 and 13% of total revenue in fiscal year 2017. Our two largest customers, Cisco Systems, Inc. and State Farm Insurance Company, accounted for 14% and 10%, respectively, of total revenue in fiscal year 2016. 
     Competition 
     We compete with other application software vendors including Genesys Telecommunications, LivePerson, Inc., and Moxie Software, Inc. In addition, we face actual or potential competition from larger software companies such as Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com, Inc., and Verint KANA that may attempt to sell customer engagement

software to their installed base. We also compete with internally developed applications within large enterprises. Finally, we face, or expect to face, competition from software vendors who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers’ infrastructure or as hosted services. The market that we compete in is highly competitive and some of our competitors may have longer operating histories, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, greater engineering and technical resources, greater sales and marketing resources, stronger strategic partnerships and distribution channels, larger user bases, products and services with different functions and feature sets and greater brand recognition than we have. 
     We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
    
· | proven track record of customer success;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | speed and ease of implementation;
--+----------------------------------


· | product functionality;
--+-----------------------


· | financial stability and viability of the vendor;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | product adoption;
--+------------------


· | ease of use and rates of user adoption;
--+----------------------------------------


· | low total cost of ownership and demonstrable cost-effective benefits for customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of the service;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | whether the software is delivered via the cloud or on-premises;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | ease of integration with existing applications;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | quality of customer support;
--+-----------------------------


· | availability and quality of implementation, consulting and training services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | vendor reputation and brand awareness.
--+---------------------------------------

      Growth Strategy
     We intend to scale our business by executing the following programs.
     Migrate legacy on-premise customers to eGain Cloud
     Since we transitioned our business to SaaS, we have continued to actively migrate legacy on-premise customers to the eGain Cloud. We offer an attractive proposition to our on-premise customers to move to the eGain Cloud where we subsidize the services cost in migrating them to the eGain Cloud in exchange for their multi-year commitment to the eGain Cloud. At the end of fiscal 2018, we still had quarterly support revenue from a number of our on-premise customers. We expect to migrate most of these customers, subject to typical attrition, to the eGain Cloud over the next two years.
     Land and Expand in the enterprise
     With the progress we have made in customer success over recent periods, we see a replicable pattern emerging: land enterprise logos with a potentially limited footprint in one business unit, demonstrate business value, and then actively expand in the enterprise – activating more of our capabilities and rolling out to multiple business units. Further, we see the opportunity to increase stickiness by integrating via our enhanced APIs with enterprise assets like enterprise collaboration platforms, CRM systems, transaction and billing, and content sources.
     Develop new partner relationships
     As a business today, we have an abundance of product solutions but limited distribution. We are well positioned to enable existing technology platforms with a strong installed customer base to enhance their proposition with AI-powered customer engagement solutions. We intend to continue to develop partnerships to grow our market share.

 Enter the mid-market
     We ran a successful experiment in the US market in fiscal 2018 where we acquired new customers and followed up with rapid customer success that yielded add-on sales opportunities. Based on this success, we plan to increase our investment in the mid-market (sub 100 contact center seats) in the US in the 2019 fiscal year.
     Maintain platform innovation leadership
     Innovation is in our DNA and we plan to continue to build on our strength. We plan to invest in easy-to-consume innovation with more compelling user experiences and more extensive platform APIs, so that in working with partners we can deliver differentiated and sustained value to clients.
     Selectively pursue acquisitions
     Historically, we have from time to time pursued inorganic strategies to strengthen our product portfolio. Our most recent was in 2014 when we acquired Exony Limited, a provider of advanced contact analytics software. Moving forward, we will continue to look for possible combinations that we believe will deliver compelling value to our clients.
     Sales and Marketing
     Sales Strategy 
     Our sales strategy is to pursue targeted accounts, mostly B2C enterprises, through a combination of our direct sales force and partners. We target our sales efforts at enterprise companies. These enterprises have thousands of customer service agents in their contact centers and, in the aggregate, communicate with billions of customers each year. We attempt to utilize thought leadership and other marketing events to demonstrate our leadership position in the cloud-based customer engagement software market and highlight our successes with existing customers. Our North American direct sales organization is based at our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, with field sales presences throughout the United States. Internationally, we have offices in India and the United Kingdom. 
     The direct sales force is organized into teams that include field sales representatives and sales consultants. Our direct sales force is complemented by lead generation representatives and sales development representatives. 
     We also complement our direct sales force with reseller and sales alliances. We believe we are able to leverage additional sales, marketing and deployment capabilities through these alliances. 
     Marketing and Partner Strategy 
     Our marketing strategy is to build our brand around innovative and robust products trusted by leading enterprises. Our marketing organization focuses on public relations, analyst relations, marketing communications and demand generation. We employ a wide range of marketing avenues to deliver our message, including print and Internet advertising, targeted electronic and postal mailing, email newsletters, and a variety of trade shows, seminars, webinars, and interest groups. 
     Our marketing group also produces sales tools, including product collateral, customer case studies, demonstrations, presentations, and competitive analyses. In addition, the group performs market analyses and customer reviews to identify and develop key partnership opportunities and product capabilities. 
     We believe that our partners help extend the breadth and depth of our product offerings, drive market penetration, and augment our professional service capabilities. We believe these relationships are important to delivering successful, integrated products and services to our customers, and scaling our business. Our partner portal, EcoNet™, enables us to provide comprehensive sales, support and services information for channel partners, while enabling them to collaborate with one another through an online forum. Partner enablement is also a key focus area for our consulting and training teams.

 As of June 30, 2018, we had 69 employees engaged in worldwide sales and marketing activities.
     Subscription Services 
     Our subscription services provide customers with access to our software within a cloud-based information technology (IT) 
 environment that we manage and offer on a subscription basis. These subscription services allow our customers to benefit from our latest cloud innovations and to reduce infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration requirements. We also offer cloud-based services to existing customers who previously purchased licenses to our software to access that software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage. This reduces infrastructure and ongoing administration requirements as an alternative to their on- premises deployment of our software. We generally offer these services via 36 month contracts with pricing based on the number of agents and/or customer service sessions.     Consulting and Education 
     Our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting and education services designed to facilitate customer success and build customer loyalty.
    
· | Consulting Services. Our consulting services group offers rapid implementation services, custom solution development, and systems integration services. Consultants work with customers to understand their specific requirements, analyze their business needs, and implement integrated solutions. We provide these services independently or in partnership with systems integrators who have developed consulting expertise on our platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Education Services. Our education services group provides a comprehensive set of basic and customized training programs to our customers and partners in addition to online tutorial modules for ongoing refresher courses. Training programs are offered either in-person at the customer site, or at one of our worldwide training centers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As of June 30, 2018, we had 96 professionals providing worldwide services for systems installation, solutions development, application management, and education.
     Customer Support 
     We offer a comprehensive collection of support services designed to rapidly respond to inquiries. Our technical support services are available to customers worldwide under maintenance and support agreements. The customer success team uses eGain’s own software suite to provide world-class service to all our customers through support centers located in California, the United Kingdom, and India. 
     As of June 30, 2018, there were 64 employees engaged in worldwide customer support services and 41 employees engaged in worldwide cloud services and maintenance support.
     Research and Development
     The market for our products changes rapidly and is characterized by evolving industry standards, swift changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of maintaining technology leadership. This includes enhancing current technology, providing excellent quality, performance, and functionality, as well as developing additional applications, and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. 
     We continuously analyze market and customer requirements and evaluate external technology that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, increase our lifetime customer value or expand our target market. As a result of this process, we acquired Exony Limited, a leader in enterprise contact center analytics software, in August 2014.  
     As of June 30, 2018, we had 136 employees engaged in worldwide product development activities. We spent approximately $14.7 million, $13.8 million and $16.1 million on research and development in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

     Intellectual Property 
     We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on intellectual property and other laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business.
 As of June 30, 2018, we had 11 issued patents in the United States. In addition, we have a number of pending patent applications in the United States, including one provisional filing and several non‑provisional filings. Our issued U.S. patents expire at various times between 2029 and 2035.
     We continually assess the propriety of seeking intellectual property protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Future applications may or may not receive the issuance of valid patents or registered trademarks. 
     We routinely require our employees, customers, and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our products, technology, or business plans. In addition, we require employees to agree to surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, some of our license agreements with certain customers and partners require us to place the source code for our products into escrow. These agreements typically provide that some party will have a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use this code as authorized by the license agreement if there is a bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against us, or if we materially breach a contractual commitment to provide support and maintenance to the party. 
     Employees 
     As of June 30, 2018, we had 464 full-time employees, of which 136 were in product development, 201 in services and support, 69 in sales and marketing, and 58 in finance and administration. 
     None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we believe our relations with our employees are good, our future performance depends largely upon the continued service of our key technical, sales and marketing, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by employment agreements requiring service for a defined period of time.
