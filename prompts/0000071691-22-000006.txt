ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
The New York Times Company (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 26, 1896, under the laws of the State of New York. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “our” and “us.”
We are a global media organization focused on creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information that helps our audience understand and engage with the world. We believe that The Times’s original, independent and high-quality reporting, storytelling and journalistic excellence across topics and formats set us apart from other news organizations and is at the heart of what makes our journalism worth paying for. The quality of our coverage has been widely recognized with many industry and peer accolades, including 132 Pulitzer Prizes and citations, more than any other news organization.
The Company includes our digital and print products and related businesses, including:
•our core news product, The New York Times (“The Times”), which is available on our mobile applications, on our website (NYTimes.com) and as a printed newspaper, and associated content such as our podcasts;
•our other interest-specific products, including Games, Cooking and Audm (our read-aloud audio service), which are available on mobile applications and websites; Wirecutter, our online review and recommendation product; and, following our acquisition of The Athletic Media Company on February 1, 2022 (as further described below), The Athletic; and
•our related businesses, such as our licensing operations; our commercial printing operations; our live events business; and other products and services under The Times brand.
On February 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of The Athletic Media Company (“The Athletic”), a global digital subscription-based sports media business that provides national and local coverage of more than 200 clubs and teams in the United States and around the world.
We generate revenues principally from the sale of subscriptions and advertising. Subscription revenues consist of revenues from subscriptions to our digital and print products (which include our news product, as well as our Games, Cooking, Audm and Wirecutter products) and single-copy and bulk sales of our print products. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of our advertising products and services. Revenue information for the Company appears under “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY – P. 1


We believe that the significant growth in subscriptions to our products demonstrates the success of our “subscription-first” strategy and the willingness of our readers to pay for high-quality journalism. As of December 26, 2021, approximately 7.6 million subscribers had purchased approximately 8.8 million paid subscriptions across our products, more than at any point in our history. Our non-news products Games and Cooking each crossed one million subscriptions just before the end of 2021. 
In early 2019, we established a goal of reaching 10 million subscriptions by 2025, a target we have now surpassed with the acquisition of The Athletic in 2022. In February 2022, we announced a new target: at least 15 million total subscribers by year-end 2027.
During 2021, we continued to make significant investments in our journalism and our digital product experience as well as in the back-end technology and underlying capabilities that allow users to seamlessly move among various devices and products. The Times continued to break stories, produce investigative reports and help our audience understand a wide range of topics, including the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and its many reverberations, the intersection of race and culture in America, and the varied effects of climate change. In addition, we continue to innovate advertising offerings that integrate well with the user experience, including solutions that use proprietary first-party data — rather than third-party data — to generate predictive insights and help inform our clients’ advertising strategies while leveraging our audiences in privacy-forward ways, as well as our audio advertising offerings. We also expanded subscriptions to our non-news products by launching a subscription option to our Wirecutter product during the third quarter of 2021.
In January 2022, we acquired Wordle, a popular digital word game, to join our Games portfolio.
The global Covid-19 pandemic, efforts to contain it and the resulting economic disruptions have impacted and may further impact our business in various ways. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
PRODUCTS
The Company’s principal business consists of distributing content through our digital and print platforms. In addition, we distribute selected content on third-party platforms. 
Since 2011, we have charged consumers for content provided on our core news website (NYTimes.com) and mobile applications. Digital subscriptions can be purchased by individual consumers or as part of group education or group corporate subscriptions. Our core news access model generally offers users who have registered free access to a limited number of articles before requiring users to subscribe for access to additional content. We have made the choice at times to suspend limits on registered users’ free access to particularly important coverage.
In addition to subscriptions to our digital news product, we offer an All Digital Access subscription package that includes bundled access to our news website and mobile application, Games, Cooking and Wirecutter products. We also offer standalone subscriptions to our Games, Cooking, Audm and Wirecutter products, and effective February 1, 2022, The Athletic. Our access model for our Games, Cooking and Wirecutter products generally offers users who have registered free access to limited pieces of content before requiring users to subscribe for access to additional content.
Our products also include podcasts, which are distributed both on our digital platforms and on third-party platforms. We generate advertising and licensing revenue from this content.
The Times’s print edition newspaper, published seven days a week in the United States, commenced publication in 1851. The Times also has an international edition that is tailored for global audiences. First published in 2013, the international edition succeeded the International Herald Tribune, a leading daily newspaper that commenced publishing in Paris in 1887. Our print newspapers are sold in the United States and around the world through individual home-delivery subscriptions, bulk subscriptions (primarily by schools and hotels) and single-copy sales. Print home-delivery subscribers are entitled to receive free access to our digital news, Games, Cooking and Wirecutter products.

SUBSCRIBERS, SUBSCRIPTIONS AND AUDIENCE
Our content reaches a broad audience through both digital and print platforms. As of December 26, 2021, approximately 7.6 million subscribers had purchased approximately 8,789,000 paid subscriptions across 236 countries and territories to our digital and print products. As of December 31, 2021, The Athletic, which we acquired on February 1, 2022, had approximately 1.2 million subscribers.
Paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 8,005,000 as of December 26, 2021, an increase of approximately 19% compared with December 27, 2020. This amount includes standalone paid subscriptions to our Games, Cooking, Audm and Wirecutter products. International digital-only news subscriptions represented approximately 18% of our digital-only news subscriptions as of December 26, 2021.
The number of paid digital-only subscriptions also includes estimated group education and group corporate subscriptions (which collectively represent approximately 5% of total paid digital subscriptions to our news products). The numbers of paid group subscriptions and subscribers are derived using the value of the relevant contract and a discounted subscription rate. The actual number of users who have access to our products through group sales is substantially higher.
According to comScore Media Metrix, an online audience measurement service, in 2021, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 90 million unique visitors in the United States on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices. Globally, including the United States, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 125 million unique visitors on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices, according to internal data estimates.
In the United States, The Times had the largest daily and Sunday print circulation of all seven-day newspapers for the six-month period ended September 30, 2021, according to data collected by the Alliance for Audited Media (“AAM”), an independent agency that audits circulation of most U.S. newspapers and magazines.
For the fiscal year ended December 26, 2021, The Times’s average print circulation (which includes paid and qualified circulation of the newspaper in print) was approximately 343,000 for weekday (Monday to Friday) and 820,000 for Sunday. (Under AAM’s reporting guidance, qualified circulation represents copies available for individual consumers that are either non-paid or paid by someone other than the individual, such as copies delivered to schools and colleges and copies purchased by businesses for free distribution.)
Average circulation for the international edition of our newspaper (which includes paid circulation of the newspaper in print and electronic replica editions) for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2021, and December 27, 2020, was approximately 91,100 (estimated) and 104,800, respectively. These figures follow the guidance of Office de Justification de la Diffusion, an agency based in Paris and a member of the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations that audits the circulation of most newspapers and magazines in France. For 2020, this guidance excludes data from March through June 2020 in the calculation of the annual average. The final 2021 figure will not be available until April 2022.

ADVERTISING 
We have a comprehensive portfolio of advertising products and services. Advertising revenue is principally from advertisers (such as technology, luxury goods and financial companies) promoting products, services or brands on digital platforms in the form of display ads, audio and video, and in print, in the form of column-inch ads.
The majority of our advertising revenue is derived from offerings sold directly to marketers by our advertising sales teams. A smaller proportion of our total advertising revenues is generated through programmatic auctions run by third-party advertising exchanges. 
Digital advertising includes our core digital advertising business and other digital advertising. Our core digital advertising includes direct-sold website, mobile application, podcast, email and video advertisements. Our digital advertising offerings include solutions that use proprietary first-party data — rather than third-party data — to generate predictive insights and help inform our clients’ advertising strategies while leveraging our audiences in privacy-forward ways. Other digital advertising includes advertising revenues generated by open-market programmatic advertising, creative services associated with branded content, advertisements appearing on our Wirecutter product and classified advertising. In 2021, digital advertising represented approximately 62% of our advertising revenues.
At the time of its acquisition, The Athletic had a limited advertising business, consisting primarily of podcast advertising. We expect to develop a broader set of advertising products and services for the site over time.
Print advertising for The Times includes revenue from column-inch ads and classified advertising, including line-ads as well as preprinted advertising, also known as freestanding inserts. Column-inch ads are priced according to established rates, with premiums for color and positioning, and classified advertising is paid for on a per-line basis. The Times newspaper had the largest market share in 2021 in print advertising among a national newspaper set that consists of USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Times, according to MediaRadar, an independent agency that measures advertising sales volume. In 2021, print advertising represented approximately 38% of our advertising revenues.
Our business is affected in part by seasonal patterns in advertising, with generally higher advertising volume in the fourth quarter due to holiday advertising.
COMPETITION
We face a market undergoing profound transformation and significant competition in all aspects of our business. We compete for audience, subscribers, and advertising against a wide variety of digital and print media companies, including digital and traditional print content providers, news aggregators, search engines, social media platforms and streaming services, any of which might attract audiences and/or advertisers to their platforms and away from ours. Our news product most directly competes for audience, subscriptions and advertising with other U.S. and global news and information digital and print products, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, BBC News, Vox, The Guardian and Financial Times. Our digital news product also competes with customized news feeds, news aggregators and social media products of companies such as Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Twitter. Our other digital products compete with comparable content providers, as well as other digital media of general interest. In addition, we compete for advertising on digital advertising networks and exchanges with real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels.
Competition for subscription revenue and audience is generally based upon content breadth, depth, originality, quality and timeliness; product experience; format; price and access model; visibility on search engines and social media platforms and in mobile application stores; and service, while competition for advertising is generally based upon audience levels and demographics, advertising rates, service, targeting capabilities, advertising results and breadth of advertising offerings. We believe that The Times’s original, independent and high-quality reporting, storytelling and journalistic excellence across topics and formats set us apart from others and is at the heart of what makes our journalism worth paying for, and we believe our journalism attracts valuable audiences providing a safe and trusted platform for advertisers’ brands.

OTHER BUSINESSES
We also derive revenue from other businesses, which primarily include:
•The Company’s licensing of our intellectual property. Our licensing division transmits articles, graphics and photographs from The Times and other publications to over 1,500 clients, including newspapers, magazines and websites in over 95 countries and territories worldwide. The licensing division also handles digital archive distribution, which licenses electronic databases to resellers in the business, professional and library markets; magazine licensing; news digests; book development; and rights and permissions. In addition, the Company licenses select content to third-party digital platforms for access by their users. Finally, the Company licenses content for use in, and collaborates with third parties in the development and production of, television and films;
•In addition to advertising and subscription revenue, our Wirecutter product generates affiliate referral revenue (revenue generated by offering direct links to merchants in exchange for a portion of the sale price upon completion of a transaction); 
•The Company’s commercial printing operations, which utilize excess capacity at our facility in College Point, N.Y., to print and distribute products for third parties; and
•The Company’s live events business, which hosts physical and virtual live events to connect audiences with our journalists and outside thought leaders, and is monetized through sponsorship and advertising. 
PRINT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
The Times is currently printed at our production and distribution facility in College Point, N.Y., as well as under contract at 24 remote print sites across the United States. We also utilize excess capacity at our College Point facility for commercial printing and distribution for third parties. The Times is delivered in the New York metropolitan area through a combination of our own drivers and agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents. In other markets in the United States and Canada, The Times is delivered through agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents.
The international edition of The Times is printed under contract at 28 sites throughout the world and is sold in over 85 countries and territories. It is distributed through agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents.
RAW MATERIALS
The primary raw materials we use are newsprint and coated paper, which we purchase from a number of North American and European producers. A significant portion of our newsprint is purchased from Resolute FP US Inc., a subsidiary of Resolute Forest Products Inc., a large global manufacturer of paper, market pulp and wood products.
In 2021 and 2020, we used the following types and quantities of paper:

(In metric tons) | 2021 | 2020
Newsprint(1) | 63,600 | | 71,600
Coated and Supercalendered Paper(2) | 9,800 | | 10,200

(1) Newsprint usage includes paper used for commercial printing.
(2) The Times uses a mix of coated and supercalendered paper for The New York Times Magazine, and coated paper for T: The New York
Times Style Magazine.

HUMAN CAPITAL
The talented employees who make up our inclusive workplace are vital to the continued success of our mission and business and central to our long-term strategy. In order to attract, develop and maximize the contributions of world-class talent, we are working to create a rewarding employee experience in a variety of ways, including building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace; developing and promoting talent; providing equitable and competitive compensation and benefits (total rewards); and supporting employees’ health, safety and well-being.
Building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace
Each year since 2017, we have prepared an in-depth report on diversity and inclusion at The Times to promote accountability over time. Steps to advance our diversity, equity and inclusion goals include:
•Investing in dedicated resources. In 2021, we continued to build out a dedicated team to lead and support our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
•Adopting policies, processes and guidelines to promote an equitable and respectful organizational culture. This includes a rigorous and transparent process for investigating workplace complaints and concerns, as well as ongoing efforts to codify and promote behavioral expectations for employees working at The Times on how to approach their work, and engage with, manage and lead each other.
•Focusing on pay equity. Every two years, including in 2021, we conduct a pay-equity study, an in-depth review of our compensation practices conducted with an outside expert to identify, assess and rectify any inconsistencies in pay. We analyze average differences across race and gender of people performing similar work, taking into account factors that explain legitimate differences in pay, such as tenure and performance, and also perform a thorough analysis of individual pay. 
•Investing in diversifying the employee pipeline. We are creating and expanding programs like The New York Times Fellowship Program (a one-year work program for up-and-coming journalists), hosting an annual Student Journalism Institute for journalists of color, and supporting many outside organizations dedicated to increasing diversity in journalism, technology and media. 
•Evolving opportunities for identity-based connection. We currently have 13 active employee resource groups providing opportunities for employees with a shared identity to support each other and serving as a forum through which to develop leadership and management skills. 
Developing and promoting talent
We recognize the importance of creating opportunities for employees to evolve and succeed, at every level.
Identifying and putting in place effective executive leadership is critically important to our success. Our Board of Directors works with senior management to ensure that strategic plans are in place for both short- and long-term executive succession. The Board conducts an annual detailed review of the Company’s leadership pipeline and succession plans for key senior leadership roles. 
We also value ongoing development and continuous learning, and strive to support and provide enriching opportunities to our employees. We have made significant investments to bolster role-based and professional development learning and skill building to further meet the needs of our workforce. 
Providing equitable and competitive total rewards
Talent – including our employees and those we seek to hire – is in high demand, particularly journalists and people working in digital product development disciplines. 
We offer comprehensive total rewards, which are designed to meet the needs of our current and future employees; support the Company’s strategic goals, mission and values; drive a high-performance culture; and offer competitive and equitable pay. In line with our business goals, our total rewards philosophy links compensation to achieving sustained high performance. Along with the compensation and benefits we provide, our reputation, workplace culture, and focus on equity and inclusion are all factors that help us attract and retain highly skilled people of diverse backgrounds.

Supporting employees’ health, safety and well-being
Our employees’ well-being is vital to our success, and their physical and mental health, safety and work-life balance are a top priority. We have invested in programs that help support their day-to-day wellness needs and goals including, but not limited to: access to licensed professional counselors, health coaching and advocacy services, fitness resources, child and elder care help, and more. 
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely. During 2021, we continued and broadened some of the benefits we introduced in the early stages of the pandemic that were designed to support employees during an extended period of working from home, including dependent care relief, office-supply reimbursement, ergonomic resources, and mental health and wellness support. We also continue to evolve our remote and distributed work policies and practices. These include protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees, including those who do not work remotely, such as those who are working in our offices, our journalists in the field and employees working in our College Point, N.Y., printing and distribution facility. 
We also continue to adapt to ever-changing workplace and workforce dynamics, and plan to transition to a hybrid work model with employees working both from our offices and remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of work styles where individuals, teams, and our business can be successful. 
Workforce Demographics
We had approximately 5,000 full-time equivalent employees as of December 26, 2021, which includes more than 2,000 involved in our journalism operation.
Approximately 38% of our full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions as of December 26, 2021. In addition, some of our technology employees are seeking to form a union.
