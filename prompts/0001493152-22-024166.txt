Summary
 
Madison Technologies Inc. (“Madison” or the “Company” or “we” or “us” or “our”) is a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on June 15, 1998.
 
On February 16, 2021, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Sovryn Holdings, Inc. (“Sovryn”) and the holders (the “Sovryn Shareholders”) of Sovryn’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Sovryn Common Shares”), pursuant to which the Shareholders exchanged 100% of the outstanding Sovryn Common Shares, for (i) 100 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series B Preferred Stock”), which was transferred by Jeffrey Canouse, our controlling shareholder and Chief Executive Officer at the time (the “Controlling Shareholder”), to the designee of Sovryn and (ii) 1,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share of Sovryn (“Series E Preferred Stock,” and together with Series B Preferred Stock, the “Preferred Exchange Shares,” and the foregoing exchange of Sovryn Common Shares for Preferred Exchange Shares being the “Equity Exchange”).
 
Immediately prior to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, we entered into Exchange Agreements (the “Convertible Note Exchange Agreements”) with the holders of our outstanding of convertible promissory notes (the “Convertible Notes”). Pursuant to Convertible Note Exchange Agreements, the holders of the Convertible Notes were issued, in exchange for their Convertible Notes, a total of 230,000 shares of our newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock. Our new Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into common stock at a ratio of 1,000 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock held. Immediately prior to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, we entered into Exchange Agreements (the “Preferred Stock Exchange Agreements” and together with the Convertible Note Exchange Agreements, the “Exchange Agreements”) with the holders of our outstanding series A convertible preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). Pursuant to the Preferred Stock Exchange Agreements, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock were issued, in exchange for their Series A Preferred Stock, options to purchase a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of our newly to be formed wholly owned subsidiary to be called CZJ License, Inc. In addition, the agreements related to the Luxurie Legs line of products were transferred to CZJ License, Inc. in March 2021.
 
On February 17, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with funds affiliated with Arena Investors LP (the “Investors”) pursuant to which we issued convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.5 million for an aggregate purchase price of $15 million (collectively, the “Notes”). In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we issued to the Investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 192,073,017 shares of Common Stock (collectively, the “Warrants”) and 1,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock (the “Series F Preferred Stock”).
 
The Notes each have a term of thirty-six months and mature on February 17, 2024, unless earlier converted. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 11% per annum, subject to increase to 20% per annum upon and during the occurrence of an event of default. Interest is payable in cash on a quarterly basis beginning on March 31, 2021. Notwithstanding the above, at our election, any interest payable on an applicable payment date may be paid in our registered Common Stock (rather than cash) in an amount equal (A) the amount of the interest payment due on such date, divided by (B) an amount equal to 80% of the average volume weighted average price of our Common Stock for the five days immediately preceding the date of conversion.
 
The Notes are convertible at any time, at the holder’s option, into shares of our Common Stock at a price of $0.02, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”), subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations (with a maximum ownership limit of 9.99%). The conversion price is also subject to adjustment due to certain events, including stock dividends, stock splits and in connection with our issuance of Common Stock or common stock equivalents at an effective price per share lower than the conversion price then in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Conversion Price in effect shall be equal to 75% of the average volume weighted average price of our Common Stock for the five Trading Days on the Trading Market immediately preceding the date of conversion (the Alternative Conversion Price”); provided, however, that the Alternate Conversion Price may not exceed $0.015 per share, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Notes. The conversion price is also subject to adjustment due to certain events, including stock dividends, stock splits and in connection with our issuance of common Stock or common stock equivalents at an effective price per share lower than the conversion price then in effect. We may not redeem the Notes.

Our operations, prior to the acquisition of Sovryn Holdings, Inc. in February 2021, included (i) the distribution of Tuffy Pack’s product line of custom inserts that provided a level of personal protection from ballistic threats similar to what law enforcement officers wear daily as bullet proof vests and (ii) with its licensing agreement with the Casa Zeta-Jones Brand, development and distribution of a new luxury shaving regiment under the Luxurie Legs line of products exclusively designed and branded for women under the Casa Zeta-Jones Brand.
 
We abandoned the Tuffy Pack product line during the fourth quarter of 2020 and in connection with the Acquisition of Sovryn Holdings, as described below, we no longer intended to focus on the CZJ Brand and Luxurie Legs line of products and instead pursued the business of Sovryn Holdings.
 
Product and Services
 
We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sovryn embarked on an acquisition strategy, rolling-up un-affiliated Class A/LPTV TV stations in the top 100 DMA’s (Designated Market Areas) with a goal of building out a nationwide platform through one or more station acquisitions per DMA. Each licensed TV station can broadcast between 10 and 12 and potentially more revenue “streams” of content (“channels”) over-the-air, 24 hours per day/7 days per week. Management’s strategy is to stage the acquisitions focusing on DMA’s 1-30 and expanding thereafter on DMA’s 31-100, acquiring one station per DMA and building a portfolio of 100 stations within 18-24 months. Management has received FCC approval for seven acquisitions (i) KNLA/KNET, a Class A television station in Los Angeles, (ii) KVVV, a low power television station in Houston and (iii) KYMU-LD, a low power television station in Seattle, having closed, with four remaining, W27EB Chicago, KVSD San Diego, KPHE Phoenix, and KDTL St. Louis. Finally, we have also signed a purchase agreements to acquire the WXNY in New York and WANN in Atlanta, as well ownership of The Jay & Tony Show.
 
Madison’s initial objective was to create a broadcast Over-The-Air (“OTA”) content distribution platform to capitalize on the changing media and distribution landscape and on the growing OTA viewership in the U.S. The over-the-air programming carried on these stations is initially expected to include entertainment, shopping, weather, sports as well as religious networks and networks targeting select ethnic groups with content lease agreements as the prime source of revenue. Pricing of lease agreements is in part determined by market rank, the signal contour and the number of OTA TV households in a given market, as well as supply and demand.

Recent Developments 
 
We are exploring more capital efficient and technology centric alternatives to its planned station acquisition distribution platform. While there is no guarantee that we will be successful with this alternative approach, we have determined that we will postpone further capital expenditures on acquisitions and as a result, the planned acquisitions of W27EB-Chicago, KPHE-Phoenix, KVSD-San Diego, WANN-Atlanta and KDTL-St. Louis stations have been terminated and future acquisition plans have been put on hold while we evaluate this alternative approach.
 
As the cornerstone of our new strategy, we formed a new vertical and have embarked on a buildout of a news and entertainment network, Blockchain TV (“BCTV”) dedicated to cryptocurrency, NFT, Web3 and blockchain technology which we expect to launch in the coming months. On February 15, 2022, we entered into an agreement with TMG, Inc., a Canada-based television production firm to produce, manage and operate the television network and have since hired and engaged a number of blockchain news and entertainment personalities as anchors and hosts.
 
Through our relationship with TMG, Inc., we plan to produce, manage and operate proprietary content that will be broadcast and streamed 24/7 as “BCTV” on our OTA platform, APP and website and through third party broadcasters, cable television operators, alternative video distribution platforms such as YouTube, Roku, Pluto and xumo. The live content is designed and modeled after “Squawk Box” with anchors, Bobby Del Rio, Catherine Murray and Ruth O’Neill, bringing viewers live, hourly shows on what is happening in the crypto space, NFT, Web3 and the Metaverse marketplace. BCTV plans to go “live” with its network in the third quarter of 2022. Our primary revenue sources for BCTV will be advertising and sponsorship revenues.
 
We seek to complete our acquisition of Top Dog Productions, Inc., a Los Angeles based television production company founded and operated by Award-winning producers Jay Blumenfield and Tony Marsh. Their studio team will continue creating and developing shows for third party networks as well proprietary content for BCTV. One example is their creation of an unscripted series, “Woke up Rich”, that details rags to riches story of individuals who got involved in crypto.
 
We plan to derive additional programming content by aggregating the world’s top influencers in the space, bringing larger than life personalities to the screen and elevating their viral content into long and short-form programing that we push out on all platforms from social media to broadcast television. We envision airing gaming content with viewers enabled to play along interactively and be rewarded with real world and meta world prizes.
 
We registered the trademark “BLOCKCHAIN.TV Power 100” and we are compiling a list of the top 100 most influential people and companies in the blockchain space around the world that we plan to use as a source for interviews that we incorporate in a daily show. Our programming content plans include Blockchain Awards Shows for NFT, Crypto and Metaverse.
 
We plan to livestream our content globally with game center technology from studios in New York City, Miami and Niagara Fall, Canada. Blockchain Entertainment will create and develop special events and conferences including opportunities around education.
 
We see the opportunity to use BLOCKCHAIN.TV to generate another revenue stream through e-commerce opportunities in Community NFT, Metaverse and crypto services.
 
Station Operations
 
Each licensed TV station has the capability of delivering 10+ different TV channels of content Over-the-Air, 24 hours per day/7 days per week. If converted to the new FCC approved ATSC 3.0 technology, the streaming capacity will increase to 25+ channels or more, giving us the potential to stream content upon completion of the roll-up to over 2500 channels aggregated over expected 100 stations.
 
We operate the stations remotely and centrally, eliminating the need for in-market personnel or a studio facility. Remote operations of stations results in significant cost efficiencies. Recent FCC deregulation in TV broadcasting has eliminated the need for full time employees and studio facilities operating Class A and Low Power stations allowing for greater cost efficiency.

--------------------------+------------------+-------

New Broadcast TV Technology
 
In 2017, the FCC approved ATSC 3.0 technology, a next generation broadcast platform that will bring new revenue opportunities to broadcast television. ATSC 3.0 is an enhancement to the previous standard, providing new opportunities such as increased capacity, mobility and addressability allowing for customizable content, viewer measurability, target advertising and internet connectivity. All these features and more will be available on mobile devices allowing for broadcast operators to capitalize on audiences traditionally reserved for telecom operators.
Competitive Conditions
 
Our broadcast stations will face competition from other free over-the-air television and radio stations, telecommunication companies, cable and satellite providers, print media providers, internet and other emerging technologies. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources and access to capital. If we need to obtain additional funding, we may not be able to obtain such capital on favorable terms and be forced to delay its development as a result. Furthermore, technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives may increase competition for household audiences.
 
Our BCTV content will compete for viewership in a marketplace that is fragmented and niche. Major media organizations such as Bloomberg and Comcast, which operates CNBC and MSNBC, deliver content about crypto, NFT, Web3 and the metaverse, but none have a dedicated source for viewers to continuously consume that content.
 
Dependence on Customers
 
Currently, we are not and will not be dependent on one or a few major customers. Our business is designed to generate revenue from four primary categories of customers: (1) advertisers and sponsors of our BCTV content that airs on our OTA platform, APP and website and through third party broadcasters, cable television operators, alternative video distribution platforms such as YouTube, Roku, Pluto and xumo; (2) people who view our BCTV content, and form the audience that attracts advertisers and sponsors; (3) people who interact with our content either as viewers or as attendees as BLOCKCHAIN.TV branded events; and (4) third party networks that lease channels on our OTA platform.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Except for the trademark “BLOCKCHAIN.TV Power 100”, we do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
 
Governmental and Industry Regulations
 
Broadcast licenses are issued by and subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC regulates our broadcasting business and has the authority to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcast licenses and impose penalties for the violation of its regulations. We must often obtain the FCC’s approval to obtain, renew, assign or modify a license, purchase a new station or sell an existing station. Our FCC license for KVVV is due for renewal on August 1, 2022, our licenses for KNLA and KNET are due for renewal on December 1, 2022 and our license for KYMU is due for renewal on February 1, 2023. The FCC licenses are critical to the operations and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future if acquired or approve new acquisitions in a timely manner. If licenses are not renewed or acquisitions are not approved, we may lose revenue that we could otherwise have earned and this would have an adverse effect on the overall business and financial condition.
 
We will be subject to federal and state laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations including federal securities laws. Madison will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of its business.
