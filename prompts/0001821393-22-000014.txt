ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "our Company", "The Aaron's Company," "Aaron's," "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to The Aaron’s Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, which holds, directly or indirectly, the assets and liabilities historically associated with the historical Aaron’s Business segment (the "Aaron’s Business") prior to the 2020 separation of the Aaron's Business segment from the Progressive Leasing and Vive segments further described below. 
Our Company
The Aaron’s Company, Inc. is a leading, technology-enabled, omni-channel provider of lease-to-own (“LTO”) and purchase solutions of furniture, appliances, consumer electronics, and accessories. Since its founding in 1955, Aaron’s has been committed to serving the overlooked and underserved customer with a dedication to inclusion and improving the communities in which it operates. Through our portfolio of approximately 1,300 stores and our Aarons.com e-commerce platform, we provide consumers with LTO and purchase solutions for the products they need and want, with a focus on providing our customers with unparalleled customer service and an attractive value proposition, including competitive monthly payments and total cost of ownership as compared to other LTO providers, high approval rates, and lease plan flexibility. In addition, we offer a wide product selection, free prompt delivery, product setup, service and returns, and the ability to pause, cancel or resume lease contracts at any time with no penalty to the customer.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 1,074 Company-operated stores in 43 states and Canada, and 236 independently-owned franchised stores in 35 states and Canada.
BrandsMart Acquisition
On February 23, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 100% ownership of Interbond Corporation of America, doing business as BrandsMart U.S.A. ("BrandsMart"). Founded in 1977, BrandsMart is one of the leading appliance and consumer electronics retailers in the southeast United States and one of the largest appliance retailers in the country with ten stores in Florida and Georgia and a growing e-commerce presence on brandsmartusa.com. Under the terms of the agreement, total consideration is approximately $230 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments, and the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including obtaining applicable regulatory approvals.
Management believes that the acquisition will strengthen Aaron’s ability to deliver on its mission of enhancing people’s lives by providing easy access to high quality furniture, appliances, electronics, and other home goods through affordable lease to own and retail purchase options. Value-creation opportunities include leveraging Aaron’s lease-to-own expertise to provide BrandsMart's customers enhanced payment options and offering a wide selection of BrandsMart product assortment to millions of Aaron’s customers.
Description of 2020 Spin-off Transaction
On October 16, 2020, management of Aaron’s, Inc. finalized the formation of a new holding company structure in anticipation of the separation and distribution transaction described below. Under the holding company structure, Aaron’s, Inc. became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of a newly formed company, Aaron’s Holdings Company, Inc. Aaron's, Inc. was subsequently converted to a limited liability company ("Aaron’s, LLC") holding the assets and liabilities historically associated with the historical Aaron's Business segment (the "Aaron's Business"). Upon completion of the holding company formation, Aaron’s Holdings Company, Inc. became the publicly traded parent company of the Progressive Leasing segment ("Progressive Leasing"), Aaron’s Business, and Vive segment ("Vive").
On November 30, 2020 (the "separation and distribution date"), Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc. completed the previously announced separation of the Aaron's Business from Progressive Leasing and Vive and changed its name to PROG Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as "PROG Holdings" or "Former Parent"). The separation of the Aaron's Business was effected through a distribution (the "separation", the "separation and distribution", or the "spin-off transaction") of all outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed company called The Aaron's Company, Inc., a Georgia Corporation ("Aaron's", "The Aaron's Company" or "the Company"), to the PROG Holdings shareholders of record as of November 27, 2020. Upon the separation and distribution, Aaron's, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Aaron's Company. Shareholders of PROG Holdings received one share of The Aaron's Company common stock for every two shares of PROG Holdings' common stock. Upon completion of the separation and distribution transaction, The Aaron's Company, Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company under the ticker "AAN" on the New York Stock Exchange. References to PROG Holdings may refer to Aaron's, Inc. or Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc. for transactions, events, and obligations prior to the separation and distribution date or PROG Holdings, Inc. for transactions, events, and obligations of PROG Holdings at or subsequent to the separation and distribution date.
Strategic Plan
Our management team is committed to executing against the following core set of strategic priorities to further transform and grow the business:
•Align our Store Footprint to our Customer Opportunity – We continue to invest in our market strategy capabilities to make better-informed, evidence-driven decisions around store location. We are conducting a strategic review of our real estate portfolio, which we expect will increase profitability while successfully serving our markets through repositioning, remodeling, and consolidating our existing stores via our next-generation store concept ("GenNext"). The GenNext store concept features larger showrooms and/or re-engineered store layouts, increased product selection, technology-enabled shopping and checkout, and a refined operating model. We expect that this strategy, together with our Aarons.com e-commerce platform and increased use of technology to better serve our customers, will enable us to reduce store count while continuing to better serve our existing markets, as well as attracting new customers and expand into new markets in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we have 116 GenNext stores in our portfolio, with plans to add an additional 120 GenNext concept stores by December 31, 2022.
•Simplify and Digitize the Customer Experience – We continue to provide an enhanced customer experience by developing and maintaining technologies that give the customer more access to what they want and need, and more control over the lease transaction. These technologies include data-enabled lease decisioning, fully transactional, on-line shopping and payment platforms that increase flexibility and customization for the customer. Further, we have meaningfully expanded the product assortment on Aarons.com by enhancing our marketplace capabilities by providing access to a larger variety of products without increasing our inventory. These initiatives are designed to allow our customers to transact and manage the payment process through their digital devices. We expect these initiatives to increase repeat business, reduce our customer acquisition cost, improve the performance of our customer lease portfolio and enhance the customer experience.
•Promote our Value Proposition to Attract New Customers to our Brand – We continue to develop innovative marketing campaigns that better illustrate our value proposition to new, existing, and previous Aaron’s customers. To do this, we utilize a broad spectrum of traditional and digital marketing communications, from national broadcast campaigns to local market media to increasing digital investments, allowing us to customize messages. Our communications are all designed to educate our target customers about our key competitive advantages. These advantages include competitive monthly payments and total cost of ownership as compared to other LTO providers, high approval rates and industry-leading customer service. We offer a wide product selection, free prompt delivery, product setup, service and returns, and the ability to pause, cancel or resume lease contracts at any time with no penalty to the customer. Additionally, to further our omnichannel efforts to reach customers where they prefer to shop, we have invested in a technology-driven sales program ("Inside Sales Program") that employs remote full and part-time sales representatives to help potential customers find the products they are seeking and assist them through the lease process. We believe this value proposition, supported by our advanced omnichannel capabilities and existing store and supply chain infrastructure, differentiates us from competitors and will drive new customers to both our e-commerce and in-store channels. 
•Further environmental, social, and governance initiatives ("ESG") – We continue to invest in building a people-focused workplace culture and in opportunities to make a positive impact on the environment and the communities where our customers and team members live and work. To do this, in 2021, we completed maturity assessments for our compliance, enterprise risk management, and corporate governance programs and have developed roadmaps for enhancing these programs in 2022 and beyond. Also, in 2021, we conducted a strategic review of Aaron’s diversity and inclusion initiatives and then announced a new vision and strategy for the future of this program. In 2022, we plan to conduct maturity assessments for our safety and environmental management programs and to develop roadmaps for continued maturity of these program. Finally, we remain committed to contributing at least 1% of our annual, consolidated pre-tax profits to help build stronger communities. We expect these initiatives to continue improving the sustainability of Aaron’s. 
Competitive Assets
We have a unique set of physical and intangible assets developed over decades in the LTO business, which are difficult, expensive, and time consuming to replicate. We have developed a comprehensive strategy to leverage these assets including the following:
•Our brand and physical presence in approximately 700 markets – With over 65 years in business, the Company is recognized nationwide as a leader in the LTO marketplace. This brand recognition has led to an approximate 67% repeat customer rate for the new leases we enter into, and as of December 31, 2021, our Company-operated and franchised stores had approximately 1.1 million customers with active leases. We believe the versatility of our 
business model enables us to successfully serve diverse markets including rural, suburban and urban markets, helping mitigate the impact of local economic disruptions resulting from specific industry economic cycles, weather, and other disruptive events.
•Industry leading technology and analytics – The Company has invested in technology to improve the customer experience and its operational execution. These investments include platforms for enhanced data analytics, data-enabled lease decisioning, digital customer onboarding, centralized payment processing and an e-commerce website that allows the customer to review and select merchandise, complete the lease application and, if approved, complete the LTO agreement and make the first lease payment on-line. Our technology-enabled platforms simplify the transaction and provide customers with enhanced transparency and flexibility throughout their lease, and provide management with information needed to optimize the financial performance of the business.
•Management teams with deep industry experience and customer relationships – The Company's stores are managed by a group of tenured managers and multi-unit leaders who have deep knowledge of the LTO transaction and operations, as well as experience with our overlooked and underserved customer base. Our high levels of customer service are enhanced by years of relationship building and LTO industry experience that is hard to replicate. Our average management tenure is as follows: 8 years for store managers; 10 years for regional managers; 15 years for area directors, 16 years for divisional vice presidents; and 23 years for our Chief Store Operations Officer.
•Last-mile, reverse logistics and refurbishment capabilities – We have approximately 2,300 delivery trucks located throughout our network enabling us to provide last-mile and reverse logistics capabilities in our markets. All Aaron’s stores have a dedicated logistics team and infrastructure that enable us to offer our customers complimentary, prompt delivery, in-home set-up, product repair or replacement services, and reverse logistics for the products our customers obtain from us. Our stores also include refurbishment operations for returned merchandise, allowing us to provide pre-leased products for lease or sales in our stores and maximize inventory utilization.
•In-house upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturing – Under our Woodhaven Furniture Industries ("Woodhaven") manufacturing division, we have the capacity to manufacture approximately 1.5 million units per year of furniture and bedding, utilizing over 800,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in five primary furniture facilities and six mattress locations. In-house manufacturing provides control over quality and construction, fast response to changing customer tastes and market trends, reduced inventory fulfillment lead times, and mitigation of inventory supply disruptions.
Operating Segments
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has one operating and reportable segment ("Aaron's"), which is consistent with the current organizational structure and how the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews results to analyze performance and allocate resources. 
The operating results of our reportable segment may be found in (i) Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The Lease-to-Own Business Model
The LTO model offers customers an attractive alternative to traditional methods of purchasing furniture, appliances, electronics, computers and a variety of other products and accessories. In a standard LTO transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term renewable lease-to-own plan, usually 12 to 24 months, typically by making weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease renewal payments. The customer also has the option to cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to the lessor and only making payments required for the accrued lease period. If the customer renews the lease for each periodic renewal period through the completion of the lease ownership plan, they then obtain ownership of the item. In addition, LTO transactions typically include early ownership options, free delivery and in-home set-up of the merchandise, free repairs when needed, and other benefits.
An LTO agreement provides flexibility, affordable payments, and no long-term commitment, and is available to all customers who are approved, including those who are credit challenged. Other consumers who find the LTO model appealing are those who have a temporary need for merchandise, those who want to try a product at home before committing to the full cost of ownership, and those who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt. We believe the LTO value proposition results in high customer loyalty and repeat purchase behavior, which reduces customer acquisition costs and improves customer lifetime value.
LTO businesses benefit from relatively stable, renewable lease revenues and predictable cash flows provided by pools of lease agreements originated in prior periods. Our renewable lease revenue streams help insulate the business in times of macro-economic disruption and reduce reliance on current period sales and customer traffic for cash flows as compared to other retailing models. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 89% of the Company's total revenue was generated from recurring revenue streams related to our contracted lease payments.
Our Market Opportunity
Our core customer base is principally comprised of overlooked and underserved consumers in the United States and Canada with limited access to traditional credit sources. According to Fair Isaacs Corporation, more than 100 million people in the United States either have no credit score or have a score below 650. Historically, during economic downturns, our customer base expands due to tightened credit underwriting by banks and credit card issuers, as well as employment-related factors which may impact customers’ ability to otherwise purchase products from traditional retailers using cash or traditional financing sources. We have stores strategically located in over 700 markets across the United States and Canada and are within five miles of 43.8% of U.S. households. Our stores are designed and merchandised to appeal to customers across different types of markets, including urban, suburban and rural markets.
Operations
Aaron's Omni-channel Operations
We are committed to providing our customers with an exceptional omni-channel platform which includes an in-store and on-line shopping experience that allows Aaron’s to engage customers in ways that are convenient and preferable for them. This platform includes a digital guided experience of the customer's LTO transaction through data-enabled lease decisioning, digital servicing and payment options, as well as a digitally streamlined shopping experience on our e-commerce website, Aarons.com. Aarons.com allows customers to seamlessly browse for merchandise, obtain approval for a lease, complete the lease transaction, and access on-line self-service of lease payments and account management. Additionally, our technology-driven Inside Sales Program is designed to help potential customers find the products they are seeking and assist them through the lease process. As a result of our technology-enabled omni-channel strategy, we are attracting more new and younger customers to our brand, and many of the Aarons.com transactions come from individuals who previously had not shopped at Aaron's.
As of December 31, 2021, we have stores located in 43 states and Canada, and our portfolio is comprised of 1,074 company-operated locations and 236 franchised locations, which are owned and operated by independent franchisees on a licensed basis. We have developed a distinctive store concept including specific merchandising standards, store designs, and flexible payment options, all designed to appeal to our customer base. Our typical store layout is a combination of showroom, customer service and warehouse space, generally comprising 6,000 to 15,000 square feet. Most stores have at least two trucks for prompt last-mile delivery, service and return of product.
We have various levels of leadership that oversee our business operations, including divisional vice presidents, area directors and regional managers. At the individual store level, the general manager is primarily responsible for managing and supervising all aspects of store operations, including (a) customer relations and account management, (b) deliveries and pickups, (c) warehouse and inventory management, (d) merchandise selection, (e) employment decisions, including hiring, training and terminating store team members, and (f) certain marketing initiatives. General managers also administer the process of returning merchandise including making determinations with respect to inspection, product repair or replacement, sales, reconditioning and subsequent re-leasing.
We use management information systems to facilitate customer orders, lease renewal payments, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Substantially all of our stores are network-linked directly to corporate headquarters enabling us to monitor single store performance on a daily basis. This network system assists the general manager in (a) tracking merchandise on the showroom floor and warehouse, (b) minimizing delivery times, (c) assisting with product purchasing, and (d) matching customer needs with available inventory.
By leveraging our investments in technology, including Aarons.com, data-enabled lease decisioning, and our omni-channel customer service and payment platforms, we believe that we can serve our existing markets through a more efficient store portfolio while continuing to provide the high level of service our customers expect. 
Lease Agreement Approval and Decisioning
The Aaron's lease decisioning solutions are core to managing the risk of our lease agreement portfolio. We have developed proprietary lease approval processes with respect to our U.S. Company-operated stores through a fully automated technology-driven algorithm-enabled centralized digital decisioning platform, which is designed to improve our customer experience by streamlining and standardizing the lease decisioning process and shortening transaction times. Customers receive lease approval decisions either on-line at Aarons.com enabling them to shop on Aarons.com, or at apply.aarons.com, a quick, convenient digital approval process that allows consumers to shop with approval in hand at an Aaron's retail location. Our lease decisioning solutions have allowed us to optimize approval rates, lease amounts, full ownership conversions, write-offs, and revenue outcomes. We believe continuous innovation and frequent enhancements to the Aaron's lease decisioning solutions gives us an edge over our competition.
At the core of the lease decisioning solutions are the Aaron's lease decisioning models. Our model development efforts utilize modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. We utilize a multitude of traditional and alternative data sources in the model training process in an effort to maximize the predictive power of the decisioning models, while working with appropriate internal and external resources to assure compliant and consistent results. The combination of modern data science techniques and a wide breadth of data produces models that are highly capable of discerning lease applications that are likely to be profitable from lease applications that are not. Our technology platforms enable these models to produce decisions in real time for each lease application.
The second pillar of the Aaron's decisioning solution is a robust set of post-model processes that determine the appropriate lease amounts or product approvals depending on the risk associated with the application. Higher scored applications are eligible for larger lease amounts or product approvals. 
Lastly, the Aaron's decisioning solution includes fraud prevention processes. Our fraud prevention processes focus on identity and the digital fingerprint associated with lease applications. To reduce our synthetic fraud risk exposure, we evaluate risks associated with emails, phones, and devices used in an application. We employ automated knowledge-based authentication depending on the fraud risk level of each lease application. We believe this authentication reduces our fraud risk while still offering a streamlined lease application experience for the consumer.
We continue to enhance our decisioning capabilities by adopting an iterative “test and learn” approach and expect that we will continue to drive positive outcomes through incremental enhancements. Franchised stores have also implemented this data-enabled decisioning platform in their stores as well. In addition to utilizing this decisioning platform, stores may occasionally complete the lease approval process by verifying the applicant’s employment, or other reliable sources of income, and using personal references, which was the approval method used by our stores prior to the implementation of our data-enabled digital decisioning platform. 
Merchandising
We employ a merchandising strategy that spans three primary key product categories: furniture, home appliances and electronics. We have long-term relationships with many well-known and aspirational brands, including Samsung®, GE®, HP®, JBL®, Simmons®, Lane® and Ashley®. We purchase merchandise directly from manufacturers and local distributors at competitive prices. One of our largest suppliers is our own Woodhaven Furniture Industries manufacturing division, which supplies the majority of the bedding and a significant portion of the upholstered furniture we lease and sell. In recent years, we have strategically focused on growing the revenue contribution of furniture and appliances to align with macro-economic expansion in these categories and attract new customers. In addition, we have increased our product offerings through expanded assortment on Aarons.com and our in-store digital shopping platform. 
The following table shows the percentage of our revenues attributable to different merchandise categories:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Aaron's Merchandise Category | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Furniture | 43 | % | | 44 | % | 44 | %
Home appliances | 31 | % | | 29 | % | 27 | %
Electronics | 23 | % | | 24 | % | 26 | %
Other | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %

Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing efforts target potential new customers, as well as current and previous customers, through a variety of traditional and digital media channels including on-line search, TV, radio, digital video, and direct mail, with a combination of brand and 
promotional messaging. We continue to test new ways to engage potential customers and identify audience segments that find the LTO solution appealing.
With our fast-growing e-commerce business, we focus heavily on digital marketing including search, display, and social media to help drive traffic to both stores and our e-commerce website. Our e-commerce marketing is dynamically managed on a daily basis and is growing as a share of spend relative to traditional marketing channels.
We continue to refine and expand our overall contact strategy to grow our customer base. We test various types of advertising and marketing campaigns and strategies, analyze the results of those tests and, based on our learnings, refine those campaigns and strategies to attempt to maximize their effectiveness with current and potential customers. By understanding optimal offers and products to promote to current and former customers, along with potential prospects, we look to continue improvements in marketing return on investment. With respect to existing customers, direct mail and email serve as the primary tools we utilize in our marketing strategies. With respect to marketing to potential customers, our primary tools currently include digital, direct mail, and traditional broadcasting and search advertising.
Franchising
As of December 31, 2021, we had 67 franchisees, who operate a total of 236 franchised store locations. We have existing agreements with our current franchisees to govern the operations of franchised stores. Our standard agreement is for a term of 10 years, with one ten-year renewal option, and requires our franchisees to operate in compliance with our policies and procedures. In collaboration with our franchisees, we are able to refine, further develop and test operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that we believe will ultimately benefit our company-operated stores. Franchisees are obligated to remit to us royalty payments of 6% of the weekly cash revenue collections from their stores.
From time to time, we may enter into franchise agreements with new franchisees or purchase store locations from our franchisees. We have purchased 306 store locations from our franchisees since January 1, 2017. We have not entered into a franchise agreement with a new franchisee in more than five years. We will continue to assess opportunities to both acquire existing franchise locations and franchise new markets that we wish to develop.
Some qualifying franchisees took part in a financing arrangement we established with several financial institutions to assist our existing franchisees in establishing and operating their store(s). Under that arrangement, which was originally established in 1994, we provide guarantees to the financial institutions that provide the loan facilities for amounts outstanding under this franchise financing program. At December 31, 2021, the maximum amount that the Company would be obligated to repay in the event franchisees defaulted was $8.3 million, all of which would be due within the next two years. However, due to franchisee borrowing limits, we believe any losses associated with defaults would be substantially mitigated through recovery of lease merchandise and other assets. Since the inception of the franchise loan program in 1994, the Company's losses associated with the program have been immaterial. The Company believes that any future amounts to be funded by the Company in connection with these guarantees will be immaterial.
Manufacturing
Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our domestic manufacturing division, was established in 1982. Woodhaven consists of five furniture and six bedding manufacturing facilities totaling approximately 800,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities help to ensure that during periods of supply chain volatility, we are better positioned to provide our stores with suitable inventory to meet customer demand. Substantially all the items Woodhaven produces continue to be leased or sold through our stores, including franchised stores. However, we also manufacture and sell furniture products to other retailers and directly to consumers on the Woodhaven direct-to-consumer site, woodhavenfurniture.com.
Woodhaven is a vertically integrated operation. Vertical integration enables us to better manage product availability, quality and cost with processes that include (a) digital design, construction and rendering, as well as physical prototyping, (b) cut and sew operation to process fabric and rolled goods into covers, (c) frame mill to process 100% of our frame components with hardwood and engineered panels, (d) foam fabrication operation to control foam and fiber quality, (e) product testing to assure product standards are met, and (f) multiple locations and material sources supports our business continuity planning.
Woodhaven produces upholstered living-room furniture (including contemporary sofas, chairs and modular sofa and ottoman collections in a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics) and bedding (including standard sizes of mattresses and box springs). The furniture produced by our integrated manufacturing operations incorporates features that we believe result in enhanced durability and improved shipping processes, as compared to furniture we would otherwise purchase from third parties. These features include (a) standardized components, (b) reduced number of parts and features susceptible to wear or damage, (c) more resilient foam, (d) durable fabrics and sturdy frames that translate to longer life and higher residual value, and (e) devices that allow sofas to stand on end for easier and more efficient transport. The division also provides replacement covers for all styles and fabrics of its upholstered furniture, as well as other parts, for use in reconditioning leased furniture that has been returned, so that our stores can continue to offer that furniture to our customers at a relatively low price point. 
Woodhaven is also able to generate ancillary income and right-size production by selling furniture to third parties, including large, national retailers. During each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 18%, 16%, and 8%, respectively, of total non-retail sales, which we define as sales of new merchandise to our franchisees and to third-party retailers, were generated by Woodhaven from sales to third-party retailers.
Lease Renewal
We continue to emphasize renewals-related compliance training, monitoring, and improvement initiatives, to ensure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations and our internal policies. One of the factors in the success of our operations is timely management of lease renewal payments, which are monitored by general managers and team members and our centralized Customer Retention team members. Customers who fail to make lease renewal payments are contacted within a few days after their renewal date to discuss working with them to find a way to keep their agreement active. When we have been unable to reach the customer by telephone, we may visit those customers at their residences to encourage them to keep their agreement active or potentially return the lease merchandise. Careful attention to managing lease renewal payments is particularly important in LTO operations, where the customer has the option to cancel the agreement at the conclusion of each periodic payment term by returning the product covered by the agreement, and each contractually due payment is considered a renewal of the agreement. Approximately 86% of the payments that we collect are via a payment card, which reduces our transaction costs and increases our efficiency. We continue to encourage customers to take advantage of the convenience of enrolling in our automatic payment program, and approximately 51% of our customer lease agreements are enrolled for automatic payments as of December 31, 2021. 
The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of consolidated lease revenues was 4.2%, 4.2% and 6.2% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that our renewals and recovery policies comply with applicable laws, and we discipline any employee we determine to have deviated from such policies.
Customer Success
Helping our customers achieve success throughout their lease-to-own journey is at the center of The Aaron's Mission: "To enhance people's lives by providing easy access to high quality products through affordable lease and purchase options".
We believe our strong focus on customer satisfaction generates repeat business and long-lasting relationships with our customers. Our customers receive multiple complimentary service benefits. These benefits vary according to applicable state law but generally include early purchase options, free delivery and set-up, free relocation of product to a new address within a specified geographic area, reinstatement options, product repair or replacement, access to digital tools to manage their account, and other discounts and benefits. Aaron's uncompromising focus on customers helps our customers to realize successful outcomes and yields a level of customer satisfaction that generates repeat business and a likelihood to recommend Aaron's to friends and family. Unlike traditional transactional retail sales, we have unique opportunity over the span of the LTO agreement to build a closer relationship with our customers, often celebrating, assisting, and supporting them through significant moments in their lives. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 67% of the new lease agreements we entered into were with repeat customers. 
We consider our store-based operations to be an important part of the communities we serve and treat all customers with respect. Customers who begin agreements on-line also have the support and service of a local store throughout the duration of the agreement. Our strong culture of customer service begins with our team members, both in our store-based operations and in our customer-facing contact centers, and requires that we develop skilled, empathetic team members who value our customers and who possess and project a genuine desire to understand and serve our customers’ needs. To meet this requirement, we maintain and continuously enhance a comprehensive team member development program for both new and tenured team members. This development program and our commitment to diversity and inclusion is designed to enable our team members to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for our customers as well as a compliant, consistent, and helpful customer service experience. Further details can be found within the "Human Capital Management" section below. 
Our store-based operations also offer customers the option to obtain a membership in the Aaron’s Club Program (the "Club Program"). The benefits to customers of the Club Program are separated into three general categories: (a) lease protection benefits; (b) health & wellness discounts; and (c) dining, shopping and consumer savings. Club Program enrollment is optional and may be canceled by the member at any time. 
The lease protection benefits may provide Club Program members with lease payment waivers for up to four months or a maximum of $1,000 on active customer lease agreements if the customer becomes unemployed or ill; replacement of the product if the product is stolen or damaged by an act of God; waiver of remaining lease payments on lease agreements where any member named on the lease agreement dies; and/or product repair or replacement for an extended period after the customer takes ownership. Club Program benefits vary by state. 
Distribution for our Multi-Channel E-commerce and Store-based Operations
Our multi-channel e-commerce and store businesses utilize our 15 fulfillment centers to control merchandise and offer our customers a wide product assortment. These centers average approximately 124,000 square feet, giving us approximately 1,860,000 square feet of logistics capacity outside of our network of stores.
We believe that our network of fulfillment centers provides a strategic advantage over our competitors. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores to quickly meet customer demand and effectively manage inventory levels. Most of our contiguous U.S. stores are within a 250-mile radius of a fulfillment center, facilitating timely shipment of products to the stores and fast delivery of orders to customers.
We realize freight savings and inventory productivity through centralized distribution of merchandise by using fulfillment centers. We use various contract carriers to make deliveries weekly to our stores nationwide. A fleet of over 2,300 store-based delivery trucks provide industry leading heavy goods last mile delivery and reverse logistics for returned products and the servicing of products.
Human Capital Management
On December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,170 full-time and part time team members, the majority of which were full-time team members. Approximately 7,570 of our team members were store or divisional/regional staff, with the remainder being part of the store support, fulfillment center, service center, and Woodhaven employee bases. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with team members are good, driven by our commitment to listen, learn, and continually improve.
Diversity and Inclusivity
We believe in being an inclusive workplace for all of our team members and are committed to having a diverse workforce that is representative of the customers that choose to shop with us in-store or online and the communities in which we operate our businesses. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business, enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base, and reflects the communities we serve. Our aim is to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also recruiting, developing, mentoring, training, and retaining a diverse workforce, including a diverse group of management-level team members.

Development and Career Opportunities
We believe in attracting top talent with a competitive wage and benefits offering and retaining them by providing an environment where team members can see that their career has a clear path of growth. To help facilitate that growth, we provide tools, resources and programs that adapt and grow with our team members. Our efforts include:

In addition, this learning content is scanned and reviewed internally, leading to targeted library content that focuses on topics and content areas determined to be of greatest relevance and importance to the organization;
•Delivering an in-house designed continuous learning program to avail store team members a career path with the destination of their choosing while using custom learning solutions designed to add and confirm both competencies and proficiencies throughout all levels of their career.

The 2021 annualized voluntary turnover rate in our stores and fulfillment centers was 72%, and the 2021 annualized involuntary turnover rate in the stores and fulfillment centers was 29%.
Health and Safety of Team Members and Customers
Aaron's takes the safety of our team members and our customers seriously. Aaron's policies and training programs support our health and safety practices. Throughout the year, team members complete compliance training relevant to their role. Completion of required compliance training is closely managed to ensure that team members have the required skills and knowledge to perform ethically and safely. Additional protocols were implemented in 2020 and remained in place throughout 2021 designed to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic related to the novel coronavirus disease. 
In our Company-operated stores, we are monitoring and limiting, where possible, team members' potential exposure to persons at or who may enter our stores, reviewing orders and industry-specific guidance from applicable federal and state laws, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations and Centers for Disease Control ("CDC") and state/local health authorities. Additionally, we continually evaluate our existing COVID-19 prevention controls and the need for different or additional controls, and conduct periodic inspections at our stores to identify unhealthy conditions, work practices, and work procedures related to COVID-19 to help ensure compliance with our COVID-19 policies and procedures.
Labor Practices and Human Rights
All of our team members earn more than the federal minimum wage. The average hourly wage of a full-time hourly operations employee in our Company-operated, stores and fulfillment centers, as of December 31, 2021, is $14.79, with a meaningful portion of those team members earning an average hourly wage of $15.50 or more. The average total compensation and benefits for a full-time hourly operations employee in our Company-operated stores and fulfillment centers is approximately $35,000 including wages, bonuses and benefits, such as paid time off.
Aaron’s respects the rights of workers who offer services and create the products that we purchase from our suppliers. We communicate our expectations to provide us with safe, energy-efficient, high-quality products, and we hold our suppliers to a high standard because we strive to be an example of good human rights and labor practices throughout our business activities. We take care in the selection of our suppliers, and we also communicate our expectations on social conditions, worker safety and integrity in the workplace, and compliance with applicable laws through our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our expectations with respect to hiring practices, forced labor, child labor, discrimination, and other labor rights. Suppliers must comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, conduct their business with a high level of integrity, and maintain accurate records to demonstrate that compliance. Specifically, we require our suppliers, in accordance with applicable laws, to meet the following standards per our Supplier Code of Conduct and standard terms and conditions:
•Treat all workers with dignity and respect; 
•Provide a safe, healthy, and clean work environment; 
•Provide safe and healthy housing if supplier provides residential housing for its team members; 
•Provide a discrimination, harassment, and punishment free environment; 
•Pay workers at least the minimum wage and benefits required; 
•Follow minimum working hour restrictions; 
•Prohibit child labor, forced labor and human trafficking; and 
•Comply any with law (including any changes from time to time) 
Our suppliers enter into a Master Supply Agreement with us in which they represent and warrant that all products are manufactured, packaged, tagged, and sold in compliance with all applicable laws and are legal for retail re-sale in each store that we operate without violation of any law. Specifically, all products must be packaged, labeled, and tested in compliance with all applicable laws, and the supplier must obtain and maintain all permits, licenses, certifications and registrations required by all applicable laws to provide their products.
From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those alleging employment discrimination or violations of wage-and-hour laws. During 2021, the total amount we paid to resolve proceedings alleging employment claims was immaterial to our earnings. In our efforts to have all team members comply with applicable employment-related laws, to drive positive workplace conduct, to strive to foster a fair and equitable workplace, and to reduce the number of employment discrimination claims brought against us, we provide a variety of resources, including non-discrimination and anti-harassment training as part of the Company’s mandatory compliance training, for all team members including team members in our call centers, fulfillment and service centers, store support center, and stores.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market with competition from national, regional and local operators of direct-to-consumer LTO stores and websites, virtual LTO companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs, point of sale financing, and title or installment lending), traditional and on-line sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. We also compete with retail stores for customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service, payment amounts, store location and terms, as well as total cost of merchandise ownership, the number and frequency of payments in lease ownership plans, and other factors.
Working Capital
Our LTO model results in us remaining the owner of merchandise on lease until the customer obtains ownership of the item; therefore, our most significant working capital asset is merchandise inventory on lease. Our store-based and e-commerce operations also require us to maintain significant levels of merchandise inventory available for lease to provide the service levels demanded by our customers and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such merchandise levels. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, and availability under our credit agreement is adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing at Woodhaven are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywood, oriented strand board and hardwood. All of these materials are purchased in the open market from unaffiliated sources. We have a diverse base of suppliers; therefore, we are not dependent on any single supplier. The sourcing 
of raw materials from our suppliers is not overly dependent on any particular country. While we have not had any material interruptions in our manufacturing operations due to COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages of raw materials, there can be no assurances that disruptions to our supply of raw materials will not become more significant, or that the costs of those raw materials will not increase significantly, going forward due to inflation and the adverse impacts of the pandemic.
Seasonality
Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal. Adjusting for growth, the first quarter of each year generally has higher revenues than any other quarter. This is primarily due to realizing the full benefit of business that historically gradually increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise during the first quarter of the year. We expect these trends to continue in future periods.
Due to the seasonality of our business and the extent of the impact of additional government stimulus, and/or enhanced unemployment benefits to our customers in response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, results for any quarter or period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
Government Regulation
Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, lease disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain lease renewal and collection procedures.
Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the LTO transaction. Federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of the business including matters such as renewal activity, marketing disclosures to customers and customer contact may be subject to federal laws and regulation.
There has been increased legislative and regulatory attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on financial services products offered to near-prime and subprime consumers in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the LTO industry. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be enacted and what the impact would be on us.
Additional regulations at both the state and federal level are under consideration, as the attention placed on financial services products and consumer debt transactions, including consumer debt collection practices, has grown significantly. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Federal regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on the subprime financial and credit-restricted marketplace within which much of our LTO customer base obtains products and services. Any of these agencies may propose and adopt new regulations, or interpret existing regulations, in a manner that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. In addition, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance.
From time to time, federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general have directed investigations or regulatory initiatives toward our industry, or toward certain companies within the industry.
In addition to federal regulatory oversight, currently, nearly every state and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate LTO transactions via state or provincial statutes, including states in which we currently operate our stores. Most state LTO laws require LTO companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state LTO laws limit the retail price for an item, the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that LTO companies may charge on LTO transactions, generally defining "cost-of-rental" as lease fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our LTO transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the various state LTO laws.
