OUR BUSINESS
 
We are a leading solutions provider that delivers actionable outcomes for organizations by using IT and consulting solutions to drive business agility and innovation. Leveraging our engineering talent, we assess, plan, deliver, and secure solutions comprised of leading technologies and consumption models aligned with our customers’ needs. Our expertise and experience enables ePlus to craft optimized solutions that take advantage of the cost, scale and efficiency of private, public and hybrid cloud in an evolving market. We also provide consulting, professional, managed and complete lifecycle management services including flexible financing solutions. We have been in the business of selling, leasing, financing, and managing IT and other assets for more than 28 years.
 
Our primary focus is to deliver integrated solutions that address our customers' business needs, leveraging the appropriate Cloud, Security and Digital Infrastructure technologies, both on-premise and in the cloud. Our approach is to lead with advisory consulting to understand our customers' needs, design, deploy and manage solutions aligned to their objectives. Underpinning the broader areas of Cloud, Security and Digital Infrastructure are specific skills in orchestration and automation, application modernization, DevOps, data management, data visualization, analytics, network modernization, edge compute and other advanced and emerging technologies. These solutions are comprised of class leading technologies from partners such as Arista Networks, Check Point, Cisco Systems, Citrix, Commvault, Dell EMC, F5 Networks, Gigamon, HP Inc., HPE, Juniper Networks, Lenovo, Microsoft, NetApp, NVIDIA, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Pure Storage, Quantum, Splunk, and VMware, among many others. We possess top-level engineering certifications with a broad range of leading IT vendors that enable us to offer multi-vendor IT solutions that are optimized for each of our customers’ specific requirements. Our hosted, proprietary software solutions are focused on giving our customers more control over their IT supply chain, by automating and optimizing the procurement and management of their owned, leased, and consumption-based assets.
 
Our scale and financial resources have enabled us to continue investing in engineering and technology resources to stay current with emerging technology trends. Our expertise in core and emerging technologies, buttressed by our robust portfolio of consulting, professional, and managed services has enabled ePlus to remain a trusted advisor for our customers. In addition, we offer a wide range of consumption options including leasing and financing for technology and other capital assets. We believe our lifecycle approach offering of integrated solutions, services, financing, and our proprietary supply chain software, is unique in the industry. This broad portfolio enables us to deliver a unique customer experience that spans the continuum from fast delivery of competitively priced products, services, subsequent management and upkeep, through to end-of-life disposal services. This approach permits ePlus to deploy ever-more-sophisticated solutions enabling our customers’ business outcomes.
 
Our go-to-market strategy focuses primarily on diverse end-markets for middle market to large enterprises. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the percentage of revenue by customer end market within our technology segment includes technology industry 24%, state and local government, and educational institutions 17%, financial services 15%, telecommunications, media and entertainment 14%, and healthcare 14%. Sales to Apple Inc. represented approximately 12% and 13% of our net sales for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales for the year ended March 31, 2016. The majority of our sales were generated within the United States (“U.S.”); however, we have the ability to support our customers nationally and internationally including physical locations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and India, which was established by acquisition in December 2015 and May 2017, respectively. Our technology segment accounts for 97% of our net sales, and 74% of our operating income, while our financing segment accounts for 3% of our net sales, and 26% of our operating income for the year ended March 31, 2018.

OUR INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND MARKET OPPORTUNITY
 
We participate in the large and growing United States IT market, which, according to Gartner, Inc. is estimated to generate sales of over $1.17 trillion in 2018, and is expected to grow by 3.6% in calendar year 2018 and at an annual rate of approximately 3.3% for 2017 through 20221.
 
We have focused on and identified several specific trends that we believe will create higher growth in the broader U.S. IT market:
 
 
· | Multi-Cloud Strategy. Over the past several years, cloud architectures and cloud-enabled frameworks, whether public, private, or hybrid, have become the core foundation of modern IT. Our strategy is to assist our customers in assessing, defining and deploying private and hybrid clouds that align with their business needs. This strategy leverages our strength in deploying private clouds, while also incorporating elements of the public cloud. By assessing their applications, workloads, business requirements, etc., we deploy solutions that leverage the best of all technology platforms and consumption models. For example, we may build a private cloud solution to host mission critical applications, while utilizing a public cloud solution for development, collaboration, or disaster recovery. As the market continues to mature, we will continue to build and acquire skills that align with agile development (DevOps), application refactoring, and analytics. Our cloud strategy is tightly aligned with all of our key strategic initiatives, including security, and digital infrastructure.

· | Increasing sophistication and incidences of IT security breaches and cyber-attacks. Over the last decade, cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated, more numerous and pervasive, and increasingly difficult to safeguard against. Most experts believe that it isn’t a matter of if a cyber-attack will affect an organization; it’s a matter of when and how often. We believe our customers are focused on all aspects of cyber security, including intellectual property and data and business processes, as well as compliance with an increasing number of general and industry-specific government regulations. To meet current and future security threats, enterprises must implement solutions that are fully-integrated and capable of monitoring, detecting, containing and remediating security threats and attacks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Disruptive technologies are creating complexity and challenges for customers and vendors. The rapid evolution of disruptive technologies, and the speed by which they impact organizations’ IT platforms, has made it difficult for customers to effectively design, procure, implement and manage their own IT systems. Moreover, increased budget pressures, fewer internal resources, a fragmented vendor landscape and fast time-to-value expectations make it challenging for customers to design, implement and manage secure, efficient and cost-effective IT environments. Customers are increasingly turning to IT solutions providers such as ePlus to implement complex IT offerings, including software defined infrastructure, cloud computing, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, big data analytics, and flash storage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customer IT decision-making is shifting from IT departments to line-of- business personnel. As IT consumption shifts from legacy, on-premise infrastructure to agile “on-demand” and “as-a-service” solutions, customer procurement decisions are shifting from traditional IT personnel to lines-of-business personnel, which is changing the customer engagement model and types of consultative services required to fulfill customer needs. In addition, many of the services create recurring revenue streams paid over time, rather than upfront revenue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lack of sufficient internal IT resources at mid-sized and large enterprises, and scarcity of IT personnel in certain high-demand disciplines. We believe that IT departments at mid-sized and large enterprises are facing pressure to deliver emerging technologies and business outcomes, but lack the properly trained staff and the ability to hire personnel with high in-demand disciplines such as security and data analytics. At the same time the prevalence of security threats; increased use of cloud computing, software-defined networking, new architectures, and rapid software development frameworks; the proliferation of mobile devices and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies; and complexity of multi-vendor solutions, have made it difficult for IT departments to implement high-quality IT solutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduction in the number of IT solutions providers. We believe that customers are seeking to reduce the number of solutions providers they do business with to improve supply chain and internal efficiencies, enhance accountability, improve supplier management practices, and reduce costs. As a result, customers are required to select IT solutions providers that are capable of delivering complex multi-vendor IT solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Increasing need for third-party services. We believe that customers are relying on third-party service providers, such as ePlus, to manage significant aspects of their IT environment, from design, implementation, pre- and post-sales support, to maintenance, engineering, cloud management, security operations, and other services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPETITION
 
The market for IT solutions is highly competitive, subject to macro-economic cycles and the entry of new competitors, consolidation of existing market participants which can create significantly larger competitors, and is significantly affected by disruptive technologies and other market activities of industry participants. We expect to continue to compete in all areas of our business against local, regional, national, and international firms, including: vendors, international, national, and regional resellers and service providers. Some of our competitors are direct marketers with little value add, and sell products as commodities which can place downward pressure on product pricing. In addition, many IT vendors may sell or lease directly to our customers, and our continued ability to compete effectively may be affected by the policies of such vendors. We face indirect competition from potential customers’ internal development efforts and have to overcome potential customers’ reluctance to move away from legacy systems, processes, and solution providers. As IT consumption shifts from IT personnel and legacy infrastructure to line-of-business based outcomes using off-premise, on-demand, and cloud solutions, the legacy resale model is shifting from an upfront sale to a recurring revenue model.
 
The leasing market is also competitive and subject to changing economic conditions and market activities of leading industry participants. We expect to continue to compete against local, regional, national, and international firms, including banks, specialty finance companies, private-equity asset managers, vendors' captive finance companies, and third-party leasing companies. Banks and other large financial services companies sell directly to business customers, particularly larger enterprise customers, and may provide other financial or ancillary services that we do not provide. Vendor captive leasing companies may use internal transfer pricing to effectively lower lease rates and/or bundle equipment sales and leasing to provide highly competitive packages to customers. Third-party leasing companies may have deep customer relationships with contracts in place that are difficult to displace; however, these competitors typically do not provide the breadth of product, service, and software offerings that we provide to our customers.
 
In all of our markets, some of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and customer requirements. Many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do.
 
OUR SOLUTIONS
 
Technology Segment
 
 
· | IT Sales: Our offerings consist of hardware, software, maintenance, software assurance, and internally-provided and outsourced services.

 7
 

Our products and services are targeted at large and the approximately 50,000 middle market companies, state and local governmental organizations and educational institutions in the United States and at international companies through our operations in the U.K. We believe IT organizations within these companies are facing pressure to deliver higher service levels with fewer resources, increasing their reliance on third-parties who can provide complex, multi-vendor technology solutions, such as our company.
 
Broad and Diverse Customer Base across a Wide Range of End Markets
 
We have a broad and diverse customer base of over 3,200 customers across a wide range of end-markets, including education, financial services, healthcare, media and entertainment, state and local government, technology, and telecommunications.
Differentiated Business Model Serving Entire IT Lifecycle – Procurement, Solutions, Services, Software, Financing
 
We believe we are a trusted IT advisor, delivering differentiated products and services to enable our customers to meet increasingly complex IT requirements. We are able to provide complete, turn-key solutions serving the entire IT lifecycle – procurement, products, services, software, and financing. We provide upfront assessments, configuration capabilities, installation and implementation, and ongoing services to support our customers’ solutions.
Deep Expertise in Advanced Technology to Address Cloud, Security, Digital Infrastructure and other Emerging IT Trends
 
We believe our customers choose us for their complex IT infrastructure needs based on our track record of delivering best-of-breed solutions, value-added services, and close relationships with both established and emerging vendors.
Strategic Ability to Design and Integrate Cloud Solutions Across Multiple Vendors
 
We believe our relationships with vendors focused on the design and integration of cloud systems allow us to provide differentiated cloud offerings. We have developed long standing, strategic partnerships with leading cloud systems vendors, including Cisco Systems, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, NetApp, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and VMware.
 
Our vendor agnostic approach allows us to provide the best customer-specific solutions. Our experienced professionals are trained in various product lines across vendors and have achieved top-level certifications with multiple strategic partners. In addition to providing initial products, our vendor certifications allow us to contract the assumption of many of the day-to-day maintenance and servicing functions for these products.
 
Proven Track Record of Successfully Integrating Acquisitions and Accelerating Growth
 
We view acquisitions as an important factor in our strategic growth plan. Since 1997, we have successfully integrated 20 acquisitions. Most recently, we have been active in tuck-in acquisitions to broaden our product offerings, sector reach, and geographic footprint, with recent acquisitions including:

· | Integrated Data Storage, LLC (“IDS”) an advanced data center solutions provider focused on cloud enablement and managed services, including its proprietary IDS Cloud. The acquisition expands ePlus’ footprint in the Midwest and enhances its sales and engineering capabilities in cloud services, disaster recovery and backup as a service, storage, data center, and professional services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | OneCloud Consulting, Inc. (“OneCloud”). The acquisition, based in Milpitas, California, provides us with additional ability to address customers’ needs in cloud-based solutions and infrastructure, including DevOps, OpenStack, and other emerging technologies, to our broad customer base.

We generally integrate acquired firms into the ePlus platform immediately, which allows us to maintain customers and vendor relationships, retain key employees from acquired firms, and accelerate growth.
 
We continue to review new acquisition opportunities to expand our global footprint and expand our offerings.
 
Financial Performance Characterized by Growth and Profitability
 
We have focused on achieving top-line revenue growth while maintaining industry-leading gross margins – with a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% on net sales and 9.6% for consolidated gross profit, respectively, from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2018.
 
Through our organic expansion and acquisitions, we have increased our employee base by 41.6% from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2018 while increasing adjusted gross billing per employee by approximately 14.8%. The increase in our employee base has largely been in customer facing roles.
 
GROWTH STRATEGY
 
Our goal is to continue to grow as a leading provider of technology solutions. The key elements of our strategy include the following:
 
Be Our Customers’ Partner of Choice for Comprehensive IT & Lifecycle Solutions, Including Consulting, Managed and Professional Services, and Financing
 
We seek to become the primary provider of IT solutions for each of our customers, whether on-premise, cloud, or managed services-based. We strive to provide excellent customer service, pricing, availability, and advanced professional and managed services in an efficient manner. We believe the increasing complexity of the IT ecosystem and the emergence of new technologies and vendors are factors that will lead to a growing demand from existing customers. We have a large number of experienced pre-sales engineers who are able to engage with customers about the most advanced technologies. Our account executives are trained on our broad solutions capabilities and to sell in a consultative manner that increases the likelihood of cross-selling our solutions, and are supported by experienced and professional inside sales representatives. We believe that our bundled offerings are an important differentiating factor from our competitors.
 
We focus on gaining top-level engineering certifications and professional services expertise in advanced technologies of strategic vendors. This expertise helps our customers develop their cloud capabilities including private, public, and hybrid infrastructures. We are providing virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications, collaboration, networking, security, storage, big-data, mobility, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, and managed services offerings, all of which remain in high demand. We believe our ability to deliver advanced professional services provides benefits in two ways. First, we gain recognition and mindshare of our strategic vendor partners and become the “go-to” partner in selected regional markets as well as the national market. This significantly increases direct and referral sales opportunities for our products and services, and allows us to offer competitive pricing levels. Second, within our existing and potential customer base, our advanced professional services are a key differentiator against competitors who cannot provide services or advanced services for these key technologies or across multiple vendor product lines.
 
During the last fiscal year, we have expanded our managed services offerings to include support for certain Palto Alto products, expanded our unified communications offerings to include call recording and support of Software Defined Networking with LiveAction performance analytics. We broadened our partner network to include additional security operations services, managed desktop services, and patch management.
 
Build Our Geographic Footprint
 
We intend to increase our direct sales and go-to-market capabilities in each of our geographic areas. We actively seek to acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, electronic commerce, leveraging our partnerships with vendors, and targeted demand-generation activities to increase awareness of our solutions. We also seek to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic reach, and improve our technology and professional services delivery capabilities.

Recruit, Retain and Develop Employees
 
Based on our prior experience, capital structure, and business systems and processes, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of hiring experienced sales people and engineers, make strategic acquisitions that expand our customer facing talent, broaden our customer base, expand our geographic reach, scale our existing operating structure, and/or enhance our product and service offerings. Part of our growth strategy is to hire purposefully, and evaluate strategic hiring opportunities if and when they become available. During the year ended March 31, 2018, as part of our expansion strategy, our customer facing sales and professional services team grew from 893 to 965.
Improve Operational Efficiencies
 
We continue to invest in our internal technology infrastructure and software platforms to optimize our operations, and engage in process re-engineering efforts to become more streamlined and cost effective.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We incur software development costs associated with maintaining, enhancing, or upgrading our proprietary software, which may be performed by internal IT development resources or by an offshore software-development company that we use to supplement our internal development team.
SALES AND MARKETING
 
We focus our sales and marketing efforts on becoming the primary provider of IT solutions for each of our customers. We seek to acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, leveraging our partnerships with manufacturers and targeted direct marketing to increase awareness of our solutions. We target commercial enterprises, primarily middle market companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2.5 billion and large companies, as well as larger state and local governments and educational institutions. We currently have over 3,200 customers. We undertake direct marketing campaigns to target certain markets in conjunction with our primary vendor partners, who may provide financial reimbursement, outsourced services, and personnel to assist us in these efforts.
 
Our sales representatives are compensated by a combination of salary and commission, with commission becoming the primary component of compensation as the sales representatives gain experience. To date, we acquired a majority of our customers through the efforts of our direct sales force and acquisitions. We market to different areas within a customer’s organization, including business units as well as the IT department, or finance department, depending on the solutions.
 
As of March 31, 2018, our sales force consisted of 499 sales, marketing and sales support personnel organized regionally in 39 office locations throughout the United States, United Kingdom, India, and Singapore.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 
Our success depends in part upon proprietary business methodologies and technologies that we have licensed and modified. We own certain software programs or have entered into software licensing agreements to provide services to our customers. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret protection, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection.
 
For example in the United States we have six catalog management patents, a patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network, a hosted asset information management patent, and an eCatalog supplier portal patent, among others. The earliest of the catalog management patents is scheduled to expire in 2024; and the patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network is scheduled to expire in 2025, provided that all maintenance fees are paid in accordance with USPTO regulations. We also have certain patent rights in some European forums, Japan, and Canada. We cannot provide assurance that any patents, as issued, will prevent the development of competitive products or that our patents will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through the administrative process or litigation.
 
 10
 

Our trademarks in the United States include e+ ®, ePlus®, eCloud ®, Procure+®, Manage+®, Docpak®, Viewmark®, OneSource®, and Where Technology Means More®. We intend to use and protect these and our other marks, as we deem necessary. We believe our trademarks have significant value and are an important factor in the marketing of our products. In addition to our trademarks, we have over 20 registered copyrights and additional common-law trademarks and copyrights.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and can be expensive, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy could be expected to be a persistent problem. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our proprietary intellectual property.
 
FINANCIAL AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
 
Inventory Management: We have drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and distributors, which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery of the equipment. Arrow Enterprises, Ingram Micro, Tech Data, Westcon-Comstor, and Synnex Corporation are our largest distributors. Using the distribution systems available, we frequently sell products that are shipped from the vendors or distributors directly to our customers’ location, which allows us to keep our inventory of any product and shipping expenses to a minimum. For the year ended March 31, 2018, our five largest distributors accounted for 33% of our purchases related to our technology segment net sales.
 
Sales of products manufactured by Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP, Inc. (collectively, “Hewlett Packard companies”), and NetApp, whether purchased directly from these vendors or through distributors, represented 43%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of our technology segment net sales for the year ended March 31, 2018. Our flexible platform and customizable catalogs facilitate the addition of new vendors with minimal incremental effort.
 
Risk Management and Process Controls: We use and maintain conservative underwriting policies and disciplined credit approval processes in both our technology and financing segments. We have an executive management review process and other internal controls in place to evaluate transactions’ potential risk.
 
In our technology segment, we manage our risk by using conservative credit quality analysis and periodic monitoring of customer financial results or third-party risk evaluation tools; monitoring customer accounts receivable balances and payment history; proactively pursuing delinquent accounts; ensuring we have appropriate contractual terms and conditions; perfecting security interests when practicable; requiring prepayment or deposits if indicated; performing fraud checks for new accounts; and evaluating general economic as well as industry specific trends. Our systems automatically decrease trade credit lines based on assigned risk ratings.
 
In our financing segment, we manage our risk in assets we finance by assigning the contractual payments due under the financing arrangement to third-parties. We also use agency purchase orders to procure equipment for lease to our customers and otherwise take measures to minimize our inventory of financed assets.
