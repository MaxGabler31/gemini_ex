ITEM 1.BUSINESS
​
General
​
Introduction
​
We are a diversified natural resource company that generates operating income from the production and marketing of coal and royalty income from coal and oil & gas mineral interests located in strategic producing regions across the United States. The primary focus of our business is to maximize the value of our existing mineral assets, both in the production of coal from our mining assets and the leasing and development of our coal and oil & gas mineral ownership. We believe that our diverse and rich resource base will allow us to continue to create long-term value for unitholders.
​
We are currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern United States with seven operating underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia as well as a coal-loading terminal in Indiana on the Ohio River. We manage and report our coal operations under two regions, Illinois Basin and Appalachia. We market our coal production to major domestic and international utilities and industrial users. 
​
We currently own both mineral and royalty interests in approximately 1.5 million gross acres in premier oil & gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Permian, Anadarko, and Williston Basins. While we own both mineral and royalty interests, we refer to them collectively as mineral interests throughout our discussions of our business as the majority of our holdings are mineral interests. We market our mineral interests for lease to operators in those regions and generate royalty income from the leasing and development of those mineral interests. Reserve additions and the associated cash flows are expected to increase from the development of our existing mineral interests and through acquisitions of additional mineral interests. 
​
We currently have approximately 547.1 million tons of proven and probable coal mineral reserves and 1.17 billion tons of measured, indicated and inferred coal mineral resources in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. All of our measured, indicated and inferred coal mineral resources and 422.9 million tons of our coal mineral reserves are owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties, which are (a) leased or subleased to internal mining complexes or (b) near other internal and external coal mining operations but not yet leased. We market our coal mineral reserves and resources to the coal mining operations that are able to access them and generate royalty income from the leasing and development of those coal mineral reserves and resources.
​
In addition, we develop and market industrial, mining and technology products and services.

ARLP, a Delaware limited partnership, completed its initial public offering on August 19, 1999, and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "ARLP." We are managed by our sole general partner, MGP, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a non-economic general partner interest in ARLP. 
 ​
AllDale I & II Acquisition
​
On January 3, 2019 (the "Acquisition Date"), we acquired the general partner interests and all of the limited partner interests not owned by Cavalier Minerals JV, LLC ("Cavalier Minerals") in AllDale Minerals, LP ("AllDale I") and AllDale Minerals II, LP ("AllDale II", and collectively with AllDale I, "AllDale I & II") for $176.2 million (the "AllDale Acquisition"). ARLP indirectly owns a 96.0% non-managing member interest and a non-economic managing member interest in Cavalier Minerals. The AllDale Acquisition provided us with diversified exposure to industry-leading operators.
​
Wing Acquisition
​
On August 2, 2019, our subsidiary AR Midland, LP ("AR Midland") acquired from Wing Resources LLC and Wing Resources II LLC (collectively, "Wing") approximately 9,000 oil & gas net royalty acres in the Midland Basin for $144.9 million (the "Wing Acquisition"). The Wing Acquisition enhanced our ownership position in the Permian Basin and expanded our exposure to industry-leading operators.
​
Boulders Acquisition
​
On October 13, 2021, AR Midland acquired approximately 1,480 oil & gas net royalty acres in the Delaware Basin from Boulders Royalty Corp. ("Boulders") for a purchase price of $31.0 million (the "Boulders Acquisition"). The Boulders Acquisition also enhanced our ownership position in the Permian Basin. 
​
These acquisitions furthered our business strategy to grow our Oil & Gas Royalties segment through accretive acquisitions. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3 – Acquisitions" for more information. We now hold approximately 57,000 net royalty acres in premier oil & gas resource plays.

Coal Mining Operations
​
Coal is used primarily for the generation of electric power and production of steel but is also used for chemical, food, and cement processing. We produce bituminous coal from our underground mines that is sold to customers principally for electric power generation (thermal) and the production of steel (metallurgical). We have established long-term relationships with customers through exemplary and consistent performance while operating our mines with an industry-leading safety record.
​
At December 31, 2021, our mining operations had access to approximately 547.1 million tons of proven and probable coal mineral reserves and 1.17 billion tons of measured, indicated and inferred coal mineral resources in Illinois, Indiana, 

3




Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. All of our measured, indicated and inferred coal mineral resources and 422.9 million tons of our coal mineral reserves are owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties and are currently leased or subleased or held for lease or sublease to our mining operations or others. We produce a diverse range of thermal and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers. In 2021, we sold 32.3 million tons of coal and produced 32.2 million tons. Of the 32.3 million tons sold, approximately two-thirds was leased from Alliance Resource Properties. The coal we sold in 2021 was approximately 14.2% low-sulfur coal, 50.3% medium-sulfur coal, and 35.5% high-sulfur coal. In 2021, approximately 81.6% of our tons sold were purchased by domestic electric utilities and 12.5% were sold into the international markets through brokered transactions. The balance of our tons sold was to third-party resellers and industrial consumers. For tons sold to domestic electric utilities, 99.9% were sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. The Btu content of our coal ranges from 11,450 to 13,200.

​
We lease most of our coal mineral reserves and resources from Alliance Resource Properties or private parties and generally have the right to maintain leases in force until the exhaustion of mineable and merchantable coal located within the leased premises or a larger coal mineral reserve or resource area. These leases provide for royalties to be paid to the lessors at a fixed amount per ton or as a percentage of the sales price. Many leases require payment of minimum royalties, payable either at the time of the execution of the lease or in periodic installments, even if no mining activities have begun.

These minimum royalties are normally credited against the production royalties owed to a lessor once coal production has commenced.
​
Illinois Basin Operations
​
Our Illinois Basin mining operations are located in western Kentucky, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana. As of December 31, 2021, we have 1,862 employees, and we operate four active mining complexes in the Illinois Basin.

is shipped via the CSX railroad directly to customers or various transloading facilities on the Ohio River for barge deliveries, or by truck directly to customers or to various docks on the Big Sandy River for barge deliveries. 
​
Mettiki Complex. The Mettiki Complex ("Mettiki") comprises the Mountain View mine located in Tucker County, West Virginia operated by our subsidiary Mettiki Coal (WV), LLC ("Mettiki (WV)") and a preparation plant located near the city of Oakland in Garrett County, Maryland operated by our subsidiary Mettiki Coal, LLC ("Mettiki (MD)"). Mettiki (WV) and began longwall mining in November 2006. The Mountain View mine produces medium-sulfur coal, which is transported by truck either to the Mettiki (MD) preparation plant for processing for shipment into the metallurgical coal market or otherwise, or directly to the coal blending facility at the Virginia Electric and Power Company Mt. Storm Power Station. The Mettiki (MD) preparation plant has throughput capacity of 1,350 tons of raw coal per hour. Coal processed at the preparation plant can be trucked to the blending facility at Mt. Storm or shipped via the CSX railroad, which provides the opportunity to ship into the domestic and international thermal and metallurgical coal markets.
​
Tunnel Ridge Complex.  Our subsidiary, Tunnel Ridge, LLC ("Tunnel Ridge"), operates the Tunnel Ridge mine, an underground longwall mine in the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal seam, located near Wheeling, West Virginia. Longwall mining operations began at Tunnel Ridge in May 2012. The Tunnel Ridge preparation plant has throughput capacity of 2,000 tons of raw coal per hour. Coal produced from the Tunnel Ridge mine is a medium/high-sulfur coal and is transported by conveyor belt to a barge loading facility on the Ohio River. Tunnel Ridge has the ability through a third-party facility to transload coal from barges for rail shipment on the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway with connections to the CSX and the NS railroads.
​
Coal Marketing and Sales
​
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of existing business relationships or through formal bidding processes. As is customary in the coal industry, we have entered into long-term coal supply agreements with many of our customers. These arrangements are mutually beneficial to our customers and us in that they provide greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices. Although some utility customers have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2021 approximately 77.9% and 75.1% of our sales tonnage and total coal sales, respectively, were sold under long-term contracts with committed term expirations ranging from 2021 to 2026. As of February 11, 2022, our nominal commitment under contract was approximately 33.1 million tons for delivery in 2022. The contractual time commitments for customers to nominate future purchase volumes under these contracts are typically sufficient to allow us to balance our sales commitments with prospective production capacity. 
​
The provisions of long-term contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer. As a result, the provisions of these contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price and contract reopener terms, permitted sources of supply, force majeure provisions, and coal qualities and quantities. A portion of our long-term contracts is subject to price adjustment provisions, which periodically permit an increase or decrease in the contract price, typically to reflect changes in specified indices or changes in production costs resulting from regulatory changes, or both. These provisions, however, may not assure that the contract price will reflect every change in production or other costs. Failure of the parties to agree on a price pursuant to an adjustment or a reopener provision can, in some instances, lead to the early termination of a contract. Some of the long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract. The long-term contracts typically stipulate procedures for transportation of coal, quality control, sampling, and weighing. Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatility, and other qualities. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments, or termination of the contracts. While most of the contracts specify the approved seams and/or approved locations from which the coal is to be mined, some contracts allow the coal to be sourced from more than one mine or location. Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the buyers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits. Coal contracts typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of specified events. Force majeure events include but are not limited to unexpected significant geological conditions and weather events that may disrupt transportation. Depending on the language of the contract, some contracts may terminate upon an event of force majeure that extends for a certain period.
​
The international coal market has been a part of our business with indirect sales to end-users in Europe, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. Our sales into the international coal market are considered exports and are made 

7




through brokered transactions. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, export tons represented approximately 12.5%, 3.3%, and 17.9% of tons sold, respectively. Because title to our export shipments typically transfers to our brokerage customers at a point that does not necessarily reflect the end-usage point, we attribute export tons to the country with the end-usage point, if known. 
​
Reliance on Major Customers
​
In 2021, we derived more than 10% of our total revenue from Louisville Gas and Electric Company. We did not derive 10% or more of our revenues from any other single customer. For more information about this customer, please read "Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplemental Data—Note 23 – Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers."
​
Coal Competition
​
The coal industry is intensely competitive. The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality (including sulfur and heat content), reliability and diversity of supply, and transportation costs from the mine to the customer. We are currently the second-largest coal producer in the eastern United States. Our principal competitors include American Consolidated Natural Resources Inc., CONSOL Energy, Inc., Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc., Foresight Energy LP, and Peabody Energy Corporation. We also compete directly with smaller producers in the Illinois Basin and Appalachian regions. In addition, we seek to export a portion of our coal into the international coal markets and we compete with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries.
​
The prices we are able to obtain for our export coal have been influenced by a number of factors, such as global economic conditions, weather patterns, and global supply and demand, among others. The prices we are able to obtain for our domestic sales of coal are primarily linked to coal consumption patterns of domestic electricity-generating utilities, which in turn are influenced by economic activity, government regulations, weather, and technological developments, as well as the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel and alternative energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear energy, petroleum and renewable energy sources for electrical power generation.
​
For additional information, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
​
Coal Transportation
​
Our coal is transported from our mining complexes to our customers by barge, rail, and truck reflecting important flexibility advantages in supplying our customers. Depending on the proximity of the customer to the mining complex and the transportation available for delivering coal to that customer, transportation costs can be a substantial part of the total delivered cost of a customer's coal. As a consequence, the availability and cost of transportation constitute important factors in the marketability of coal. We believe our mines are located in favorable geographic locations that minimize transportation costs for our customers, and in many cases, we can accommodate multiple transportation options. Our customers typically negotiate and pay the transportation costs from the mining complex to the destination, which is the standard practice in the industry. Approximately 53.1% of our 2021 sales volume was initially shipped from the mining complexes by barge, 31.9% was shipped from the mining complexes by rail, and 15.0% was shipped from the mining complexes by truck. The practices of, rates set by and capacity availability of, the transportation company serving a particular mine or customer may affect, either adversely or favorably, our marketing efforts with respect to coal produced from the relevant mining complex. With respect to our export volumes from the United States to other countries, we generally sell coal to our customers at an export terminal in the United States and we are responsible for the cost of transporting coal to the export terminals. Our export customers generally negotiate and pay for ocean vessel transportation.
​
Mineral Interest Activities
​
Our mineral interest activities include both oil & gas and coal mineral interests. Our oil & gas mineral interest business includes all activities related to the oil & gas mineral interests held by AR Midland and AllDale I & II and includes Alliance Minerals' equity interest in AllDale Minerals III, L.P. ("AllDale III"). AR Midland acquired its mineral interests in the Wing and Boulders Acquisitions. Our mineral interests are primarily located on private lands in three basins, which are also our areas of focus for future development by operators. These include the Permian (Delaware and Midland), Anadarko (SCOOP/STACK), and Williston (Bakken) Basins. Our developed and undeveloped net acres standardized to a 1/8th royalty equate to approximately 57,000 oil & gas net royalty acres, including 3,976 oil & gas net royalty acres owned through our equity interest in AllDale III.

8




​
Our coal mineral interests include all of our measured, indicated and inferred coal mineral resources and 422.9 million tons of coal mineral reserves which are owned or leased by Alliance Resource Properties and are (a) leased or subleased to internal mining complexes or (b) near other internal and external coal mining operations but not yet leased. Our coal mineral interests are located in both the Illinois Basin and the Appalachia Basin.
​
Oil & Gas Royalties
​
When our oil & gas mineral interests are leased, we typically receive an upfront cash payment, known as lease bonus, and we retain a mineral royalty, which entitles us to receive a fixed percentage of the revenue or production from the oil & gas produced from the acreage underlying our interests, free of lease operating expenses and capital costs. A lessee can extend the lease beyond the initial lease term with continuous drilling, production, or other operating activities, or by making an extension payment. When production or drilling ceases, the lease terminates, allowing us to lease the exploration and development rights to another party. As an owner of mineral interests, we incur the initial cost to acquire our interests but thereafter only incur our proportionate share of production and ad valorem taxes. Unlike owners of working interests in oil & gas properties, we are not obligated to fund drilling and completion costs, lease operating expenses or plugging and abandonment costs associated with oil & gas production.
​
The following chart summarizes the production of our oil & gas mineral interests for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:

​
The following map shows the location of our oil & gas mineral interests:
​
​
In 2014, we began to invest in oil & gas mineral interests in some of the nation's premier oil-rich basins. Beginning in 2019, we transitioned from a passive investor in mineral interests to an active and material participant in oil & gas minerals. 
​
Permian Basin—Delaware and Midland Basins
​
The Permian Basin ranges from West Texas into southeastern New Mexico and is currently the most active area for horizontal drilling in the United States. The Permian Basin is further subdivided into the Delaware Basin in the west and the Midland Basin in the east. Based on geologic data and the ongoing development by operators, our mineral interests in the Permian Basin contain multiple producing zones of economic horizontal development including but not limited to the Wolfcamp, Spraberry, and Bone Spring formations. Our recent purchase of acreage located entirely in the Permian Basin through the Boulders Acquisition demonstrates our commitment to continued acquisition of mineral interests in the nation's highest growth oil & gas plays.
​
Anadarko Basin—SCOOP and STACK Plays
​
The SCOOP play (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) is located in central Oklahoma in Grady, Garvin, Stephens, and McClain Counties. Based on geologic data and the ongoing development by operators, our mineral interests in the SCOOP play contain multiple producing zones of economic horizontal development including multiple Woodford benches and the Springer Shale. In addition, operators are also currently testing other formations in the area including the Sycamore, Caney, and Osage, which is also referred to as SCORE (Sycamore Caney Osage Resource Expansion). The STACK play (derived from Sooner Trend, Anadarko Basin, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) is located in central Oklahoma in Kingfisher, Canadian, Caddo, and Blaine Counties. Based on geologic data and the ongoing development by operators, 

10




our mineral interests in the STACK play contain multiple producing zones of economic horizontal development including but not limited to the Meramec and Woodford formations.
​
Williston Basin—Bakken
​
The Williston Basin stretches from western North Dakota into eastern Montana. Based on geologic data and ongoing development by operators, our mineral interests contain multiple producing zones of economic horizontal development including the Bakken and Three Forks formations.
​
Other
​
Our other interests are comprised primarily of mineral interests owned in the Appalachia Basin that stretches throughout most of Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and extends into other states. The Appalachia Basin's most active plays in which we have acreage are the Marcellus Shale and Utica plays, which cover most of Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, and eastern Ohio. In addition to the interests held in the Appalachia Basin, we own a small number of mineral interests in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play in Mississippi. AllDale III also owns mineral interests in the Haynesville Shale formation located in northwest Louisiana.
​
Coal Royalties
​
Our Coal Royalties segment includes approximately 422.9 million tons of proven and probable reserves and all of the 1.17 billion tons of our measured, indicated and inferred coal mineral resources. Our coal mineral reserves and resources are located in the Appalachia and Illinois Basins in the United States. We lease our reserves and resources to our mining complexes under long-term leases. Approximately two-thirds of our royalty-based leases have initial terms of five to 40 years, with substantially all lessees having the option to extend the lease for additional terms. 
​
Under our standard royalty lease, we grant the lessees the right to mine and sell our reserves and resources in exchange for royalty payments based on a percentage of the sale price or a fixed royalty per ton of coal mined and sold. Lessees calculate royalty payments due to us and are required to report tons of coal mined and sold as well as the sales prices of the extracted coal.

​
Minerals Interest Competition
​
Many companies are engaged in the search for and the acquisition of coal and oil & natural gas interests, and there is a limited supply of desirable coal and oil & natural gas reserves. Our ability to acquire additional oil & gas mineral interests in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors not only own and acquire oil & gas mineral interests but also explore for and produce oil & gas and, in some cases, conduct midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. By engaging in such other activities, our competitors may be able to develop or obtain information that is superior to the information that is available to us. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in the oil & gas industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for oil & gas properties. Further, oil & gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal, and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil & gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations, and the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other forms of energy, may affect the demand for oil & gas.
​
We also face competition from land companies, coal producers and international steel companies in purchasing coal mineral reserves and resources as well as royalty producing properties. Numerous producers in the coal industry make coal marketing very competitive. Our mining complexes in which we lease our reserves compete with coal producers in various regions of the United States for domestic sales on the basis of coal price at the mine, coal quality, transportation cost from the mine to the customer, and the reliability of supply. Continued demand for our coal and the prices that our lessees obtain are also affected by demand for electricity and steel, as well as government regulations, technological developments, and the availability and the cost of generating power from alternative fuel sources, including nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.
​
For additional information, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors".
​
Minerals Interest - Seasonal Nature of Business
​
Generally, demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while demand for natural gas increases during the winter and summer months and decreases during the spring and fall months. Certain buyers of natural gas use natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil & gas operations in a portion of our leasing areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for our operators in meeting well-drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies, and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.
​
Other Operations
​
Coal Brokerage
​
As markets allow, Alliance Coal buys coal from our mining operations and outside producers principally throughout the eastern United States, which we then resell. We have a policy of matching our outside coal purchases and sales to minimize market risks associated with buying and reselling coal. 
​
Matrix Group
​
Our subsidiaries, Matrix Design Group, LLC ("Matrix Design") and its subsidiaries Matrix Design International, LLC and Matrix Design Africa (PTY) LTD, and Alliance Design Group, LLC ("Alliance Design") (collectively the Matrix Design entities and Alliance Design are referred to as the "Matrix Group"), provide a variety of technology products and services for our mining operations and certain industrial and mining technology products and services to third parties. Matrix Group's products and services include data network, communication and tracking systems, mining proximity detection systems, industrial collision avoidance systems, and data and analytics software. We acquired Matrix Design in September 2006.
​

Additional Services
​
We develop and market additional services to establish ourselves as the supplier of choice for our customers. Historically, and in 2021, outside revenues from these services were immaterial.
​
Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations
​
Our coal operations, and those of the operators on the properties in which we hold oil & gas mineral interests, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local authorities on matters such as:
​

● | employee health and safety;
--+----------------------------


● | permits and other licensing requirements for mining or exploration and production activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | air quality standards;
--+-----------------------


● | water quality standards;
--+-------------------------


● | storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws or that, if spilled, could reach waterways or wetlands;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | plant and wildlife protection that could limit or prohibit mining or exploration and production activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict the types, quantities, and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of mining or exploration and production activities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of waste ponds, mining areas, drilling pits, and plugging of abandoned wells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | storage and handling of explosives;
--+------------------------------------


● | wetlands protection;
--+---------------------


● | surface subsidence from underground mining; and
--+------------------------------------------------


● | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. The regulatory burden on fossil-fuel industries increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly obligations could increase our or our mineral interest operators’ costs and adversely affect our performance.
​
In addition, the utility industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which has adversely affected the demand for coal. It is possible that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, or that existing laws or regulations may be differently interpreted or more stringently enforced, any of which could have a significant impact on our mining operations, our customers' ability to use coal, or the value of or amount of royalties received from our mineral interests. For more information, please see the risk factors described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" below.
​
We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. However, because of the extensive and detailed nature of these regulatory requirements, particularly the regulatory system of the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") where citations can be issued without regard to fault and many of the standards include subjective elements, it is not reasonable to expect any coal mining company to be free of citations. When we receive a citation, we attempt to promptly remediate any identified condition. While we have not quantified all of the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and associated regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for domestic coal producers.
​
Expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years. We have accrued for the present value of the estimated cost of asset retirement obligations and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge, when necessary. The accruals for asset retirement obligations and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the estimated costs and timing assumptions of asset retirement obligations and mine closing procedures. Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were insufficient.

15




​
Mining Permits and Approvals
​
Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations. Applications for permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation and must address a variety of environmental, health, and safety matters associated with a proposed mining operation. These matters include the manner and sequencing of coal extraction, the storage, use, and disposal of waste and other substances and impacts on the environment, the construction of water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal extraction. Meeting all requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time-consuming and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations.
​
The permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years and can be subject to administrative and judicial challenges, including by the public. Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits in the future or that a current permit will not be revoked.
​
We are required to post bonds to secure performance under our permits. Under some circumstances, substantial fines and penalties, including revocation of mining permits, may be imposed under the laws and regulations described above. Monetary sanctions and, in severe circumstances, criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. Regulations also provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations that have outstanding environmental violations. Although like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of our business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.
​
Mine Health and Safety Laws
​
The operation of our mines is subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("FMSHA"), and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. FMSHA imposes extensive and detailed safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations, and numerous other matters. MSHA monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations. In addition, most of the states where we operate have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal mining industry are perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous system in the United States for the protection of employee safety and have a significant effect on our operating costs. Although many of the requirements primarily impact underground mining, our competitors in all of the areas in which we operate are subject to the same laws and regulations.
​
FMSHA has been construed as authorizing MSHA to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability, or liability without fault, and FMSHA requires the imposition of a civil penalty for each cited violation. Negligence and gravity assessments, along with other factors, can result in the issuance of various types of orders, including orders requiring withdrawal from the mine or the affected area, and some orders can also result in the imposition of civil penalties. FMSHA also contains criminal liability provisions. For example, criminal liability may be imposed upon corporate operators who knowingly and willfully authorize, order, or carry out violations of the FMSHA, or its mandatory health and safety standards.
​
The Federal Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 ("MINER Act") significantly amended the FMSHA, imposing more extensive and stringent compliance standards, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection, and enforcement activities. Following the passage of the MINER Act, MSHA has issued new or more stringent rules and policies on a variety of topics, including:
​

● | sealing off abandoned areas of underground coal mines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | mine safety equipment, training, and emergency reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | training and availability of mine rescue teams;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | underground "refuge alternatives" capable of sustaining trapped miners in the event of an emergency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | flame-resistant conveyor belts, fire prevention and detection, and use of air from the belt entry; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-accident two-way communications and electronic tracking systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

16




​
MSHA continues to interpret and implement various provisions of the MINER Act, along with introducing new proposed regulations and standards.
​
In 2014, MSHA began implementation of a finalized new regulation titled "Lowering Miner's Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors." The final rule implemented a reduction in the allowable respirable coal mine dust exposure limits, requires the use of sampling data taken from a single sample rather than an average of samples, and increases oversight by MSHA regarding coal mine dust and ventilation issues at each mine, including the approval process for ventilation plans at each mine, all of which increase mining costs. The second phase of the rule began in February 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor technology, which provides real-time dust exposure information to the miner. Phase three of the rule began in August 2016 and resulted in lowering the current respirable dust level of 2.0 milligrams per cubic meter to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air. Compliance with these rules can result in increased costs on our operations, including, but not limited to, the purchasing of new equipment and the hiring of additional personnel to assist with monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations. MSHA has published a request for information regarding engineering controls and best practices to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust, which is currently set to close on July 9, 2022. It is uncertain whether MSHA will present additional proposed rules, or revisions to the final rule, following the closing of the comment period for the current request for information.
​
MSHA has also published, and may continue to publish, various proposed rules or requests for information, which may result in additional rulemakings. For example:
​

● | In June 2016, MSHA published a request for information on Exposure of Underground Miners to Diesel Exhaust. Following a comment period that closed in November 2016 for this matter, MSHA received requests for MSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to hold a Diesel Exhaust Partnership to address the issues covered by MSHA's 2016 request for information. The comment period for the request for information for the Diesel Exhaust Partnership closed in September 2020. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In August 2019, MSHA published a request for information regarding exposure to respirable crystalline silica, most commonly found in the mining environment through quartz. The request solicited information regarding best practices to protect miners’ health from exposure to quartz, including examination of a new reduced permissible exposure limit, potential new or developing protective technologies, and/or technical and educational assistance. The comment period for the request for information closed in October 2019. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In November 2020, MSHA published a proposed rule to revise Testing, Evaluation, and Approval of Electric Motor-Driven Mine Equipment and Accessories within underground mining environments. The comment period for the proposed rule closed in December 2020. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September 2021, MSHA published a proposed rule requiring that mine operators employing six or more miners develop and implement a written safety program for mobile and powered haulage equipment at surface mines and surface areas of underground mines (Safety Program for Surface Mobile Equipment). The comment period for the proposed rule closed in November 2021. However, MHSA reopened the rulemaking record for additional public comments. A virtual hearing was held in January 2022 and the comment period closed in February 2022.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a final rule addressing any of the above issues or any of the other various proposed rules or requests for information or whether any such rule would have material impacts on our operations or our costs of operation. 
​
Subsequent to the passage of the MINER Act, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have enacted legislation addressing issues such as mine safety and accident reporting, increased civil and criminal penalties, and increased inspections and oversight. Additionally, state administrative agencies can promulgate administrative rules and regulations affecting our operations. Other states may pass similar legislation or administrative regulations in the future.
​
Some of the costs of complying with existing regulations and implementing new safety and health regulations may be passed on to our customers. Although we have not quantified the full impact, implementing and complying with these new federal and state safety laws and regulations have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
​

Black Lung Benefits Act
​
The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981 ("BLBA") requires businesses that conduct current mining operations to make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease, to some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease, and to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims. The coal we sell into international markets is generally not subject to this tax. In addition, the BLBA provides that some claims for which coal operators had previously been responsible are or will become obligations of the government trust funded by the tax. Effective January 1, 2019, the trust fund was funded by an excise tax on production of up to $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and up to $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 2% of the applicable sales price. Effective January 1, 2020, the trust fund was funded by an excise tax on coal sold of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. Effective January 1, 2022, the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on production of up to $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and up to $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 2% of the applicable sales price. It is uncertain as to whether the excise tax rates will be adjusted in the future or whether any such modifications would be retroactive.
​
Workers' Compensation and Black Lung
​
We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. Workers' compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment-related deaths. We generally self-insure this potential expense using our actuary estimates of the cost of present and future claims. In addition, coal mining companies are subject to federal legislation and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or black lung. We also provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Our pneumoconiosis benefits liability is calculated using the service cost method based on the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis benefits obligation. Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents, and discount rates. For more information concerning our requirement to maintain bonds to secure our workers' compensation obligations, see the discussion of surety bonds below under "—Bonding Requirements."
​
The revised BLBA regulations took effect in January 2001, relaxing the stringent award criteria established under previous regulations and thus potentially allowing new federal claims to be awarded and allowing previously denied claimants to refile under the revised criteria. These regulations may also increase black lung-related medical costs by broadening the scope of conditions for which medical costs are reimbursable and increase legal costs by shifting more of the burden of proof to the employer.
​
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, includes significant changes to the federal black lung program retroactive to 2005, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes have caused a significant increase in our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.
​
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
​
The Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 ("SMCRA") and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation, and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of deep mining. Although we have minimal surface mining activity and no mountaintop removal mining activity, SMCRA nevertheless requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of our mining activities.
​
SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans. SMCRA requires us to restore the surface to approximate the original contours as contemporaneously as practicable with the completion of surface mining operations. Federal law and some states impose on mine operators the responsibility for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of longwall mining and possibly other mining operations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
​

18




In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed before 1977. The fee expired on September 30, 2021, and was reauthorized through September 30, 2034, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which was signed on November 15, 2021. The fee, as reauthorized, for surface-mined and underground-mined coal is $0.224 per ton and $0.096 per ton, respectively, through September 30, 2034. We have accrued the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary. Please read "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18 – Asset Retirement Obligations." In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation or orphaned mine sites and acid mine drainage control on a statewide basis. 
​
Under SMCRA, responsibility for unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties, and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators and other third parties can be imputed to other companies that are deemed, according to the regulations, to have "owned" or "controlled" the third-party violator. Sanctions against the "owner" or "controller" are quite severe and can include being blocked from receiving new permits and having any permits revoked that were issued after the time of the violations or after the time civil penalties or reclamation fees became due. We are not aware of any currently pending or asserted claims against us relating to the "ownership" or "control" theories discussed above. However, we cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted in the future.
​
In April 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") finalized rules on coal combustion residuals ("CCRs"); however, the final rule does not address the placement of CCRs in minefills or non-minefill uses of CCRs at coal mine sites. The Federal Office of Surface Mining ("OSM") has announced its intention to release a proposed rule to regulate placement and use of CCRs at coal mine sites, but, to date, no further action has been taken. These actions by OSM potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, prohibitions or restrictions relating to mining activities, and additional enforcement actions.
​
Bonding Requirements
​
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers' compensation, to pay certain black lung claims, and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for us and for our competitors to secure new surety bonds without posting collateral and in some cases it is unclear what level of collateral will be required. In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us. It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by federal and state laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow. For additional information, please see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Requirements."
​
Air Emissions
​
The CAA and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate emissions into the air and affect coal mining, as well as oil & gas, operations. The CAA imposes permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, achieve certain emissions standards, or implement certain work practices on sources that emit various air pollutants. The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other coal-burning facilities. There have been a series of federal rulemakings focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. Installation of additional emissions control technology and any additional measures required under applicable federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans ("SIPs"), could make fossil fuels a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future. A significant reduction in fossil fuels’ share of power generating capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
​

19




In addition to the greenhouse gas ("GHG") issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may affect our operations or the operations of those on the properties in which we hold mineral interests, directly or indirectly, include but are not limited to the following:
​

● | The EPA's Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility's sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA's Acid Rain Program by switching to lower-sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or "scrubbers," or by reducing electricity-generating levels. In 2021, we sold 81.6% of our total tons to electric utilities in the United States, substantially all of which was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These requirements would not be supplanted by a replacement rule for the Clean Air Interstate Rule ("CAIR"), discussed below. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | The CAIR calls for power plants in 28 states and Washington, D.C. to reduce emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pursuant to a cap-and-trade program similar to the system in effect for acid rain. In June 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"), a replacement rule for CAIR, which would have required 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. CSAPR has become increasingly irrelevant with continuing coal plant retirements making the nitrogen oxide ozone budget less stringent and lowering emission allowance prices to levels closer to average operating cost for many of our customers. The full impacts of CSAPR are unknown at the present time due to the implementation of Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS"), discussed below, and the impact of the continuing coal plant retirements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | In February 2012, the EPA adopted the MATS, which regulates the emission of mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride from coal and oil-fired power plants. In March 2013, the EPA finalized a reconsideration of the MATS rule as it pertains to new power plants, principally adjusting emissions limits to levels attainable by existing control technologies. In subsequent litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the MATS rule based on the EPA's failure to take costs into consideration. The D.C. Circuit Court allowed the current rule to stay in place until the EPA issued a new finding. In April 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding upholding the rule and concluding that a cost analysis supports the MATS rule. In April 2017, the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals granted the EPA's request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the supplemental finding. In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed Supplemental Cost Finding, as well as the CAA required "risk and technology review." In May 2020, EPA issued a final rule that reverses the Agency’s prior determination from 2000 and 2016 that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate hazardous air pollutants from coal-fueled Electric Generating Units ("EGUs") under the MATS rule. However, in February 2022, EPA published a proposed rule proposing to revoke the May 2020 finding. Although various issues surrounding the MATS rule remain subject to litigation in the D.C. Circuit, the MATS rule has forced electric power generators to make capital investments to retrofit power plants and could lead to additional premature retirements of older coal-fired generating units and many electric power generators have already announced retirements due to the uncertainty surrounding the MATS rule. The announced and possible additional retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. Apart from MATS, several states have enacted or proposed regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, and federal legislation to reduce mercury emissions from power plants has been proposed. Regulation of mercury emissions by the EPA, states, or Congress may decrease the future demand for coal. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with CSAPR Update and MATS and the effects they may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

​

● | The EPA is required by the CAA to periodically reevaluate the available health effects information to determine whether the National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") should be revised. Pursuant to this process, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for fine particulate matter ("PM"), ozone, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards and other states will be required to develop new SIPs

for areas that were previously in "attainment" but do not attain the new standards. In addition, under the revised ozone NAAQS, significant additional emissions control expenditures may be required at coal-fired power plants. In March 2019, the EPA published a final rule that retained the current primary NAAQS for sulfur oxide. In December 2020, EPA published a final rule to retain the current NAAQS for both PM and ozone; however, various entities filed litigation against one or both of these rulemakings, and the Biden Administration has announced that it will reconsider and potentially revise the NAAQS and consider instituting a more stringent standard. New standards may impose additional emissions control requirements on new and expanded coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and our customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states, and developments could indirectly reduce the demand for coal. Separately, the implementation of new standards by states has the potential to delay or otherwise impact oil & gas production activities, which could reduce the profitability of our mineral interests.

​

● | The EPA's regional haze program is designed to protect and improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas, and international parks. Under the program, states are required to develop SIPs to improve visibility. Typically, these plans call for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fueled electric plants. In prior cases, the EPA has decided to negate the SIPs and impose stringent requirements through Federal Implementation Plans ("FIPs"). The regional haze program, including particularly the EPA's FIPs, and any future regulations may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas and may require some existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions. These requirements could limit the demand for coal in some locations. In September 2018, the EPA issued a memorandum that detailed plans to assist states as they develop their SIPs, which was followed by a supplemental memorandum in July 2021 for SIPs for the second implementation period.

​

● | The EPA's new source review ("NSR") program under the CAA in certain circumstances requires existing coal-fired power plants, when modifications to those plants significantly increase emissions, to install more stringent air emissions control equipment. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, has filed lawsuits against a number of coal-fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the NSR program. The EPA has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued under the program. Several of these lawsuits have settled, but others remain pending. In October 2020, the EPA finalized a rule to clarify the process for evaluating whether the NSR permitting program would apply to a proposed modification of a source of air emissions. The EPA has announced that it will review the NSR program. Depending on the ultimate resolution of the EPA's litigation and review, demand for coal could be affected.

​

● | The EPA’s New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") under the CAA require the reduction of certain pollutants and methane emissions from certain stimulated oil & gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as "green completions." These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Although the Trump Administration revised prior regulations in September 2020 to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking, effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. Additionally, in November 2021, EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish new source and first-time existing source standards of performance for GHG and volatile organic compound ("VOC") emissions for crude oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal in 2022 containing additional requirements not included in the November 2021 proposed rule and anticipates the issuance of final rule by the end of the year. Oil & gas production on the properties in which we hold mineral interests could be adversely affected to the extent any final rule imposes increased operating costs on the oil & gas industry.

GHG Emissions
​
Combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal we produce and the oil & gas produced from our mineral interests, results in the emission of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Combustion of fuel for mining equipment used in coal production also emits GHGs. Future regulation of GHG emissions in the United States could occur pursuant to future United States treaty commitments, new domestic legislation, or regulation by the EPA. Although no comprehensive climate change regulation has been adopted at the federal level in the United States, President Biden announced that climate change will be a focus of his administration. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil-fuel industry, a doubling of electricity generated by offshore wind by 2030, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Internationally, the Paris Agreement requires member states to submit non-binding, individually-determined emissions reduction targets. These commitments could further reduce demand and prices for fossil fuels. Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden recommitted the United States in February 2021 and, in April 2021, announced a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. The international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference to the Parties ("COP26") during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, including "all feasible reductions" in the energy sector. Also at COP26, more than forty countries pledged to phase out coal, although the United States did not sign the pledge. The impact of these actions remain unclear at this time. Moreover, many states, regions, and governmental bodies have adopted GHG initiatives and have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. Others have announced their intent to increase the use of renewable energy sources, displacing coal and other fossil fuels. Depending on the particular regulatory program that may be enacted, at either the federal or state level, the demand for coal could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our operations.
​
Even in the absence of new federal legislation, the EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA based on the U.S. Supreme Court's 2007 decision that the EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions. Although the U.S. Supreme Court's holding did not expressly involve the EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources, such as coal-fueled power plants, the EPA has determined on its own that it has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from power plants and issued a final rule which found that GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, endanger both the public health and welfare. Several rulemakings have been issued under the NSPS that constrain the GHG emissions of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In January 2021, the EPA published a final significant contribution finding for purposes of regulating source category of GHG emissions, confirming that such power plants are a source category for such regulations. However, this finding also excludes several sectors and may, therefore, be subject to revision, and future implementation of the NSPS is uncertain at this time.
​
In August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan ("CPP") rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates. Judicial challenges led the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a stay in February 2016 of the implementation of the CPP before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ("Circuit Court") even issued a decision. Then, in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP. The EPA subsequently proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule to replace the CPP with a rule that utilizes heat rate improvement measures as the "best system of emission reduction". The ACE rule adopts new implementing regulations under the CAA to clarify the roles of the EPA and the states, including an extension of the deadline for state plans and EPA approvals; and, the rule revises the NSR permitting program to provide EGUs the opportunity to make efficiency improvements without triggering NSR permit requirements. In June 2019, the EPA published the final repeal of the CPP and promulgation of the ACE rule. The EPA's attempts to replace the CPP with the ACE rule are currently subject to litigation, and on January 19, 2021, the Circuit Court struck down the ACE rule, though the case is not yet final with oral arguments scheduled before the U.S. Supreme Court on February 28, 2022. We cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.
​
Notwithstanding the ACE rule, requirements have led to premature retirements and could lead to additional premature retirements of coal-fired generating units and reduce the demand for coal. Congress has not currently adopted legislation to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants and it is unclear whether the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing and modified power plants as proposed in the NSPS and CPP.

Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the coal we produce or the oil & gas produced from our mineral interests.
​
There have been numerous protests and challenges to the permitting of new fossil-fuel infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines, by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to GHG emissions. For instance, various state regulatory authorities have rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide. In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fueled power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board. In addition, over thirty states have currently adopted "renewable energy standards" or "renewable portfolio standards," which encourage or require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date. Several states have announced their intent to have renewable energy comprise 100% of their electric generation portfolio. Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area. In December 2021, President Biden issued an executive order setting a goal for a carbon pollution-free electricity sector across the country by 2035. To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers or those of our mineral interest producers, they may reduce the demand for fossil-fuel energy and may affect the long-term demand for our coal and the oil & gas producers from the properties in which we hold mineral interests. Finally, while the U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions, the Court did not decide whether similar claims can be brought under state common law. As a result, despite this favorable ruling, tort-type liabilities remain a concern. For more information, see our risk factor titled "We, our customers, or the operators of our oil & gas mineral interests could be subject to litigation related to climate change."
​
In addition, environmental advocacy groups have filed a variety of judicial challenges claiming that the environmental analyses conducted by federal agencies before granting permits and other approvals necessary for certain coal activities do not satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). These groups assert that the environmental analyses in question do not adequately consider the climate change impacts of these particular projects. In July 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ") finalized revisions to NEPA regulations that clarify the extent to which direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts from a proposed project, including GHG emissions, should be examined under NEPA. However, in October 2021, the CEQ published a proposed rule to restore, in general, NEPA regulations that were in effect before being modified by the 2020 revisions. A final rule is expected in 2022. 
​
Many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHG by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, in 2005, ten Northeastern states entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement ("RGGI"), calling for the implementation of a cap and trade program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the participating states. The members of RGGI have established in statutes and/or regulations a carbon dioxide trading program. Auctions for carbon dioxide allowances under the program began in September 2008. Since its inception, several additional states and Canadian provinces have joined RGGI as participants or observers, while Virginia has withdrawn from RGGI via executive order by its governor. 
​
Following the RGGI model, five Western states launched the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative methods of reducing GHG in the region to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. These states were joined by two additional states and four Canadian provinces and became collectively known as the Western Climate Initiative Partners, though only California and certain Canadian provinces are currently active participants in the Western Climate Initiative. These regional efforts will likely continue based on current trends and concerns related to the reduction of GHG emissions.
​
It is possible that future international, federal, and state initiatives to control GHG emissions could result in increased costs associated with fossil-fuel production and consumption, such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs. Such increased costs for fossil-fuel consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and demand for our products, or those of the operators of our mineral interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, activists may try to hamper fossil-fuel companies by other means, including pressuring financing and other institutions into restricting access to capital, bonding, and insurance, as well as pursuing tort litigation for various alleged climate-related impacts. For more information, see our Risk Factor titled "Our operations are subject to a series of risks resulting from climate change."

​
Water Discharge
​
The Federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate discharges into certain waters, primarily through permitting. Section 404 of the CWA imposes permitting and mitigation requirements associated with the dredging and filling of certain wetlands and streams. The CWA and equivalent state legislation, where such equivalent state legislation exists, affect coal mining operations that impact such wetlands and streams. Although permitting requirements have been tightened in recent years, we believe we have obtained all necessary permits required under CWA Section 404 as it has traditionally been interpreted by the responsible agencies. However, mitigation requirements under existing and possible future "fill" permits may vary considerably. For that reason, the setting of post-mine asset retirement obligation accruals for such mitigation projects is difficult to ascertain with certainty and may increase in the future. For more information about asset retirement obligations, please read "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18 - Asset Retirement Obligations." Although more stringent permitting requirements may be imposed in the future, we are not able to accurately predict the impact, if any, of such permitting requirements.
​
For us or the operators of the properties in which we hold oil & gas mineral interests to conduct certain activities, an operator may need to obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps of Engineers") and/or a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Our coal mining operations typically require Section 404 permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds and stream impoundments. The CWA authorizes the EPA to review Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers, and in 2009, the EPA began reviewing Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers for coal mining in Appalachia. Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits.
​
The EPA also has statutory "veto" power over a Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an "unacceptable adverse effect." In January 2011, the EPA exercised its veto power to withdraw or restrict the use of a previously issued permit for Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine in West Virginia, which is one of the largest surface mining operations ever authorized in Appalachia. This action was the first time that such power was exercised with regard to a previously permitted coal mining project which veto was subsequently upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013. Any future use of the EPA's Section 404 "veto" power could create uncertainly with regard to our continued use of current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our coal revenues. In addition, the EPA initiated a preemptive veto prior to the filing of any actual permit application for a copper and gold mine based on fictitious mine scenario. The implications of this decision could allow the EPA to bypass the state permitting process and engage in watershed and land use planning.
​
Total Maximum Daily Load ("TMDL") regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired waterbody can receive and still meet state water quality standards, and to allocate pollutant loads among the point and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body. Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an antidegradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDL-related allocations or any changes to antidegradation policies for streams near our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production.
​
Considerable legal uncertainty exists surrounding the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the CWA. Rulemakings to establish the extent of such jurisdiction were finalized in 2015 and 2020, respectively, and both rulemakings have been subject to substantial litigation. On August 30, 2021, the US District Court for Arizona granted a request for voluntary remand of the EPA's rule. The Biden Administration has announced plans to establish its own definition of "waters of the United States" ("WOTUS"). Most recently, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers published a proposed rulemaking to revoke the 2020 rule in favor of a pre-2015 definition until a new definition is proposed, which the Biden Administration has announced is underway. Additionally, in January 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on the scope and authority of the CWA and the definition of WOTUS. To the extent any decision expands the scope of the EPA and the Corps of Engineers’ jurisdiction under the CWA, we could face increased costs and delays due to additional permitting and regulatory requirements and possible challenges to permitting decisions.

Hazardous Substances and Wastes
​
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), otherwise known as the "Superfund" law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for the release of hazardous substances may be subject to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and natural resource damages. Some products used in coal mining operations generate waste containing hazardous substances. We are currently unaware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
​
The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and analogous state laws impose requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. Similarly, most wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil & gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, though these wastes typically constitute "solid wastes" that are subject to less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that RCRA could be amended or the EPA or state environmental agencies could adopt policies to require such wastes to become subject to more stringent storage, handling, treatment, or disposal requirements, which could impose significant additional costs on the operators of the properties in which we own oil & gas mineral interests. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous substances. In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material. While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.
​
RCRA impacts the coal industry in particular because it regulates the disposal of certain coal combustion by-products ("CCB"). On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under RCRA for the disposal of CCB. Under the finalized regulations, CCB is regulated as "non-hazardous" waste and avoids the stricter, more costly, regulations under RCRA's "hazardous" waste rules. While the classification of CCB as a hazardous waste would have led to more stringent restrictions and higher costs, this regulation may still increase our customers' operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal. The CCB rule was subject to legal challenge and ultimately remanded to the EPA. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published a final revised rule mandating closure of unlined impoundments, with deadlines to initiate closure between 2021 and 2028, depending on site specific circumstances. Certain provisions of the revised CCB rule were vacated by the D.C. Circuit in 2018. The EPA is expected to finalize additional rules addressing those specific provisions in 2022 and 2023. Meanwhile, on January 25, 2022, the EPA published determinations for 9 of 57 CCB facilities who sought approval to continue disposal of CCB and non-CCB waste streams until 2023, as opposed to the initial 2021 deadline for unlined impoundments prescribed by the current rule. While the EPA issued one conditional approval, the EPA is requiring the remaining facilities to cease receipt of waste within 135 days of completion of public comment, or around July 2022. The current determinations, future determinations of the same nature, or similar actions in expected future rulemakings could lead to accelerated, abrupt, or unplanned suspension of coal-fired boilers. The combined effect of the CCB rules and ELG regulations (discussed below) has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. Such retirements may adversely affect the demand for our coal.
​
On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards ("ELG"), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCB and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal-burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. In November 2019, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2015 ELG rule and announced proposed changes to regulations for the disposal of coal ash in order to reduce compliance costs. In October 2020, EPA published a final rule. In August 2021, EPA initiated supplemental rulemaking indicating that it intended to strengthen certain discharge limits. EPA expects to issue a proposed rule for public comment in fall 2022. It is unclear what impact these regulations will have on the market for our products.
​

Endangered Species Act
​
The federal Endangered Species Act ("ESA") and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the "USFWS") works closely with the OSM and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected from potential impacts from mining-related and oil & gas exploration and production activities. In October 2021, the Biden Administration proposed the rollback of new rules promulgated under the Trump Administration; namely, the USFWS plans to rescind the 2018 rule that revised the process for designating critical habitat for threatened and endangered species under the ESA and second, alongside the National Marine Fisheries Service, the USFWS proposes to rescind the 2020 regulatory definition of "habitat." Final action on these proposed rules will occur in 2022. If the USFWS were to designate species indigenous to the areas in which we operate as threatened or endangered or to redesignate a species from threatened to endangered, we or the operators of the properties in which we hold oil & gas mineral interests could be subject to additional regulatory and permitting requirements, which in turn could increase operating costs or adversely affect our revenues. 
​
Other Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations
​
In addition to the laws and regulations described above, we are subject to regulations regarding underground and above-ground storage tanks in which we may store petroleum or other substances. Some monitoring equipment that we use is subject to licensing under the Federal Atomic Energy Act. Water supply wells located on our properties are subject to federal, state, and local regulations. In addition, our use of explosives is subject to the Federal Safe Explosives Act. We are also required to comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The costs of compliance with these regulations should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
​
Human Capital
​
To conduct our operations, as of December 31, 2021, we employed 2,990 full-time employees, including 2,604 employees involved in active coal mining operations, 219 employees in other operations, and 167 corporate employees. Our workforce is entirely union-free. Our typical employee has approximately eight years of experience with the Partnership and more than 50% of all employees remain employed for more than five years. 
​
To attract and retain the most qualified personnel across all functions of our business we offer competitive compensation packages. In making decisions regarding employee compensation, we review current compensation levels for each position within other companies in the coal industry and other peers and use our discretion to determine an appropriate total compensation package, which generally includes some combination of base salary, possible incentive compensation, medical, dental and life insurance benefits and participation in our profit sharing and savings plan. Depending on the position and employer, incentive compensation bonuses can be based on production and safety goals at a specific coal operation or broader performance goals across the Partnership, among other factors. We intend for each employee's total compensation to be competitive in the marketplace. 
​
Workplace safety is fundamental to our culture. By providing a work environment that rewards safety and encourages employee participation in the safety process, we strive to be the leader in safety performance in the coal mining industry. We are focused on improving employee safety through regular training and continuous monitoring of our progress, including through the mining industry standard of "non-fatal days lost," or "NFDL," which reflects both the frequency and severity of injuries incurred. Our NFDL rating of 3.26 for the year ended December 31, 2021, was below the preliminary industry average over the same time period. In addition, we collected over 13,000 respirable dust samples of the mining environment where our miners regularly work and travel. The average concentration of those samples was 59% below the regulatory standard. We are also regularly inspected by MSHA. For more information about citations or orders for violations of standards under the FMSHA, as amended by the MINER Act, please see our Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
​
We are focused on the health of our employees. In addition to providing medical, dental, and vision insurance with no out-of-pocket premiums for our employees, we also provide on-site medical clinics to provide medical services to our employees and their families. Furthermore, at each of our coal operations and corporate offices, we provide a human resource representative to assist employees with various human resource matters. The Partnership also administers our medical plan, which allows us to control costs and work directly on behalf of our employees with health care providers enabling us in part, to continue providing health benefits with no out-of-pocket premiums for our employees.

26




​
We also have developed steps to enhance protections from, and minimize risks associated with, the spread of COVID-19, as needed. Such steps include or have included, without limitation, staggering shift patterns to promote social distancing, enhanced cleaning procedures, promotion of recommended hygiene practices, limited workplace access, "touch-free" check-in/check-out stations, wellness screening at mine locations, and requiring face coverings where appropriate.
