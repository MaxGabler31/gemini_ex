ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 LogMeIn simplifies how people connect with each other and the world around them to drive meaningful interactions, deepen relationships, and create better outcomes for individuals and businesses. A market leader in unified communications and collaboration, identity and access management, and customer engagement and support solutions, LogMeIn has millions of customers spanning virtually every country across the globe. LogMeIn is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts with additional locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
 We incorporated under the laws of Bermuda as 3am Labs Ltd in February 2003. In August 2004, we completed a domestication in the State of Delaware under the name 3am Labs, Inc. We changed our name to LogMeIn, Inc. in March 2006. Our principal executive offices are located at 320 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Our website address is www.LogMeInInc.com. We have included our website address in this report solely as an inactive textual reference. 
 We introduced our first cloud-based connectivity offering in 2004, which allowed users to securely connect to remote computer resources, including files, applications and the remote device itself. Used primarily by mobile professionals to work remotely and by IT service providers to remotely manage computers and servers, this remote access solution was designed to give users the flexibility to work and interact with their computer resources from any other Internet-connected computer. We have since used this scalable technology to expand the types of devices and data that can be accessed remotely, while introducing a variety of cloud-based offerings or applications designed to address the needs of today’s unified communications and collaboration, identity and access management, customer engagement and support markets. 
 In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of the GoTo family of service offerings, or the GoTo Business, from a wholly–owned subsidiary of Citrix Systems, Inc., or Citrix, via a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which we refer to herein as the Merger. In April 2018, we completed our acquisition of Jive Communications, Inc., or Jive, a provider of cloud-based phone systems and unified communications services.
 We offer both free and fee-based, or premium, subscription software services. Sales of our premium services are generated through online search, word-of-mouth referrals, web-based advertising, off-line advertising, broadcast advertising, public relations, the conversion of free users and expiring free trials to paid subscriptions and direct marketing to new and existing customers. 
 We derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from our customers, who range from individual consumers to small and medium businesses, or SMBs, and to multi-national enterprises. Our revenue is driven primarily by the number and type of our premium services to which our paying customers subscribe. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we generated revenues of $336 million, $990 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. 
 Our Market Opportunity 
 Our cloud-based connectivity services allow our users to work remotely, secure online or cloud-based services, support and manage remote computers and other Internet-enabled devices and collaborate with other users. We believe our services benefit users in the following ways: 

• | Increased productivity both in and outside of traditional office environments. Our cloud-based services have been designed to reduce friction, allowing users to collaborate effectively, simply host and/or attend web-based meetings, replace traditional on-premise PBX phone equipment, access and control remote computers, access and secure cloud or online applications and websites and run applications across different platforms and devices, thereby increasing our users’ mobility, bolstering their security and allowing them to remain productive from virtually anywhere on virtually any Internet-enabled device.

• | Reduced set-up, support and management costs. Our services enable IT staff to administer, monitor and support workers, their applications, their data and their Internet-enabled devices from a remote location. Businesses can easily set-up our cloud-based services with little or no modification to the remote location’s network or security systems and without the need for upfront technology or software investment. Our cloud-based phone services allow customers to efficiently replace older and less secure hardware devices. Additionally, our customers are often able to lower their support and management costs by performing their management-related tasks remotely, thereby reducing or eliminating the costs of on-site support and management. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved security and better adoption of password best practices. Enterprise and business versions of our identity and access management services provide IT staff, line-of-business managers and small business owners with the ability to better protect themselves against the most common online security threats. Our web and desktop password management services can be provisioned for all employees, providing both a productivity benefit to employees who manage numerous passwords for the web and cloud applications needed to do their jobs, while also ensuring that passwords used for these services are securely stored, appropriately complex, unique to each application and changed automatically at regular intervals. Users of our identity and access management services can also further augment these password best practices by enforcing secondary authentication requirements, such as multi-factor authentication, which requires authorization from both a desktop web browser and a mobile application before accessing sensitive applications and data. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased end-user and customer satisfaction. Our customers rely on our services to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of end-user support and customer service. Satisfaction with support and other customer engagement services is primarily measured by customer satisfaction, sales conversions, call-handling times and whether or not an issue is resolved on the first call. Our services enable helpdesk technicians and customer service staff to quickly and easily engage with users, gain access to and take control over a remote user’s Internet-enabled device and, once connected, diagnose and resolve problems while interacting with and possibly training the end user. Our customer engagement services leverage artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology to help customer service and helpdesk technicians engage with their customers across multiple platforms, boosting agent efficiency and effectiveness. Technicians can also answer questions and resolve common dilemmas via web chat, email, SMS and popular social channels, such as Twitter.

• | Higher quality leads, related sales pipeline and conversion rates. Our unified communications and collaboration offerings, as well as other select service cloud offerings are used by inside sales teams, customer service teams and digital marketing teams to generate sales leads, remotely engage prospective buyers, and visually demonstrate products and services in an effort to create sales opportunities, advance sales cycles and boost overall online visit to purchase conversion rates. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strengths 
 We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are key to our success: 
  
• | Large established user community. We have more than two million paying customers and millions of free users worldwide, with products used in virtually every country around the globe. These users drive awareness of our services through personal recommendations, social media and other online communication methods and provide us with a significant audience to which we can market and sell premium services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient customer acquisition model. We believe our free products and our large installed user base help to generate word-of-mouth referrals, which in turn increases the efficiency of our paid marketing activities. Sales of our premium services are generated through word-of-mouth referrals, web-based advertising, online search, off-line advertising, broadcast advertising, the conversion of free users and expiring free trials to paid subscriptions and by marketing to our existing customer and user base. We believe this direct approach to acquiring new customers generates an attractive and predictable return on our sales and marketing expenditures. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Online, cloud-based delivery. Delivering our services online via the cloud allows us to scale and serve additional customers with little incremental expense and to deploy new applications and upgrades quickly and efficiently to our existing customers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | High recurring revenue and high transaction volumes. We sell our premium services on a subscription basis, which provides greater levels of recurring revenues and predictability compared to traditional perpetual license-based business models. We believe that our high volume of new and renewed subscriptions at low transaction prices increases the predictability of our revenues compared to perpetual licensed-based software businesses. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 Our objective is to extend our position as a leading provider of essential cloud-based connectivity services. To accomplish this, we intend to: 
  
• | Acquire new customers. We acquire new customers through word-of-mouth referrals from our existing user community and from paid, online advertising designed to attract visitors to our website. We also encourage our website visitors to try our free services or register for free trials of our premium services. We supplement our online efforts with email and other traditional marketing campaigns and by participating in trade events and web-based seminars. To increase our sales, we plan to continue to aggressively market our solutions and encourage trials of our services while continuing to scale our sales force. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase sales to existing customers. We upsell and cross-sell our broad portfolio of services to our existing premium subscriber customer base. To further penetrate this base, we plan to continue to actively market our portfolio of services through e-commerce and traditional sales. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to expand our service portfolio. We intend to continue to invest in the development of new cloud-based connectivity services for businesses, IT service providers, consumers and mobile professionals. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions. Strategic acquisitions remain a key growth strategy for our business and we believe we have the scale needed to further expand the range of acquisition opportunities we are able to pursue. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy. We also plan to target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of services, as well as add new services to our portfolio. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand internationally. We have more than two million paying customers and millions of free users worldwide, with products used in virtually every country around the globe. We continue to believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our sales internationally. We intend to continue to invest in and expand our international sales and marketing activities to take advantage of this opportunity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to build our user community. We grow our community of users by offering popular free services and through paid advertising that targets prospective customers who are seeking cloud connectivity services. This strategy improves the effectiveness of our online advertising by increasing our response rates when people seeking remote access, collaboration, customer engagement and identity and access management conduct online searches. In addition, our large and growing community of users drives awareness of our services and increases referrals of potential customers and users.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to attract prospective customers to our website, drive use of our free services or enroll them in free trials of our services and convert them to, and retain them as, paying customers. We expend sales and marketing resources through a combination of paid and unpaid sources. We also invest in public relations to broaden the general awareness of our services and to highlight the quality and reliability of our services for specific audiences. We are constantly seeking and employing new methods to reach more users and to convert them to paid subscribers. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we spent $162.8 million, $347.0 million and $383.0 million, respectively, on sales and marketing. 
 New Account Sales. Our sales are often preceded by a trial of one of our services and over 90% of our sales transactions are settled via credit card. Our sales operations team manages the processes, systems and procedures that determine whether or not a trial should be managed by a telephone-based sales representative or handled via our e-commerce sales process. In addition, a small sales and business development team concentrates on sales to larger organizations and the formulation of strategic technology partnerships that are intended to generate additional sales. 
 International Sales. We currently have sales teams located in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, India and Brazil focusing on international sales. In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we generated approximately 29%, 24% and 22%, respectively, of our revenue from customers outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, approximately 29%, 15% and 23% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States. 
 Online Advertising. We advertise online through pay-per-click spending with search engines, banner advertising with online advertising networks and other websites and email newsletters likely to be frequented by our target consumers, SMBs and IT professionals. 
 Tradeshows and Events. We showcase our services at technology and industry-specific tradeshows and events. Our participation in these shows ranges from elaborate presentations in front of large groups to one-on-one discussions and demonstrations at manned booths. 
 Offline Advertising. Our offline print advertising is comprised of publications targeted at IT professionals and consumers. We also sponsor advertorials in regional publications, which target IT consumers. Additionally, from time-to-time we have advertised using more traditional methods, such as outdoor advertising, in regional markets. 
 Radio Advertising. Our radio advertising includes 30-second “spots” as well as radio program sponsorships, and is primarily conducted on satellite and Internet radio networks, with some select advertising on traditional FM and AM radio stations. Show, channel and program selection is based on our key target audiences, most notably IT professionals and knowledge workers. 
 Word-of-Mouth Referrals. We believe that we have developed a loyal customer and user base, and new customers frequently claim to have heard about us from a current LogMeIn user. Many of our users arrive at our website via word-of-mouth referrals from existing users of our services. 
 Direct Advertising Into Our User Community. We have a large existing user community comprised of both free users and paying customers. Users of most of our services come to our website each time they log in to their account and we use this opportunity to promote additional premium services to them. 
 Social Media Marketing. We participate in online communities and social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube for the purpose of marketing, public relations and customer service. Through these online collaboration sites, we actively engage our users, learn about their needs, and foster word-of-mouth by creating and responding to content about LogMeIn events, promotions, product news and user questions. 
 Web-Based Seminars. We offer free online seminars to current and prospective customers designed to educate them about the benefits of online collaboration, remote access, support and administration, particularly with LogMeIn, and guide them in the use of our services.

 Public Relations. We engage in targeted public relations programs, including issuing press releases announcing important company events and product releases, participating in interviews with reporters and analysts, both general and industry specific, and by attending panel and group discussions and speeches at industry events.

Our Infrastructure, Technology and Developments 
 LogMeIn Service Delivery Platform. We introduced our first cloud-based connectivity offering in 2004 which was built on our proprietary “Gravity” connectivity platform. This technology enabled users to securely connect to remote computer resources, thus affording them the flexibility to work and interact with their remote devices from virtually any other Internet-connected computer.
 Today, we have leveraged our proprietary technology and years of connectivity experience to develop modern cloud-based hosting platforms which are capable of delivering a variety of service offerings designed to meet the needs of today’s unified communications and collaboration, identity and access management and customer engagement and support markets. Our services are hosted both in the cloud and in geographically diverse third party co-location facilities located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, India and Australia. Our cloud connectivity platforms are designed to reduce the bandwidth and other infrastructure requirements needed to establish secure connections over the Internet between remote computers and other Internet-enabled devices and manage the direct transmission of data between remotely connected devices, thereby making our services faster and less expensive to deliver than other competing services. 
 Research and Development. We have made and intend to continue making significant investments in research and development in order to continue to improve the efficiency of our service delivery platform, improve our existing services and bring new services to market. Our primary engineering organizations are in Hungary, Germany, India, Canada and the United States. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 33% of our employees worked in research and development. 
 Intellectual Property. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent and other intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality policies and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consisted of over 170 issued patents with approximately 30 patent applications pending. 
 We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners, and through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop products or services with the same functionality as our services. In addition, U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. If granted, our patents may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the exact effect of our pending patents, if issued, and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 Although the protection afforded by copyright, trade secret and trademark law, written agreements and common law may provide some advantages, we believe that the following factors help us maintain a competitive advantage: 
  
• | our large user and customer base;
--+----------------------------------


• | the technological skills of our research and development personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | frequent enhancements to our services; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | continued expansion of our proprietary technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 “LogMeIn” is a registered trademark in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and the European Union. We also hold a number of other trademarks and service marks identifying certain of our services and features of our services. We also have a number of trademark applications pending.

Competition 
 The markets in which we compete are constantly evolving and we expect to face additional competition in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors in these markets include: 

• | service reliability and security;
--+----------------------------------


• | ease of initial setup and use;
--+-------------------------------


• | fitness for use and the design of features that best meet the needs of the target customer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to support multiple device types and operating systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cost of customer acquisition;
--+------------------------------


• | product and brand awareness;
--+-----------------------------


• | the ability to reach large fragmented groups of users;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | cost of service delivery; and
--+------------------------------


• | pricing flexibility.
--+---------------------

 We believe that our large user base, efficient customer acquisition model and low service delivery costs enable us to compete effectively against services offered by some of our largest competitors, which include Adobe Connect, Amazon, Cisco Systems’ WebEx division, Google and Microsoft Skype. Our audio services also compete with solutions from 8x8, AT&T, BT, Intercall, PGi, RingCentral, Verizon and Vonage. Certain of our services also compete with current or potential services offered by companies like AgileBits, Apple, BlueJeans Networks, Dashlane, GFI, IBM, KeePass, LivePerson, OKTA, Oracle, Splashtop, TeamViewer and Zoom Video Communications. 
 Many of our actual and potential competitors enjoy greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied products and services and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, than we do. In addition, we may also face future competition from new market entrants. However, we believe that our large user base, efficient customer acquisition model and relatively low costs of service delivery position us well to compete effectively now and in the future.
