History and Development of the Company
On July 12, 2016, IHS Inc. (“IHS”), a Delaware corporation, Markit Ltd. (“Markit”), a Bermuda exempted company, and Marvel Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of Markit, completed a merger (“Merger”) pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into IHS, with IHS surviving the Merger as an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of Markit. Upon completion of the Merger, Markit became the combined group holding company and was renamed IHS Markit Ltd. (“IHS Markit” or “we” or “us” or “our”). In accordance with the terms of the Merger agreement, IHS stockholders received 3.5566 common shares of IHS Markit for each share of IHS common stock they owned. IHS was treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, which is reflected in the results of operations, financial position, financial statements, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other sections of this report refer to legacy Markit and legacy IHS, as the context requires, for each of the entities prior to the Merger, and to IHS Markit, the combined company after completion of the Merger.
IHS was in business since 1959 and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005. Markit was founded in 2003 and was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda in 2014 to become the holding company for Markit’s business in connection with its initial public offering on the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) in June 2014. IHS Markit’s common shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “INFO.”

Our Vision
Our vision is to be our customers’ leading source for critical information, analytics, and insight. Our purpose is to help our customers grow, enabling better decision making and operational efficiency.
Our Business
We deliver data, insight, and software that combine our expertise, unique content sets, and leading technology to the world’s major industries, financial markets, and governments. Our analytics reveal interdependencies across complex industries, which enhances transparency, reduces risk, and improves operational efficiency for our customers. Our information, analytics, and solutions are significant components in the systems and workflows of many of our customers and continue to become increasingly important to our customers’ operations. We leverage leading technologies and our industry expertise to create innovative products and services that provide information and insight to our customers to help them be more efficient and make more informed decisions. We are committed to sustainable, profitable growth.
Our core competency is using our expertise to source and transform data into information and analytics that our customers can use when making operational and strategic decisions. We are a dependable resource for our customers, who require and demand the most accurate and robust information available. We are dedicated to providing the information and analysis our customers need to make critical decisions that drive growth and value for their operations.
By integrating and connecting our information and analytics with proprietary and widely used decision-support technology on scalable platforms, we produce critical information and insight designed to meet our customers’ needs. Our product development teams have also created proprietary Web services and application interfaces that enhance access to our information and allow our customers to integrate our offerings with other data, business processes, and applications (such as computer-aided design, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), supply chain management, and product data/lifecycle management).
Our Objectives
To achieve our vision, we are focusing our efforts primarily on the following areas: 


• | Customers. We are working together with our customers to be a trusted and valued partner through meaningful and responsive engagement, deep and differentiated expertise, and best-in-class delivery.

 5


• | Product. We strive to develop innovative, best-in-class products that deliver real value, are reliable, and stand out from our competitors.


• | Technology and data science. We are using technology and data science as a differentiator to maximize and optimize our content, expertise, and operations.


• | People. Our work environment is designed to encourage excitement and pride in the work we do and where our people are constantly learning and feel challenged, respected, and valued.


• | Efficiency. We expect to achieve operational excellence by consistently improving productivity and efficiency by leveraging technology and operations.


• | Financial strength. We seek to consistently deliver on our key financial commitments.

We benchmark our progress annually against these objectives using external and internal metrics. For example, to measure customer and employee satisfaction, we use third-party surveys and develop goals based on those metrics.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to bring together information, research, analytics, and technology to deliver integrated offerings to customers in separate but interconnected industries. We believe that we can best implement our strategy by using our strong foundation of leading assets, talent, and competitive positioning in large growing global markets to achieve the following:

• | Increase in geographic, product, and customer penetration. We believe there are continued opportunities to add new customers and to increase the use of our products and services by existing customers. We plan to add new customers and build our relationships with existing customers by leveraging our existing sales channels, broad product portfolio, global footprint, and industry expertise to anticipate and respond to the changing demands of our end markets.


• | Introduce innovative offerings and enhancements. To maintain and enhance our position as a leading information services provider, we introduce enhancements to our products and services, as well as launch new products and services. We maintain an active dialogue with our customers and partners to allow us to understand their needs and anticipate market developments. We also seek to develop innovative uses for our existing products and services to generate incremental revenue, find more cost-effective inputs to support our existing products and services, and facilitate development of profitable new products and services. Our investment priorities are primarily in energy, automotive, and financial services, and we intend to continue to invest across our business to increase our customer value proposition.


• | Balance capital allocation. We expect to balance capital allocation between returning capital to shareholders (through consistent share repurchases) and completing mergers and acquisitions, focused primarily on targeted transactions in our core end markets that will allow us to continue to build out our strategic position.

Our Global Organizational Structure
To serve our customers, we are organized into the following four industry-focused segments:
•Resources, which includes our Energy and Chemicals product offerings; 

• | Transportation, which includes our Automotive; Maritime & Trade; and Aerospace, Defense & Security product offerings;


• | Consolidated Markets & Solutions, which includes our Product Design; Technology, Media & Telecom; and Economics & Country Risk product offerings; and


• | Financial Services, which includes our financial Information, Processing, and Solutions product offerings, as well as product offerings of Ipreo, our recent acquisition.

We believe that this sales and operating model helps our customers do business with us by providing a cohesive, consistent, and effective product, sales, and marketing approach by segment.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

• | Trusted partner with diversified, global customer base and strong brand recognition. We believe that our customers trust and rely on us for our consultative approach to product development, dedication to customer satisfaction, and ability to execute and deliver effective product and service offerings. Our industry expertise allows us to effectively

 6

anticipate, understand, and address our customers’ needs. The Merger increased our capacity to address new markets and opportunities, and our global footprint allows us to serve our customers throughout the world and to introduce our products and services to customers in new markets. Our product offerings are well established and recognized in multiple industries. We also own a number of well-known brands, including CARFAX, CERAWeek, Jane’s, the Purchasing Managers Index series, Bigdough, and the iBoxx indices.

• | Breadth and depth of information and analytics. Our customers benefit from a concentration of intellectual wealth and thought leadership in a variety of industries. We believe that our global team of information and industry experts, research analysts, and economists provides our customers with leading strategic information and research. We convert raw data into critical information through a series of transformational steps that reduce the uncertainty that is inherent in unrefined data. Our goal is to ensure that the information we provide through our product offerings is correct, current, complete, and consistent; therefore, we place a high degree of emphasis on the data transformation process. With our process, we believe that we are able to provide information and analytics that are both useful to our customers and available where and when needed. Our process also provides the foundation for the integration of our products and services into differentiated offerings and advanced analytics for the customers in our target industries. 


• | Attractive financial model. We believe we have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue, margin expansion, cash generation, and capital flexibility characteristics.


◦ | Significant recurring revenue. We offer our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee agreements, and this business model has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. For the year ended November 30, 2018, we generated approximately 84 percent of our revenue from recurring revenue streams. Many of our offerings are core to our customers’ business operations, and we have long-term relationships with many of our customers.


◦ | Solid margin expansion. Our customer focus and fiscal discipline has permitted us to maintain and progressively increase our margins as we integrate and streamline our operations and leverage our business model to provide valuable customer support.


◦ | High cash generation. Our business has low capital requirements for product enhancement and new product development, allowing us to generate strong cash flow.


◦ | Capital flexibility. Our cash flow model and credit quality provide us with a significant amount of flexibility in decision-making, allowing us to balance internal resource and investment needs, acquisitions, and shareholder return.

Our Customers
We have a diverse customer base, with more than 50,000 business and government customers, including 80 percent of the Fortune Global 500 and 70 percent of the Fortune U.S. 1000. Our customers operate in global interconnected industries and financial markets, and we continue to build on our existing scale to integrate our comprehensive content, expertise, tools, technology, and research and analysis to produce a differentiated offering that makes us an important part of many of our customers’ core workflows. In 2018, no customer or group of affiliated customers represented more than 10 percent of our revenue.
Our Operating Segments
We develop our products and services based on customer needs in the target industries we serve and in the workflows that our customers use. We have organized our business to address the following key industries:
Resources
Our Resources segment includes our Energy offerings, which represent approximately 87 percent of Resources revenue, and our Chemicals offerings, which make up the balance of the segment’s revenue.
Our Energy offerings are focused on upstream, midstream, downstream, and power/gas/coal/renewables (“PGCR”) services. Within those offerings, we also offer proprietary physical commodity pricing through our OPIS Price Reporting Agency Group.

 7

and 6,200 marine vessels, and a database of 47,000 merger and acquisition transactions. We do this through a combination of energy technical information, analytical tools, and market forecasting and consulting. For instance, strategic planners, geoscientists, and engineers use our insight and leading geotechnical database and analytical tools to facilitate exploration, development, and production of energy assets. Some of our key offerings include the following:

We are also a leading supplier of bespoke consulting, providing strategic direction and capital investment advisory services. A key pricing product offering for our midstream and downstream offerings is the OPIS Spot Ticker, which allows almost a thousand petroleum wholesalers in North America to time their rack purchases in order to reduce expenditures on their fuel purchases.

Our Chemicals offerings include data for manufacturing processes, as well as capital expenditure, cost, price, production, trade, demand, and capacity industry analysis and forecasts for more than 250 chemicals in more than 110 countries. We also have an extensive library of detailed techno-economic analyses of chemicals and refining process technologies. We provide a number of consulting services, including training, strategy development, and project development offerings to the chemical and related industries. Our business information services track current events, supply high-velocity information, and hold conferences related to the chemical industry. Our chemical data, insights, and analysis help companies develop and deploy robust plans pertaining to capital deployment, operations, and risk mitigation.
In addition, we leverage our market leadership in these industries to convene global industry, government, and regulatory leaders in global and regional events, such as our annual CERAWeek and World Petrochemical conferences.

In the US, 
 8

our sales and marketing offerings draw on a database of more than 7 billion ownership records, covering 760 million vehicles and more than 240 million US households over a period of 25 years. We also offer a range of vehicle recall solutions to carmakers, including identifying households to be contacted, providing accurate measurement of recall program completion, and in some cases, providing a full turnkey solution that manages the entire fulfillment process for their safety recall campaigns. 
Our automotiveMastermind (“aM”) offering provides predictive analytics and marketing automation software for the new car dealer market, enabling dealers to improve their customer retention and extend their customer portfolio through “conquest” campaigns.
Within the used car market, we support dealers, insurers, and consumers through our CARFAX products. These offerings provide critical information for used car dealers and their customers in the used car buying process. For example, CARFAX vehicle history reports provide maintenance, accident, odometer, and commercial use information on cars in the United States. This history, based on more than 20 billion records collected from more than 112,000 data sources, provides confidence to dealers and consumers in the car buying process. We have expanded our product line under CARFAX to include a used car listing service for dealers and vehicle-specific valuation offerings.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are located throughout the world and are organized within their respective business lines to align with our customers. In addition to field experience, we also conduct regular customer surveys to understand both current customer satisfaction levels and potential opportunities for product and coverage improvement.
Our financial services and corporate account management teams are part of our overall sales organization and are responsible for the delivery of the full breadth of our products and services to new and existing customers. The account management teams are also responsible for our overall relationship with our larger customers, focusing on developing new business, increasing our sales pipeline, and developing strategic transactions.
Our marketing organization is aligned with our sales organization, and defines our marketing strategy and executes marketing programs. A primary focus for marketing strategy is to empower IHS Markit brand awareness, revenue acceleration, and market leadership across our key industries for all products and services globally. Functionally, this includes corporate marketing, product marketing, and field marketing.
Competition
We believe the principal competitive factors in our business include the following:

• | Depth, breadth, timeliness, and accuracy of information and data provided

•Quality of decision-support tools and services
 11

•Quality and relevance of our analysis and insight
•Ease of use
•Customer support
•Value for price

We believe that we compete favorably on each of these factors. Although we face competition in specific industries and with respect to specific offerings, we do not believe that we have a direct competitor across all of the industries we serve due to the depth and breadth of our offerings. Competitors within specific industries or with respect to specific offerings are described below.

• | Resources. Our Energy and Chemical offerings compete primarily with offerings from Verisk, DrillingInfo, Schlumberger, Halliburton, GeoScout, Reed Elsevier, Argus, Genscape, S&P Global, and Nexant.


• | Transportation. In the Automotive market, we primarily compete with offerings from LMC Automotive, Urban Science, and Experian and, with respect to vehicle history reports, principally with Experian and various other providers approved by the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System of the United States Department of Justice. In Maritime & Trade markets, we primarily compete with offerings from Informa and Genscape, and increasingly Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. In AD&S markets, we primarily compete with offerings from Avascent in the area of market forecasts, Palantir and IBM Cognitive in the area of deep analytics, and Accenture in procurement and system sustainability.

Government Contracts
We sell our products to various government agencies and entities. No individual contract is significant to our business. Although some of our government contracts are subject to terms that would allow renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the government, we believe that no renegotiation or termination of any individual contract or subcontract at the election of the government would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Intellectual Property
We rely heavily on intellectual property, including the intellectual property we own and license. We regard our trademarks, copyrights, licenses, and other intellectual property as valuable assets and use intellectual property laws, as well as license and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, channel and strategic partners, and others, to protect our rights. In addition, we exercise reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights and enforce these rights when we become aware of any potential or actual violation or misuse.
We use intellectual property licensed from third parties, including SDOs, government agencies, public sources, market data providers, financial institutions, and manufacturers, as a component of our offerings and, in many cases, it cannot be independently replaced or recreated by us or others. We have longstanding relationships with most of the third parties from whom we license information. Almost all of the licenses that we rely upon are nonexclusive and expire within one to two years, unless renewed, although we have longer licenses with some of those third parties, particularly in the Financial Services segment.
We maintain registered trademarks and service marks in jurisdictions around the world. In addition, we have obtained patents and applied for patents in the United States, primarily related to our software portfolio, including our Kingdom, 
 12

Goldfire, Indices, and Digital products. For more information relating to our intellectual property rights, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information.”
Employees
As of November 30, 2018, we had approximately 14,900 employees located in 35 countries around the world.
Seasonality
Our business has seasonal aspects. Our first quarter generally has our lowest quarterly levels of revenue and profit. We also experience event-driven seasonality in our business; for instance, CERAWeek, an annual energy conference, is typically held in the second quarter of each year. Another example is the biennial release of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (“BPVC”) engineering standard, which generates revenue for us predominantly in the third quarter of every other year. The most recent BPVC release was in the third quarter of 2017.
