     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
     General 
        The Container Store® is the original and leading specialty retailer of storage and organization products and solutions in the United States and the only national retailer solely devoted to the category. We provide a collection of creative, multifunctional and customizable storage and organization solutions that are sold in our stores and online through a high-service, differentiated shopping experience. Our vision is to be a beloved brand and the first choice for customized organization solutions and services. Our customers are highly educated, very busy and primarily homeowners with a higher than average household income. We service them with storage and organization solutions that help them accomplish projects, maximize their space, and make the most of their home. We believe an organized life is a happy life. 
         We were founded in 1978 in Dallas, Texas as The Container Store, Inc. In 2007, The Container Store, Inc. was sold to The Container Store Group, Inc. In November 2013, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the "IPO"). Our common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "TCS." In fiscal 2017, we generated net sales of $857.2 million. Today our operations consist of two operating segments:
 

The Container Store ("TCS"), which consists of our retail stores,
website and call center, as well as our installation and organizational services business. We operate 90 stores with an average size of approximately 25,000 square feet (19,000 selling square feet) in
32 states and the District of Columbia. Our stores present our products in a unique and engaging atmosphere. Our visual merchandising team works to ensure that all of our merchandise is appropriately
showcased to show solutions to accomplish our customer's projects, highlighting the value and functionality of our products, and to maximize the appeal of our image and brand. We maintain a relatively
consistent store layout which creates a familiar shopping experience across our store base. Our stores are clean and spacious with orderly merchandising and strategic product placements to optimize
our selling space and increase productivity. We allow our customers to shop with us in a variety of waysanywhere, anytime, any way they want through a multi-channel shopping experience.
Our stores receive substantially all of our products directly from our distribution center co-located with our corporate headquarters and call center in Coppell, Texas. In fiscal 2017, TCS had net
sales of $787.4 million, which represented approximately 92% of our total net sales. 
Elfa, The Container Store, Inc.'s wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Elfa International AB
("Elfa"), which designs and manufactures component-based shelving and drawer systems and made-to-measure sliding doors. Elfa was founded in 1948 and is headquartered in Malmö, Sweden.
Elfa's shelving and drawer systems are customizable for any area of the home, including closets, kitchens, offices and garages. Elfa operates three manufacturing facilities with two located in Sweden
and one in Poland. The Container Store began selling elfa® products in 1978 and acquired Elfa in 1999. Today our TCS segment is the exclusive distributor of elfa® products in
the U.S. and represented approximately 44% of Elfa's total sales in fiscal 2017. Elfa also sells its products on a wholesale basis to various retailers in approximately 30 countries around the world,
with a concentration in the Nordic region of Europe. In fiscal 2017, the Elfa segment had $69.9 million of third party net sales, which represented approximately 8% of our total net sales.

     Our Key Differentiators 
  Our Unique Product CollectionAccomplishing Projects in Every Area of the Home:
        Our merchandising philosophy is to provide a carefully curated, one of a kind collection of storage and organization solutions for every area of the home, at a variety of price points. We offer approximately 10,000 products designed to accomplish projects and save space and time. Each year, we introduce over 2,000 new SKUs. Our solutions-based selling approach (versus items-based) is delivered by our highly trained salespeople. We believe helping customers accomplish their organizational projects by selling solutions primarily consisting of exclusive, proprietary products differentiates us from other retailers. In fact, over half of our annual sales come from exclusive or proprietary products. 
         Currently, our stores are typically organized into 15 distinct lifestyle departments. The types of products sold in each department are as follows:

           In order to offer our unique collection of products and to execute a competitive merchandising and business strategy, we work to form meaningful, long-lasting relationships with vendors from around the world. We believe these relationships benefit us in a number of ways, including providing us with an increased number of exclusive products and competitive pricing. We believe that by creatively crafting mutually beneficial vendor relationships we foster a unique sense of loyalty among our more than 800 product vendors. Seventeen of our top 20 vendors have been with us for at least 10 years and several of those vendors have been with us since our inception in 1978. For the TCS segment, our top 10 vendors, excluding Elfa, accounted for 30% of our total purchases in fiscal 2017. In order to maximize our purchasing flexibility, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our vendors. 
   Custom Closets:
        We continue to believe that our focus on Custom Closets, inclusive of elfa® product solutions, TCS Closets®, closet completion products, and installation services provides a unique opportunity to drive comparable store sales through higher average ticket while differentiating the Company from online, items-based retailers. Our highly-trained and experienced sales force has been selling proprietary, custom-designed elfa® and other closet solutions for almost 40 years. We believe there is no other comparable retailer executing this holistic approach to custom closets. We offer the complete custom closet solutionnot just the framework of the closet, but the full array of closet organization products that accompany the closet, as well as a national footprint with millions of customers coming through the door and visiting our online site each year. We design and sell Custom Closets in-store, online, through our call center, as well as through our Contained Home® in-home organization service. 
         Our elfa® products continue to be an ever important, highly profitable and differentiating component in the growth of our company and our commitment to dominating the custom closet market, accounting for about 25% of our TCS retail sales. Due to our vertical integration with Elfa, we have control over the sourcing and availability of elfa®, our best selling and highest margin product. We are the exclusive distributor of elfa® products in the United States. Approximately 20% of our fiscal 2017 TCS segment purchases were attributed to intercompany purchases from our Elfa segment. 
   Our Shopping Experience:
        We strive to create an Air of Excitement® in each of our stores across the country. We say, "three steps in the door and you can tell whether or not a store has it." You can experience the Air of Excitement® through our employees' smiling faces and their genuine interest in a customer's organizational projects; in the bright visual displays of products and solutions; in our clean, well-organized store; and in our energetic product demonstrations and upbeat music. 
         This is coupled with our highly personalized approach to customer service. Our employees are trained to ask questions to understand our customers' needs. We believe that if we fail to discover the underlying storage and organization challenges of our customers, we fail to truly help them and make them happy. Service and selling are the same thing at The Container Store. We believe we can best serve our customers by astonishing them and giving them the solutions they truly need to accomplish their organizational projects. 
         We are a multi-channel retailer, with a fully-integrated website, responsive mobile site, and call center to complement our physical stores. Our website, containerstore.com, is intended to replicate the store experience offering the same product assortment and providing real time inventory information for our stores, as well as certain products found exclusively online. We enhance the customer's experience and deepen loyalty by creating consistent, relevant messages, regardless of which channel is being usedwe are channel agnostic. We offer free shipping on orders over $75 and our customers are able to purchase online and pick up at a store, with curbside pick-up in most markets, or request 
 7

   same-day home delivery in select markets. The website, mobile site, and call center sales channels accounted for an aggregate of approximately 17% of TCS net sales in fiscal 2017. 
   Our Stores:
        We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and nationally recognized brand name to successfully develop new stores in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new, existing, small and large markets. Our current footprint of 90 stores extends to 32 states and the District of Columbia. We opened a total of five new stores (including one relocation) in the 2017 fiscal year and we expect to open a total of four new stores (including two relocations) in the 2018 fiscal year. While our current expansion focus is on domestic markets, we believe international expansion may provide additional growth opportunities for us in the future. 
         We have a strong base of profitable stores and believe that our expansion opportunities in the United States are significant. We plan to continue to seek out strategic and profitable real estate expansion via a variety of store formats and sizes. In fiscal 2017, we opened a reduced-sized footprint store in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and three of the anticipated four new stores in fiscal 2018 are being designed as reduced-sized footprint stores as well. We also began a complete re-design of our flagship store in Dallas, which we believe will provide us insight to develop new store formats and evolve the future of our existing stores' experience. Our store opening strategy involves a strategic formula of training, marketing, non-profit partnerships and public relations, which enables our new stores to deliver strong sales volume more quickly. 
   Our Employees and Culture:
        The Container Store has been getting people organized for almost 40 years, and since 1978, we've also been running our business guided by our values-based set of principles. We're proud to be one of the founding companies in a movement called Conscious Capitalism®, which includes a group of like-minded businesses, thought leaders, authors and academics all working together to change the way business is done in America and around the world. We have a firm belief that creating value for and optimizing relationships between all of the stakeholders of our businessemployees, customers, vendors, community and shareholdersis the right thing to do. 
         Consistent with our commitment to Conscious Capitalism, we believe that happy employees lead directly to better performance and higher profits. We believe in putting employees first and staying true to our seven Foundation Principles®simple business philosophies that guide each decision we make. One of those Foundation Principles is 1 Great Person = 3 Good People® in terms of business productivitythat's our hiring philosophy. In fact, in fiscal 2017, we hired only 6% of job applicants. Our employee-first culture includes a tremendous commitment to communication, training and career development that helps deliver a differentiated experience to our customers, which we believe results in a higher average ticket, repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential customers. We provide extensive formal training to full-time store employees, especially during their first year of employment. Our stores offer flexible work schedules, comprehensive benefits and above retail industry average compensation to both full-time and part-time employees. As a result, our full-time employee voluntary turnover rate was approximately 15% on average over the past two years, significantly below the retail average. It's for these reasons and more that The Container Store has been named by FORTUNE Magazine to its annual list of 100 Best Companies to Work For® 19 years in a row. 
         As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,950 employees, of which approximately 4,400 were TCS employees and approximately 550 were Elfa employees. Of the 4,400 TCS employees, approximately 2,900 were part-time employees.

      Distribution 
        In the TCS segment, substantially all of our merchandise flows through a centralized distribution center prior to transport to our retail stores. Our distribution center is co-located with our corporate offices in Coppell, Texas. The approximately 1.1 million square foot facility was designed and constructed specifically for The Container Store and is comprised of approximately 93,000 square feet of corporate office space and approximately 1 million square feet of warehouse space. 
         Our Coppell, Texas distribution center is utilized for retail store replenishment and direct-to-customer orders. With the exception of the Dallas / Fort Worth market, we utilize third party truckload carriers to transport all of our products to our stores. We utilize best in class logistics technology to optimize operations and current processes for picking, packing and shipping while providing a strong foundation for future growth. We continue to strengthen our distribution center with ongoing process and material handling improvements, as well as automation, in order to achieve even greater efficiencies in service levels and the management of our inventory. 
         Within our distribution operations, we have a culture of safety and efficiency, with a robust metric program and a commitment to continuous improvement. All processes, teams and individuals are held to high efficiency and performance standards. We believe that the size and scalability of the distribution center is sufficient to support our future expansion over the next 2 to 3 years. However, as we continually assess our distribution and supply chain operations to ensure we are operating the most efficient and cost-effective distribution network, we believe that opening a second distribution center will significantly improve service levels to our customers while at the same time reduce our supply chain and distribution costs. We are currently in the process of opening a second distribution center in the northeastern United States, which is expected to be operating in late fiscal 2019. We also continue to invest in supply chain system enhancements for increased logistics network support. 
         Elfa utilizes a broad network of third-party carriers to deliver products from its manufacturing facilities to customers worldwide. 
      Intellectual property 
        Our "The Container Store," "Contain Yourself", "Foundation Principles", "POP! Perfectly Organized Perks", "TCS Closets", "Contained Home", and "elfa" trademarks and certain variations thereon, such as our "The Container Store" logo and many trademarks used for our product lines and sales campaigns are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own many domain names, including "www.containerstore.com," "www.whatwestandfor.com" and others that include our trademarks. We own several elfa® utility and design patents protecting Elfa's closet and shelving systems, and a utility patent for TCS's proprietary retail shopping computer systems, along with copyrights in our catalogs, websites, and other marketing material. We believe that our trademarks, product designs and copyrighted works have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement. 
      Competition 
        We operate within the storage and organization category which extends across many retail segments including housewares, office supplies and travel, among others. However, we are the only national retailer solely devoted to it. Storage and organization products are sold by a variety of retailers, including mass merchants, specialty retail chains, and internet-based retailers, but they devote 
 9

   a smaller portion of their merchandise assortment to storage and organization. Some of these retailers are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than The Container Store. We compete with such retailers based on our customer service, product selection and quality, price, convenience, effective consumer marketing and promotional activities, the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences, vendor relationships, and brand recognition, among other things. We believe that the strength of our solutions-based selling with highly trained employees, exclusive offerings and vendor relationships, our passionate and loyal customer base and the quality, differentiation and breadth of product assortment compare favorably to those of our competitors. 
      Seasonality 
        Our storage and organization product offering makes us less susceptible to holiday season shopping patterns than many retailers. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of net sales, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter, attributable primarily to the impact of Our Annual elfa® Sale, which traditionally starts on or about December 24th and runs into February. As such, our business has historically realized greater leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses during our fiscal fourth quarter. In fact, over half of our adjusted net income was derived in the fiscal fourth quarter in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015. For more information regarding our use of adjusted net income, and a reconciliation of adjusted net income to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) available to common shareholders, see "Item 6: Selected Financial and Operating Data." 
      Regulation and legislation 
        We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 
         We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.
