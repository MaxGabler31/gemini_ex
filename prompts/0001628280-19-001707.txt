Item 1. Business.
Overview
Noble Corporation plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“Noble-UK”), is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry. We provide contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry with our global fleet of mobile offshore drilling units. We focus on a balanced, high-specification fleet of floating and jackup rigs and the deployment of our drilling rigs in oil and gas basins around the world. Noble and its predecessors have been engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells since 1921.
We report our contract drilling operations as a single reportable segment, Contract Drilling Services, which reflects how we manage our business. The mobile offshore drilling units comprising our offshore rig fleet operate in a global market for contract drilling services and are often redeployed to different regions due to changing demands of our customers, which consist primarily of large, integrated, independent and government-owned or controlled oil and gas companies throughout the world. As of February 19, 2019, our fleet of 24 drilling rigs consisted of eight drillships, four semisubmersibles and 12 jackups. On February 14, 2019, we exercised an option to purchase an additional jackup and expect to complete the purchase in late February 2019.
Noble Corporation, a Cayman Islands company (“Noble-Cayman”), is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Noble-UK, our publicly-traded parent company. Noble-UK’s principal asset is all of the shares of Noble-Cayman. Noble-Cayman has no public equity outstanding. The consolidated financial statements of Noble-UK include the accounts of Noble-Cayman, and Noble-UK conducts substantially all its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries.
On August 1, 2014, Noble-UK completed the separation and spin-off of a majority of its standard specification offshore drilling business (the “Spin-off”) through a pro rata distribution of all the ordinary shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Paragon Offshore plc (“Paragon Offshore”), to the holders of Noble’s ordinary shares. The results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to the Spin-off date and incremental Spin-off related costs have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding the Spin-off and certain matters relating to Paragon Offshore, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Executive Overview— Spin-off of Paragon Offshore plc” and Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15— Commitments and Contingencies.”
Drilling Services
We typically provide contract drilling services under an individual contract, on a dayrate basis. Although the final terms of the contracts result from negotiations with our customers, many contracts are awarded based upon a competitive bidding process. Our drilling contracts generally contain the following terms:

• | contract duration extending over a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill a defined number wells;


• | payment of compensation to us (generally in U.S. Dollars although some customers, typically national oil companies, require a part of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a “daywork” basis, so that we receive a fixed amount for each day (“dayrate”) that the drilling unit is operating under contract (a lower rate or no compensation is payable during periods of equipment breakdown and repair or adverse weather or in the event operations are interrupted by other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control);


• | provisions permitting early termination of the contract by the customer (i) if the unit is lost or destroyed or (ii) if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of equipment or breach of contract;


• | provisions allowing the impacted party to terminate the contract if specified “force majeure” events beyond the contracting parties’ control occur for a defined period of time;


• | payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling unit, including labor costs and the cost of incidental supplies;


• | provisions that allow us to recover certain cost increases from our customers in certain long-term contracts; and


• | provisions that require us to lower dayrates for documented cost decreases in certain long-term contracts.

The terms of some of our drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts and, in certain cases, without any payment.
Generally, our contracts allow us to recover our mobilization and demobilization costs associated with moving a drilling unit from one regional location to another. When market conditions require us to assume these costs, our operating margins are reduced accordingly. For shorter moves, such as “field moves,” our customers have generally agreed to assume the costs of moving the unit in the form of a reduced dayrate or “move rate” while the unit is being moved. Under current market conditions, we are much less likely to receive full reimbursement of our mobilization and demobilization costs.
4

During periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or repudiate their contracts with us although we seek to enforce our rights under our contracts. The renegotiations may include changes to key contract terms, such as pricing, termination and risk allocation. 
For a discussion of our backlog of commitments for contract drilling services, please read Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Contract Drilling Services Backlog.”
Drilling Fleet
Noble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas sector. Noble owns and operates one of the most modern, versatile and technically advanced fleets of mobile offshore drilling units in the offshore drilling industry. Noble provides, through its subsidiaries, contract drilling services with a fleet of 24 offshore drilling units, consisting of eight drillships, four semisubmersibles and 12 jackups, focused largely on ultra-deepwater and high-specification drilling opportunities in both established and emerging regions worldwide. Each type of drilling rig is described further below. Several factors determine the type of unit most suitable for a particular job, the most significant of which include the water depth and the environment of the intended drilling location, whether the drilling is being done over a platform or other structure, and the intended well depth. At December 31, 2018, our fleet was located in Canada, Far East Asia, the Middle East, the North Sea, Oceania, the Black Sea, South America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Drillships
A drillship is a type of floating drilling unit that is based on the ship-based hull of the vessel and equipped with modern drilling equipment that gives it the capability of easily transitioning from various worldwide locations and carrying high capacities of equipment while being able to drill ultra-deepwater oil and gas wells in up to 12,000 feet of water. Drillships can stay directly over the drilling location without anchors in open seas using a dynamic positioning system (“DPS”), which coordinates position references from satellite signals and acoustic seabed transponders with the drillship's six to eight thrusters to keep the ship directly over the well that is being drilled. Drillships are selected to drill oil and gas wells for programs that require a high level of simultaneous operations, where drilling loads are expected to be high, or where there are occurrences of high ocean currents, where the drillship's hull shape is the most efficient. There are currently eight drillships in Noble's fleet, capable of water depths from 8,200 feet to 12,000 feet.
Semisubmersibles
Semisubmersible drilling units are designed as a floating drilling platform incorporating one or several pontoon hulls, which are submerged in the water to lower the center of gravity and make this type of drilling unit exceptionally stable in the open sea. Semisubmersible drilling units are generally categorized in terms of the water depth in which they are capable of operating, from the mid-water range of 300 feet to 4,000 feet, the deepwater range of 4,000 feet to 7,500 feet, to the ultra-deepwater range of 7,500 feet to 12,000 feet as well as their generation, or date of construction. This type of drilling unit typically exhibits excellent stability characteristics, providing a stable platform for drilling in even rough seas. Semisubmersible drilling units hold their position over the drilling location using either an anchored mooring system or a DPS and may be self-propelled. Noble's fleet consists of four semisubmersible drilling units, two of which are equipped with mooring systems and two of which utilize DPS, with fleet diversity to operate in mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater depth ranges with high levels of efficiency.
Jackups
Noble's fleet of modern, high-specification jackup drilling units give us the flexibility to provide drilling solutions to our customers who have drilling requirements in the shallower waters of the continental shelf, in depths ranging from less than 100 feet to as deep as 500 feet. Jackup rigs can be used in open water exploration locations, as well as over fixed, bottom-supported platforms. A jackup drilling unit is a towed mobile vessel consisting of a floating hull equipped with three or four legs, which are lowered to the seabed at the drilling location. The hull is then elevated out of the water by the jacking system using the legs to support weight of the hull and drilling equipment against the seabed. Once the hull is elevated to the desired level, or jacked up, the drilling package can be extended out over an existing production platform or the open water location and drilling can commence. Noble's fleet of 12 jackups varies from two standard units capable of drilling in up to 375 feet of water to premium and high-specification units capable of drilling in up to 500 feet of water with drilling hookloads greater than 2,500,000 pounds.

Market
The offshore contract drilling industry is a highly competitive and cyclical business characterized by large capital expenditures and large swings in pricing. Demand for offshore drilling equipment is driven by the exploration and development programs of oil and gas companies, which in turn are influenced by many factors, including the price of oil and gas, the availability and relative cost of onshore oil and gas resources, general global economic conditions, energy demand, environmental considerations and national oil and gas policy.
In the provision of offshore contract drilling services, competition is largely governed by price but involves numerous other factors as well. Rig availability, location, suitability and technical specifications are the primary factors in determining which rig is qualified for a job, and additional factors are considered when determining which contractor is awarded a job, including experience of the workforce, efficiency, safety performance record, condition of equipment, operating integrity, reputation, industry standing and client relations. In addition to having one of the newest fleets in the industry among our peer companies, we strive to keep our equipment well-maintained and technologically competitive.
We maintain a global operational presence and compete in most of the major offshore oil and gas basins worldwide. All of our drilling rigs are mobile, and we may mobilize our drilling rigs among regions for a variety of reasons, including to respond to customer requirements. We compete in both the jackup and floating rig market segments, each of which may have different supply and demand dynamics at a given period in time or in different regions.
Demand for our services is, in significant part, a function of the worldwide demand for oil and gas and the global supply of mobile offshore drilling units. Our industry experienced a significant increase in the number of drilling units prior to and during the period in which crude oil prices declined precipitously and were highly volatile and in which the supply of onshore oil and gas resources expanded greatly. This combination of increased supply of drilling rigs and reduced demand for such rigs has resulted in falling dayrates and heightened competition for opportunities to re-contract our rigs upon expiry of existing contracts. 
We believe that improvements in market conditions will ultimately result from, among other things, improved oil prices, additional investment by our customers in offshore exploration and development, and attrition of rigs in the global offshore fleet. Our young and technologically advanced fleet is well positioned to compete now and in the future as market dynamics improve.
Significant Customers
Offshore contract drilling operations accounted for approximately 96 percent, 98 percent and 97 percent of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, we principally conducted our contract drilling operations in Canada, Far East Asia, the Middle East, the North Sea, Oceania, the Black Sea, Africa, South America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Revenues from Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Shell”), Equinor ASA (“Equinor” formerly known as “Statoil ASA”) and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (“Saudi Aramco”) accounted for approximately 38.8 percent, 15.5 percent, and 14.5 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues from Shell, Equinor and Saudi Aramco accounted for approximately 45.0 percent, 13.2 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenues from Shell and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (“Freeport”) accounted for approximately 37.5 percent and 24.5 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated operating revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
 On May 10, 2016, Freeport, Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC and one of our subsidiaries entered into an agreement terminating the contracts on the Noble Sam Croft and the Noble Tom Madden (“FCX Settlement”), which were scheduled to end in July 2017 and November 2017, respectively. During 2016, we recognized approximately $393.0 million in “Contract drilling services revenue” associated with the FCX Settlement. Excluding the $393.0 million of revenue attributable to the FCX Settlement our primary customers during 2016 would have been Shell, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Freeport, accounting for approximately 45.0 percent, 11.0 percent and 9.0 percent of our consolidated operation revenues, respectively.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,000 employees, excluding approximately 1,000 persons we engaged through labor contractors or agencies. Approximately 84 percent of our workforce is located offshore. We are not a party to any material collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
We place considerable value on the involvement of our employees and maintain a practice of keeping them informed on matters affecting them, as well as on the performance of the Company. Accordingly, we conduct formal and informal meetings with employees, maintain a Company intranet website with matters of interest, issue periodic publications of Company activities and other matters of interest, and offer a variety of in-house training, including through Noble Advances, our state of the art training facility in Sugar Land, Texas.

We are committed to a policy of recruitment and promotion based upon merit without discrimination. Management actively pursues both the employment of disabled persons whenever a suitable vacancy arises and the continued employment and retraining of employees who become disabled while employed by the Company. Training and development is undertaken for all employees, including disabled persons.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Political developments and numerous governmental regulations, which may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry, affect many aspects of our operations. Our contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling units, environmental discharges and related recordkeeping, safety management systems, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and use of local employees, content and suppliers by foreign contractors. A number of countries actively regulate and control the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exportation of oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In addition, government actions, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), may continue to contribute to oil price volatility. In some areas of the world, this government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by oil and gas companies and their need for offshore drilling services, and likely will continue to do so.
The regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or require remediation of contamination under certain circumstances. Many of the countries in whose waters we operate from time to time regulate the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling and marine operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to obtain or comply with permits, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance. Although these requirements impact the oil and gas and energy services industries, generally they do not appear to affect us in any material respect that is different, or to any materially greater or lesser extent, than other companies in the energy services industry. However, our business and prospects could be adversely affected by regulatory activity that prohibits or restricts our customers’ exploration and production activities, results in reduced demand for our services or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us, our customers or the oil and natural gas industry in general.
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws and regulations that apply in the United States and Europe, which serves as an example of the various laws and regulations to which we are subject. While laws vary widely in each jurisdiction, each of the laws and regulations below addresses environmental issues similar to those in most of the other jurisdictions in which we operate.
Offshore Regulation and Safety. In response to the Macondo well blowout incident in April 2010, the U.S. Department of Interior, through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), has undertaken an aggressive overhaul of the offshore oil and natural gas regulatory process that has significantly impacted oil and gas development in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. From time to time, new rules, regulations and requirements have been proposed and implemented by BOEM, BSEE or the United States Congress that materially limit or prohibit, and increase the cost of, offshore drilling. We are also subject to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (“PWSA”) and similar regulations, which impose certain operational requirements on offshore rigs operating in the U.S. and governs liability for vessel or cargo loss, or damage to life, property, or the marine environment. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors —Changes in, compliance with, or our failure to comply with the certain laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations” for additional information.
Spills and Releases. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act in the U.S. (“CERCLA”), and similar regulations, including but not limited to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), adopted by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), as enforced in the United States through the domestic implementing law called the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, impose certain operational requirements on offshore rigs operating in the U.S. and govern liability for leaks, spills and blowouts involving pollutants. OPA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities on “responsible parties” for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility and the lessee or permit holder of the area in which an offshore facility is located. CERCLA and similar state and foreign laws and regulation, impose joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate waste that may fall within the scope of CERCLA's definition of a “hazardous substance.” However, we have to-date not received any notification that we are, or may be, potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.
Regulations under OPA require owners and operators of rigs in United States waters to maintain certain levels of financial responsibility. The failure to comply with OPA’s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement actions. We are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA’s financial assurance and other operating requirements will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
8

Waste Handling. The U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and similar state, local and foreign laws and regulations govern the management of wastes, including the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a “generator” or “transporter” of hazardous waste or an “owner” or “operator” of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility. RCRA and many state counterparts specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. As a result, our operations generate minimal quantities of RCRA hazardous wastes. We do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as they are presently classified, to be significant. However, any repeal or modification of this or similar exemption in similar state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of, and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses with respect to our U.S. operations.
Water Discharges. The U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” and similar state laws and regulations impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. These laws also regulate the discharge of storm water in process areas. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater and storm water. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard has promulgated requirements for ballast water management as well as supplemental ballast water requirements, which includes limits and, in some cases, water treatment requirements applicable to specific discharge streams, such as deck runoff, bilge water and gray water. We do not anticipate that compliance with these laws will cause a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Air Emissions. The U.S. Federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before operations can commence, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits, and incur capital costs, in order to remain in compliance. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In general, we believe that compliance with the Clean Air Act and similar state laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Climate Change. There is increasing attention concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulates the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs, which require the use of “best available control technology” for GHG emissions from new and modified major stationary sources, which can sometimes include drillships. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among other things, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis.
Moreover, in 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which establishes a binding set of emission targets for GHGs, became binding on all countries that had ratified it. In 2015, the United Nations (“U.N.”) Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. Incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas. See Part I, Item1A, “Risk Factors— Governmental laws and regulations may add to our costs, result in delays, or limit our drilling activity” for additional information.
Countries in the European Union (“EU”) implement the U.N.’s Kyoto Protocol on GHG emissions through the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”). The ETS program establishes a GHG “cap and trade” system for certain industry sectors, including power generation at some offshore facilities. Total GHG from these sectors is capped, and the cap is reduced over time to achieve a 21 percent GHG reduction from these sectors between 2005 and 2020. The ETS program will continue to require GHG reductions in the future. Phase 4 of the ETS program (covering 2021 to 2030) was revised in 2018 to achieve emission reduction targets as part of the EU’s contribution to the Paris Agreement. Phase 4 targets a 43 percent GHG reduction between 2005 and 2030.
In addition, the United Kingdom (“UK”) government, which implements ETS in the UK North Sea, has introduced a carbon price floor mechanism to place an incrementally increasing minimum price on carbon. Thus, the cost of compliance with ETS can be expected to increase over time. Additional member state climate change legislation may result in potentially material capital expenditures.
We have determined that combustion of diesel fuel (Scope 1) aboard all of our vessels worldwide is the Company’s primary source of GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The data necessary to report indirect emissions from generation of purchased power (Scope 2) has not been previously collected; however, procedures are being established to collect and report Scope 2 data.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) gas emissions were 954,944 tonnes as compared to 918,439 tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2017. When expressed as an intensity measure of tonnes of CO2e gas emissions per dollar of contract drilling revenues from continuing operations, the intensity measure for December 31, 2018 and 2017 was .0009 and .0008, respectively. 
9

The increase in emissions is due to increases in operational activity from the Noble Tom Madden, Noble Sam Croft, Noble Lloyd Noble, Noble Tom Prosser and activation of the Noble Clyde Boudreaux.
Our Scope 1 CO2e gas emissions reporting has been prepared with reference to the requirements set out in the UK Companies Act 2006 Regulations 2013, the Environmental Reporting Guidelines (June 2013) issued by the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs, the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 14064-1, “Specification with guidance at the organizational level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals (2006).” 
It is our intent to have the procedures related to GHG emissions independently assessed in the future.
Worker Safety. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and other similar laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens. EU member states have also adopted regulations pursuant to EU Directive 2013/30/EU, on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations within the exclusive economic zone (which can extend up to 200 nautical miles from a coast) or the continental shelf. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements and EU directive 2013/30/EU (as well as the extensive current health and safety regimes implemented in the member states in which we operate), but future developments could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with the directive's implementation.
International Regulatory Regime. The IMO provides international regulations governing shipping and international maritime trade. IMO regulations have been widely adopted by U.N. member countries, and in some jurisdictions in which we operate, these regulations have been expanded upon. The requirements contained in the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, govern much of our drilling operations. Among other requirements, the ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies.
The IMO has also adopted MARPOL, including Annex VI to MARPOL which sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. The IMO has also negotiated international conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatory to such conventions such as the Ballast Water Management Convention, (the “BWM Convention”) and the International Convention for Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001 (the “Bunker Convention”). The BWM Convention's implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast of water exchange requirements (beginning in 2009), to be replaced in time with a requirement for mandatory ballast water treatment. The Bunker Convention provides a liability, compensation and compulsory insurance system for the victims of oil pollution damage caused by spills of bunker oil. We believe that all of our drilling rigs are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations. However, the IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulation may have on our operations.
Insurance and Indemnification Matters
Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling business, including blowouts, fires, collisions, groundings, punch-throughs, and damage or loss from adverse weather and sea conditions. These hazards could cause personal injury or loss of life, loss of revenues, pollution and other environmental damage, damage to or destruction of property and equipment and oil and natural gas producing formations, and could result in claims by employees, customers or third parties and fines and penalties.
Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers and in most cases also require us to indemnify our customers for certain losses. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property is typically assigned on a “knock-for-knock” basis, which means that we and our customers assume liability for our respective personnel and property, generally irrespective of the fault or negligence of the party indemnified. In addition, our customers may indemnify us in certain instances for damage to our down-hole equipment and, in some cases, our subsea equipment. Also, we generally obtain a mutual waiver of consequential losses in our drilling contracts. 
Our customers typically assume responsibility for and indemnify us from loss or liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including third-party damages and clean-up and removal, arising from operations under the contract and originating below the surface of the water. We are generally responsible for pollution originating above the surface of the water and emanating from our drilling units. Additionally, our customers typically indemnify us for liabilities incurred as a result of a blow-out or cratering of the well and underground reservoir loss or damage. In the current market, we are under increasing pressure to accept exceptions to the above-described allocations of risk and, as a result, take on more risk. In such cases where we agree, we generally limit the exposure with a monetary cap and other restrictions.

In addition to the contractual indemnities described above, we also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, which is a comprehensive general liability insurance program covering liability resulting from offshore operations. Our P&I insurance includes coverage for liability resulting from personal injury or death of third parties and our offshore employees, third-party property damage, pollution, spill clean-up and containment and removal of wrecks or debris. Our P&I insurance program is renewed in April of each year and currently has a standard deductible of $10 million per occurrence, with maximum liability coverage of $750 million. We also carry hull and machinery insurance that protects us against physical loss or damage to our drilling rigs, subject to a deductible that is currently $10.0 million. 
Our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover our losses and liabilities in all cases. For additional information, please read “We may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future and our insurance coverage and contractual indemnity rights may not protect us against all the risks and hazards we face” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the time of preparation of this report, and is general in nature. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. In addition, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and enforcement of those provisions may be limited by public policy and other considerations.
