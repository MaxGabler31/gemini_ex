Item 1. Business
Company Overview
EMCORE Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “EMCORE”), was established in 1984 as a New Jersey corporation. The Company became publicly traded in 1997 and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EMKR. EMCORE pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world’s first delivery of Cable TV directly on fiber, and today is a leading provider of advanced Mixed-Signal Optics products that enable communications systems and service providers to meet growing demand for increased bandwidth and connectivity. The Mixed-Signal Optics technology at the heart of our broadband communications products is shared with our fiber optic gyros and inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigations systems technology. With both analog and digital circuits on multiple chips, or even a single chip, the value of Mixed-Signal device solutions is often far greater than traditional digital applications and requires a specialized expertise held by EMCORE which is unique in the optics industry. 
EMCORE has fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability through our Indium Phosphide (“InP”) compound semiconductor wafer fabrication facility at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA. The facility supports EMCORE’s vertically-integrated manufacturing for our laser, transmitter and receiver products for Cable TV and other broadband applications, fiber optic gyro sensors for Navigation Systems, and chip devices for Telecom and Datacom applications. 
We currently have one reporting segment: Fiber Optics. This segment is comprised of three product lines: Broadband, Chip Devices and Navigation Systems. Please see our consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in this Annual Report for financial information regarding this segment. Until the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we operated as two segments: Fiber Optics and Photovoltaics. EMCORE's former Solar Photovoltaics business, which was sold in December 2014, provided products for space power applications including high-efficiency multi-junction solar cells, covered interconnect cells and complete satellite solar panels. In addition, as further described below, EMCORE sold certain assets, and transferred certain liabilities, of the Company's telecommunications business, including the ITLA (Integrable Tunable Laser Assembly) micro-ITLA, T-TOSA (Tunable Transmitter Optical Subassembly) and T-XFP (Tunable 10 Gigabit Form Factor Pluggable) product lines within the Company’s telecommunications business, in January 2015. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to the reclassification of prior period amounts related to discontinued operations as a result of the sale of these businesses to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.

Table of Contents

EMCORE, through our vertically-integrated infrastructure, has been able to adapt the same technologies, chip designs and production assets applicable to our CATV products to the development of state-of-the-art Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (“FOG”) that have broad application within the aerospace and defense markets for land, sea, air and space navigation. This gives EMCORE the ability to leverage our high-volume infrastructure for lower volume, higher value-added product. EMCORE has expanded its FOG-based product line to include Inertial Measurement Units (“IMU or IMUs”) and Inertial Navigation Systems (“INS”) that provide superior Size, Weight and Power (“SWaP”) compared to competing or legacy systems. To the extent sales of our navigation system products are related to U.S. government contracts or subcontracts, this portion of the business may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government or an agency thereof.

• | Fiber Optic Gyroscope Products - EMCORE’s FOG program has received multiple U.S. patents and has been qualified for several key military programs for applications including Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”), line-of-site stabilization, aviation and aeronautics. All EMCORE FOGs feature advanced optics with only three components for simplified assembly along with Digital Signal Processing (“DSP”) or Field Programmable Gate Array (“FPGA”) for higher accuracy, lower noise and greater efficiency. The integrated DSP or FGPA also improves optical drift stability and enables higher linearity and greater environmental flexibility. EMCORE’s FOG products range from tactical to navigational grade gyros where the critical specifications for fiber length, Angle Random Walk (“ARW”) and drift rate improves through the product line to provide customers greater flexibility in choosing the performance level that best meets their application.


• | Inertial Measurement Units and Navigation Systems Products - EMCORE’s IMU and INS systems are based on our advanced FOG technology and provide superior SWaP compared to competing systems. Our products provide customers the flexibility to choose options from straightforward IMU operation to full navigation and are higher performance form, fit and function replacements for other IMUs and legacy systems. EMCORE’s IMUs and INS products deliver high-precision with up to five-times better performance than competing units in compact, portable form-factors that provide standalone aircraft grade navigator performance at one-third the size of competing systems. Recently EMCORE launched its new EMCORE-OrionTM series of high-precision Micro Inertial Navigation (MINAV) systems designed primarily for applications where navigation aids such as GPS are unavailable or denied. The advanced technology incorporated enables these systems to provide performance close to that of traditional RLG (Ring Laser) INS with one-third the SWaP. We believe the EMCORE MINAV’s low SWaP makes it an ideal inertial navigation system for unmanned aerial vehicle and dismounted soldier applications, and the units can operate as navigators or very precise IMUs with lower noise and greater stability than competing systems.

In addition, in July 2016, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Asset Sales to pay a special cash dividend to our shareholders of $1.50 per share, or a total of $39.2 million. The dividend was paid on July 29, 2016 to shareholders of record as of July 18, 2016. See Note 14 - Equity for additional information.
Sources of Raw Materials
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and equipment used in our products. We continually review our supplier relationships to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on one or two suppliers for critical components or raw materials. While maintaining inventories that we believe are sufficient to meet our near-term needs, we strive not to carry significant inventories of raw materials. Accordingly, we maintain ongoing communications with our suppliers in order to prevent any interruptions in supply, and have implemented a supply-chain management program to maintain quality and lower purchase prices through standardized purchasing efficiencies and design requirements. To date, we generally have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of critical supplies in a timely manner.
We are subject to rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of "conflict minerals". These rules have imposed and will continue to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to our ability to verify the origin of any "conflict minerals" used in our products.
Manufacturing
We utilize MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) systems that are capable of processing virtually all compound semiconductor-based materials. Our operations include wafer fabrication, device design and production and fiber optic module, subsystem and system design and manufacture. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. We employ a strategy of minimizing ongoing capital investments, while maximizing the variable nature of our cost structure. We maintain supply agreements with key suppliers. Where we can gain cost advantages while maintaining quality and intellectual property control, we outsource the production of certain products, subsystems, components, and subassemblies to contract manufacturers located overseas. Our contract manufacturers maintain comprehensive quality assurance and delivery systems, and we continuously monitor them for compliance. 
Our various manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing. Our facilities have acquired and maintain certification status for their quality management systems. Our manufacturing facilities located in Alhambra, California; and Beijing, China are registered to ISO 9001 standards. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force, application engineers, third party sales representatives and distributors. Our sales force communicates with our customers' engineering, manufacturing, and purchasing personnel to provide optimized customer solutions through product design, qualifications, performance, and price. Our strategy is to use our direct sales force to sell to original equipment manufacturers and key accounts and to expand our use of distribution partners for increased coverage in both international markets and certain domestic segments.
Throughout our sales cycle, we work closely with our customers to qualify our products into their product lines and platforms. As a result, we develop strategic and long-lasting customer relationships with products and services that are tailored to our customers' requirements. We focus our marketing communication efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating our technologies' advantages, and generating leads for our sales force. We use a variety of marketing methods, including our website, participation at trade shows, and selective advertising to achieve these goals.
Externally, our marketing group works with customers to define requirements, characterize market trends, define new product development activities, identify cost reduction initiatives, and manage new product introductions. Internally, our marketing group communicates and manages customer requirements with the goal of ensuring that our product development activities are aligned with our customers' needs. These product development activities allow our marketing group to manage new product introductions and market trends. See Note 15 - Geographical Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to geographic revenue and significant customers.

Research and Development
Our research and development efforts have been focused on maintaining our technological competitive edge by working to improve the quality and features of our product lines. We are also making investments to expand our existing technology and infrastructure in an effort to develop new products and production technology that we can use to expand into new markets. Our industry is characterized by rapid changes in process technologies with increasing levels of functional integration. Our efforts are focused on designing new proprietary processes and products, on improving the performance of our existing materials, components, and subsystems, and on reducing costs in the product manufacturing process.
As part of the ongoing effort to cut costs, many of our projects have focused on developing lower cost versions of our existing products. In view of the high cost of development, we solicit research contracts that provide opportunities to enhance our core technology base and promote the commercialization of targeted products. Generally, internal research and development funding is used for the development of products that will be released within twelve months and external funding is used for long-term research and development efforts.
We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must invest significant financial resources in developing new product features and enhancements and in maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. Research and development expense was $15.4 million, $12.5 million and $9.9 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 18.0%, 10.2% and 10.8% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation expense including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, as well as engineering and prototype costs, depreciation expense, and other overhead expenses, as they relate to the design, development, and testing of our products. These costs are expensed as incurred. 
Intellectual Property and Licensing
We protect our proprietary technology by applying for patents, where appropriate, and in other cases by preserving the technology, related know-how, and information as trade secrets. The success and competitive advantage enjoyed by our product lines depends heavily on our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary technologies. We also acquire, through license grants or assignments, rights to patents on inventions originally developed by others. As of September 30, 2018, we held approximately 55 U.S. patents and approximately 25 foreign patents and had over 5 additional patent applications pending. The issued patents cover various products in the major markets we serve. Our U.S. patents will expire on varying dates between 2019 and 2035. These patents and patent applications claim protection for various aspects of current or planned commercial versions of our materials, components, subsystems, and systems.
We also have entered into license agreements with other organizations, under which we have obtained exclusive or non-exclusive rights to practice inventions claimed in various patents and applications issued or pending in the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions. We do not believe our financial obligations under any of these agreements adversely affects our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
We rely on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property when we believe that publishing patents would make it easier for others to reverse engineer our proprietary processes. We also rely on other intellectual property rights such as trademarks and copyrights where appropriate.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge, and disposal of certain materials used in our research and development and production operations, as well as laws and regulations concerning environmental remediation, homeland security, and employee health and safety. The production of wafers and devices involves the use of certain hazardous raw materials, including, but not limited to, ammonia, phosphine, and arsine. We have in-house professionals to address compliance with applicable environmental, homeland security, and health and safety laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations.

As the markets for our products grow, new competitors are likely to emerge and current competitors may increase their market share. In the European Union (“EU”) and certain countries throughout the world, political and legal arrangements encourage the purchase of domestically produced goods, which places us at a disadvantage in those regions or countries.
There are substantial barriers to entry by new competitors across our product lines. These barriers include the large number of existing patents, the time and costs required to develop products, the technical difficulty in manufacturing semiconductor-based products, the lengthy sales and qualification cycles, and the difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees with the required scientific and technical backgrounds. We believe that the primary competitive factors within our current markets are product cost, yield, throughput, performance and reliability, breadth of product line, product heritage, customer satisfaction, and customer commitment to competing technologies. Competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that offer superior price and performance characteristics. We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must invest significant financial resources in developing new product features and enhancements and in maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide.
Order Backlog
EMCORE's product sales are made pursuant to purchase orders, often with short lead times. These orders are subject to revision or cancellation and often are made without deposits. Products typically ship within the same quarter in which a purchase order is received; therefore, our order backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period and may not be comparable to prior periods.
Seasonality
In certain of our previous fiscal years, we have experienced an increase in revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters due to increased sales of our CATV products resulting from an increased build of cable networks during seasons with warmer weather.
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 391 employees, including approximately 188 international employees that are located primarily in China. This represents an increase of approximately 27 employees when compared to September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in international employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any labor-related work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good.
