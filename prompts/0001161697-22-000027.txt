Management’s Plan to Attract Capital
 
In the near term, management will utilize debt or preferred stock financing to complete assembling the professional and management team to commence the process for clinical trials in compliance with FDA protocol. plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the Company’s business plan. Management will continue to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the Company’s financial obligations. There is no assurance, however, that investors will continue to advance capital to the Company or that the new business operations will be profitable. The possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential inability to achieve profitability raise doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
In the midterm, management will enhance its capital position with a public offering of equity securities to finance clinical trials and the necessary actions to obtain approval of worldwide marketing of our MS treatment
