ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are one of the largest providers of highly engineered industrial process heating solutions for process industries. For over 65 years, we have served a diverse base of thousands of customers around the world in attractive and growing markets, including chemical and petrochemical, oil, gas, power generation, commercial, rail and transit, and other, which we refer to as our "key end markets." We offer a full suite of products (heating units, heating cables, temporary power solutions and tubing bundles), services (engineering, installation and maintenance services) and software (design optimization and wireless and network control systems) required to deliver comprehensive solutions to some of the world's largest and most complex projects. With a legacy of innovation and continued investment in research and development, Thermon has established itself as a technology leader in hazardous or classified areas, and we are committed to developing sustainable solutions for our customers. We serve our customers through a global network of sales and service professionals and distributors in more than 30 countries and through our nine manufacturing facilities on three continents. These global capabilities and longstanding relationships with some of the largest multinational oil, gas, chemical processing, power and engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") companies in the world have enabled us to diversify our revenue streams and opportunistically access high-growth markets worldwide. 
Thermon, Inc., our principal operating subsidiary in the United States, was founded as a partnership in October 1954 and later incorporated in Texas in 1960. At that time, our primary product was a thermally conductive heat transfer compound invented by our founder, Richard Burdick. Under Mr. Burdick's leadership, we experienced steady growth by diversifying our products and expanding our geographic reach. Mr. Burdick and his family maintained a controlling interest in us until August 2007, when the controlling interest was sold to an affiliate of the Audax Group private equity firm. 
On April 30, 2010, an investor group led by entities affiliated with CHS Capital LLC ("CHS") and two other private equity firms, acquired Audax's controlling interest in us.
In May 2011, we completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of our common stock, and our common stock became listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "THR."
In October 2017, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired 100% of the equity interests of CCI Thermal Technologies Inc. and certain related real estate assets for $262.4 million CAD (approximately $204.6 million USD at the exchange rate as of October 30, 2017) in cash. Through this acquisition, we formed a new business line, Thermon Heating Systems ("THS"), which is engaged in industrial process heating, focused on the development and production of advanced heating and filtration solutions for industrial and hazardous area applications and is headquartered in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.
Our corporate offices are located at 7171 Southwest Parkway, Building 300, Suite 200, Austin, Texas 78735. Our telephone number is (512) 690-0600. Our website address is www.thermon.com.

    THS develops, designs and manufactures the following high quality and durable advanced industrial heating and filtration solutions, including the following categories: 
•Environmental heating (branded as “Ruffneck,” "Norsemen," and “Catadyne”) - provides electric or gas-powered space heating for both hazardous and non-hazardous areas;
•Process heating (branded as “Caloritech”) - provides highly engineered heating products to multiple end-markets with the purpose of heating and maintaining a process fluid at specified temperatures. Some products also serve the transportation sector with both radiant and convection-style heating;
•Filtration (branded as “3L Filters”) - provides highly specialized filtration solutions for the most stringent environments, including the nuclear industry; and
•Rail and Transit (branded as “Hellfire,” "Velocity," “ArcticSense” and others) - provides heating applications to both rolling stock (rail cars) and rail infrastructure (track and switch).
Project Services
As a manufacturer and global expert in process heating solutions, our EPC and end-user customers often rely on Thermon to deliver a range of project services, which may include:
•Engineering and design;
•Procurement and project management services;
•Turnkey construction installation;
•Recurring facility assessment or audit; and
•Maintenance services.
Our customers rely on Thermon’s design and engineering expertise on projects around the world. These services are combined with our heat tracing and process heating products under one contract to deliver an integrated solution that improves the overall value proposition for the customer. By delivering design drawings in conjunction with early project specifications, we can address our customer needs for design optimization studies, product selection assistance and computer-generated drawing packages. Often these are new facilities (which are discussed further below under the section "Customers"), but they may also include upgrades or expansions and maintenance projects where our existing customers are upgrading their facilities. Project services are important to our business model and growth strategy to secure contracts that both establish and enhance new and existing customer relationships.
Our services are automated by custom software technology. We have invested over years to develop software that assists our experts in the design, specification, and automatic creation of CAD drawings. Our project engineering staff empowered with this software technology can execute the largest projects, including the creation of thousands of drawings, accurately and with efficiency that cannot be matched by manpower alone.
Project services also include full turnkey solutions whereby we contract to install a complete heat tracing or process heating solution. We refer to this as our construction business which is primarily located in the southern United States near many of our customers in the downstream and mid-stream petroleum, chemical and power generation industries.
Manufacturing and Operations
We have nine manufacturing facilities and two smaller assembly facilities, which complement our manufacturing operations. Most of our heat tracing products are manufactured in our facility in San Marcos, Texas, including flexible heating cables, control systems and tubing bundles. Process Heating products are primarily manufactured at our Canadian facilities. We have smaller manufacturing locations in the Netherlands and Russia, and we have small assembly operations in Pune, India and Houston, Texas. We maintain a high level of operational efficiency and excellent quality standards in all our manufacturing facilities through the use of automated processes and rigorous quality control checkpoints and procedures.
Our San Marcos, Texas operation includes an Electron Cross-Linking Facility that is used to stabilize the resin material in our low-temperature self-regulating heating cables. Ownership of this operation allows us to have complete control of the manufacturing process, enhancing quality and reducing the lead time by about six weeks. Some of the base heating cable that is produced in San Marcos is shipped to our different sites to reduce lead time and to satisfy local content requirements.
Pre-insulated tubing products are manufactured in our facilities in San Marcos and the Netherlands and are primarily made to the individual customer’s specifications. The process includes application of a thermal insulation over one or more process tubes, along with an electric heat trace cable or steam heating tube, and a protective plastic outer jacket that is extruded onto the bundle to protect the insulation. 
Our process heating solutions are manufactured in various plants in Canada. The Edmonton facility largely manufactures environmental heating products. The Orillia facility manufactures tubular heaters, including our mineral insulated ("MI") heating cable that is supplied to OEM customers and other Thermon facilities. The Oakville location specializes in our engineered solutions and our Calgary facility fabricates electric heat trace circuits using the MI cable produced in Orillia. Thermon Power Solutions is a product line that provides temporary power distribution and lighting products that are primarily fabricated at a facility in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
Thermon transportation heating products are assembled at our facilities in Edmonton, Alberta and Denver, Colorado. This includes both solutions for rail car heating and rail track heating.
Our primary distribution centers are located in San Marcos, Texas; Edmonton, Alberta; Pijnacker, the Netherlands; and Moscow, Russia. Inventory is typically shipped from these distribution centers directly to customers, the construction site or our regional sales agents or distributors. Our sales agents may maintain "safety stocks" of core products to service the immediate maintenance and repair requirements of customers who are time-sensitive and cannot wait for delivery from one of the central distribution centers. In the United States, a network of representatives maintain safety stocks of core products. In Canada, 
customers are serviced from the five manufacturing locations in Calgary, Edmonton, Fort McMurray, Orillia and Oakville. In Europe, customers are serviced from the central distribution center in the Netherlands. In Asia, safety stock of materials are kept in Yokohama, Japan; Seoul, Korea; Shanghai, China; Pune, India; and Melbourne, Australia. Safety stocks are also warehoused in Moscow, Russia and Mexico City, Mexico. Thermon aims to have inventory available close to the customer to fulfill urgent needs.
Customers
We serve a broad base of large multinational customers, many of which we have served for more than 60 years. We have a diversified revenue mix with thousands of customers. None of our customers represented more than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020.
Customers typically purchase our products when constructing a new facility, which we refer to as Greenfield projects, or when performing MRO/UE on a facility's existing heat-traced pipes or upgrading or expanding a current facility.
Marketing
Our direct sales force is focused on positioning us with major end-users and EPC companies during the development phase of Greenfield projects with the goal of providing reliable, cost-effective process heating solutions. We utilize a network of more than 100 independent sales agents and distributors in over 30 countries to provide local support to customer facilities for maintenance, repairs and upgrades. In addition to focused EPC sales, Thermon is actively engaged in commercial strategies to address a diversified mix of customers in our key end markets. Revenue diversification is a key long-term strategic initiative for the business. We believe that we have established our credibility as a reliable provider of high-quality process heating products. In addition, we believe that our registered trademarks in the United States and numerous additional brand names are recognized globally, giving us excellent brand recognition.
Standards and Certifications
Thermon’s research and development practices ensure our product designs are validated to market requirements and verified to comply with applicable industry standards. We actively participate in the growth and development of the domestic and international electrical standards established in the countries in which we sell products. We continually test our products through a quality control process to demonstrate they can withstand harsh operating environments. They are subjected to various tests, including heat output, thermal stability and long-term aging, with the goal of producing products capable of performing at or beyond the expectations of our customers. All products are further tested and certified for global use by various approval agencies, such as UL, CSA, FM, and ETL, to meet industry leading international standards.
    In order to support the design and development of industrial products rated for operation in potentially hazardous environments, Thermon holds quality system approvals which employ the appropriate oversight requirements. To support the international business, Thermon is audited annually by an Ex Certification Body such as DEKRA, and we hold a Quality Assurance Notification and Quality Assurance Report to IEC/ISO 80079-34. To support the North American business, Thermon is audited quarterly by many nationally recognized test labs including but not limited to UL, CSA, FM, and ETL, to OSHA and Standards Council of Canada requirements. In addition, Thermon also pursues various regional and maritime certifications such as DNV, ABS, EAC, KOSHA and many more. In addition, all of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001 certified, which allows us to continue to produce safe, reliable products certified for operating in potentially hazardous environments.
    Over the last three decades, Thermon has made significant investments to actively participate in standardization at the national and international level. We are active in several committees such as the National Electrical Code (NEC), Canadian Electrical Code (CEC), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), National Electrical Equipment Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). We leverage our extensive expertise and knowledge in industrial process heating technology to continually improve the applicable standards of our industry.
Markets
    The major end markets that drive demand for process heating include chemical and petrochemical, up-, mid- and downstream oil, gas, power generation, commercial and rail and transit. We believe there are attractive long-term trends in each of these end markets. 
•Chemical and Petrochemical. Process heating is required for temperature maintenance and freeze protection in a variety of chemical processing applications. Factors that may impact process heating demand in chemical and petrochemical end markets include the rapid industrialization of the developing world, a shift in base chemical processing operations to low-cost feedstock regions, a transition of Western chemical processing activities from commodity products to specialty products and environmental compliance.
•Gas. Process heating is in the production and transmission of gas in upstream, midstream, and downstream applications. Despite recent market volatility, gas markets have remained resilient over the last twelve months, 
especially as a feedstock for petrochemical plants, and represent a significant and growing addressable market for our value added solutions. This includes the global and growing market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) compression and regasification facilities.
•Oil. Process heating is used to facilitate the exploration, production, processing, transportation and distribution of oil and oil-based energy products in upstream, midstream, and downstream oil applications. While the demand forecast for oil can be unpredictable, e.g., the COVID impact on transportation fuels, we have a sizable installed base that provides recurring revenue, especially in the downstream refining market.
•Power Generation. Process heating is required for high-temperature product maintenance, freeze protection and environmental regulation compliance in coal and gas facilities and for safety systems in nuclear facilities. An important driver of demand for process heating solutions for power generation is increasing demand for electricity worldwide, with an increasing prevalence of renewable power generation solutions. 
•Rail and Transit. Process heating is required to safely clear and heat rail switches, melt snow and ice from platforms, and provide comfort heating and defrosting in rolling stock. With over 1.1 million kilometers of operational railway in the world, rail is still one of the most economical and safe solutions for passengers and products globally. 
•Commercial. Process heating is required for hospitals, hospitality/lodging, universities and secondary education, and light industrial facilities to provide freeze protection, temperature regulation, process control, and supporting laboratory environments. The electrification of heating products and removal of combustion-based heating solutions in urban areas drives demand for our products. 
•General Industries and Other. We serve a growing number of other markets where we add value for customers, such as mining and mineral processing, maritime/shipbuilding, semiconductors, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, food and beverage, data centers, and renewables.
Our ability to provide technology design, such as wireless network controls and design software is an increasing factor in our customers' decision to purchase our products.
Segments
    We operate in four reportable segments based on four geographic countries or regions in which we operate: (i) United States and Latin America ("US-LAM"), (ii) Canada, (iii) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and (iv) Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Profitability within our segments is measured by operating income. See Note 19, "Segment Information" for financial data relating to our four reportable geographic segments.
Competition
    The global industrial electric heat tracing industry is fragmented and consists of more than 30 companies, which typically only serve discrete local markets and provide a limited-service offering. We believe that we are the second largest participant in the industrial electric heat tracing market and one of only a few solution providers with a comprehensive suite of products and services, global capabilities, and industry-leading controls technology, which includes our design software products. Our most significant competitor is the thermal management segment of nVent Electric plc (NYSE: NVT).
    Following the THS acquisition in October 2017, we entered the broader industrial process heating market. The industrial process heating market, which includes industrial heat tracing, tends to be fairly fragmented with several smaller companies serving discrete local markets with limited offerings. Our competitors vary by end-market, but generally we view nVent Electric, NIBE, Watlow and Spirax Sarco as competitors in various areas across the spectrum of end-markets we now serve.
Industrial process heating providers differentiate themselves through value-added services, long-term customer relationship management and the ability to provide a full range of solutions. We differentiate ourselves from local providers by maintaining a global footprint, a full suite of products and services and a track record with some of the largest multinational energy, chemical processing, power and EPC companies in the world. In addition, we are almost entirely dedicated to providing thermal solutions and complementary products and services whereas some of our competitors' thermal solutions operations constitute only one of numerous operating segments.
Intellectual Property and Technology
The industrial process heating industry, as well as the complementary markets where we intend to expand, are highly competitive and subject to the introduction of innovative techniques and services using new technologies. While we have patented some of our products and processes, we historically have not relied upon patents to protect our design, manufacturing processes or products, and our patents are not material to our operations or business. Instead, we rely significantly on maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, other proprietary rights and other information related to our operations. Accordingly, we require all employees to sign a nondisclosure agreement to protect our trade secrets, 
business strategy and other proprietary information. We rely on registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States and abroad and have many recognized brand names.
Our research and development activities are focused on identifying new technologies to enhance our industrial process heating solutions and meet the evolving needs of our customers. This maximizes safety and product reliability and reduces the customer's total cost of ownership, which consists of capital expenses, maintenance costs and energy costs. Current product development initiatives include polymer research and continued advancement of integrated control and monitoring systems. Software development activities include advanced heat tracing network monitoring communication software and engineering design software initiatives.
Resources
Our critical raw materials include polymers, graphite, copper and stainless steel. For most of these materials, we purchase from multiple suppliers to avoid any potential disruption of our manufacturing operations. For a small number of raw material items that require specific quality specifications, we have single source supply arrangements. We manage the inherent supply risk through purchase contracts and increased safety stock levels. We evaluate pricing and performance of all suppliers annually. For our low volume custom-built electronic controller components, we select a single supplier based on past performance reliability and closely monitor the process as volumes are too low to divide this product over multiple suppliers. More than half of the components we purchase by cost are off-the-shelf items and are readily available from multiple sources. Our purchase specifications are usually based on industry or manufacturer standards. Testing of the raw materials is performed and documented by our suppliers and is reviewed by us at the time of receipt. While our manufacturing locations are predominantly in North America, we operate an “in the region, for the region” strategy to diversify our supplier base, manage costs and hold inventory across our various sites. We employ a screening mechanism for conflict materials as part of our supplier approval and management processes. Use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (3TG) in our purchased components is minimal. We have established a process to collect and report conflict minerals use in order to meet all regulatory and customer requirements. We use limited amounts of magnesium, graphite and platinum in our processes and these commodities are sourced from multiple suppliers to ensure availability. The quantities we consume of these materials are insignificant compared to the global production and usage.
Government Contracts
We do not have any material portion of our business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the U.S. government's election.
Government Regulation
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to complex United States and foreign laws governing, among others, anti-corruption matters, export controls, economic sanctions, anti-boycott rules, currency exchange controls and transfer pricing rules. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, or the "IRS," Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, or "BIS," the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, or "OAC," and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or "OFAC," as well as the counterparts of these agencies in foreign countries. Since the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian war in February 2022, many countries in which we operate have imposed significant economic sanctions upon Russia and certain individuals and entities with connections to the Russian government. These sanctions are evolving rapidly and have become significantly more stringent over time. Violations of these sanctions can result in significant penalties and civil and criminal liabilities. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the recent economic sanctions. Despite our training and compliance programs, no assurances can be made that we will be found to be operating in full compliance with, or be able to detect every violation of, any such laws. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
 In addition, our operations and properties are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the emission of greenhouse gases, and workplace health and safety. Certain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs, without regard to fault, on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, we could become liable to third parties for damages resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment. Some of our sites are affected by soil and groundwater contamination relating to historical site operations, which could require us to incur expenses to investigate and remediate the contamination in compliance with environmental laws. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. A failure to obtain, maintain, and comply with these permit requirements could result in substantial penalties, including facility shutdowns. From time to time, we could be subject to requests for information, notices of violation, and/or investigations initiated by environmental regulatory agencies relating to our operations and properties. Violations of 
environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and facility shutdowns. Environmental and health and safety laws may change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we could incur costs for past, present, or future failure to comply with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we could become subject to potential regulations concerning the emission of greenhouse gasses or the disclosure thereof, and while the effect of such future regulations cannot be determined at this time, they could require us to incur substantial costs in order to achieve and maintain compliance. In the ordinary course of business, we may be held responsible for any environmental damages we may cause to our customers' premises.
Other than our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with other government regulations has not had, and based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See the section titled Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for additional information on government regulation that could impact our business.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our people are one of our most important investments and greatest assets. The success and growth of our business depend on our ability to attract, develop, incent and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified and highly skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including our executive officers, and across our global workforce. Our culture enables us to achieve our vision to be the world leader in industrial process heating. At the heart of our culture are our core values of Care, Commit and Collaborate. 
Our Board of Directors (the "Board") provides important oversight on certain human capital matters through its Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee (the "HCMC Committee"). The HCMC Committee maintains oversight over our strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including our compensation and benefit programs, leadership succession planning, culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, and talent development programs. The Company’s management proactively manages our human capital and cares for our employees in a manner that is consistent with our values.
Employee Health and Safety
We believe nothing is more important than the health, safety, and well-being of our people. We work hard to achieve best in class levels of safety through the application of policies and best practices. We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries, supported by effective communication, reporting, and external benchmarking. We hold regular talks and events on key safety topics, including reporting all injuries, hazards, near-misses, and case management to prevent reoccurrence. We also participate in industry groups, within and outside the manufacturing, construction, and energy sectors, to share safety best practices and collaborate to address safety concerns.
Our Safety Record
Any loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable. We did not have any fatal incidents at any of our facilities or job sites in fiscal 2022. We primarily track two key safety indicators in monitoring our safety efforts, total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) and lost-time incident rate (“LTIR”). Our TRIR increased from 0.07 in fiscal 2021 to 0.27 in fiscal 2022 and our LTIR stayed at 0.00, the same as fiscal 2021. We are proud of our superior safety rating in both the manufacturing and construction industries. TRIR and LTIR are defined as the Company’s number of recordable injuries/loss time, respectively, experienced by employees during the fiscal year multiplied by 200,000 divided by the number of man hours worked during the fiscal year.
In addition to TRIR and LTIR, we also measure total near miss and hazard ID reporting as well as case management metrics. These aid in accident prevention, which we believe is critical to incident avoidance and supports our superior safety rating in the industry. 
COVID-19 Response
Throughout fiscal 2022, we remained operational in order to support our customers while still supporting and protecting our employees. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately mobilized our office employees to a work-from-home environment and ensured that our essential manufacturing and field construction employees were kept safe with proper personal protective equipment. In addition, we deployed new safety policies and guidelines based on recommendations from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as local health organizations. Our ability to ensure business continuity and employee welfare and safety was the result of the Company’s early planning, and a well-designed enterprise business continuity plan. This plan was led by our Critical Response Team, which is comprised of senior leadership who collaborated with designated site leaders around the globe to implement COVID-19 specific polices and guidelines that addressed the regional requirements of the population. 
In fiscal 2022, we offered a vaccine incentive to our employees in the U.S. and Canada to encourage them to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and report their vaccination status to help ensure business continuity. 
Workforce Breakdown
On March 31, 2022, we employed 1,227 employees, of which 39.4% were located in the U.S. and Latin America, 35.8% in Canada, 11.6% located in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), and 13.2% located in Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). We also contracted with 105 contingent workers as of March 31, 2022. Our 12-month rolling voluntary turnover rate as of March 31, 2022, was 16.0% compared to the 2021 manufacturing industry average of 10.4% according to Aon 2021 Salary Increase and Turnover Study – Second Edition. Our fiscal year differs from the period covered by the AON study, but we believe it is the best proxy to benchmark against. We are committed to reducing our voluntary turnover and management will continue to work to that end. Approximately 0.8% of our global employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any union-related work stoppages in the past, and we believe that our working relationship with our employees is positive. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe in the benefits of an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged, and empowered to inspire innovative ideas and decisions. We have locations in 15 countries, and our employees operate across cultures, functions, unique languages, and time zones to solve the technical and logistical challenges presented by a worldwide customer base. Our diversity statistics include the following as of March 31, 2022, (based on self-reporting at the date of hire): 25.0% of our employees worldwide identify as females; 23.9% of our employees in the U.S. identify as female; and 47.1% of our employees in the U.S. identify as a racial or ethnic minority.
In fiscal 2022, we continued the diversity initiatives initiated in fiscal 2021 and added diversity metrics that directly affect the short-term incentive payments for our executive officers. These metrics are specific to our U.S. salaried workforce and include, increasing diversity in candidate interview slates; decreasing new hire turnover of diverse talents; and increasing overall diversity. 
We know we have more to do when it comes to increasing the representation of historically underrepresented groups within our global workforce, and we are taking action to ensure Thermon is an employer of choice for diverse candidates.
Talent Development 
In fiscal 2022, the Company expanded its talent review program to include not only the executives and their direct reports, but also the next level of employees. This program identifies emerging leaders and high-potential employees, succession planning, and development plans for select employees. Certain employees from this program were selected and enrolled in a targeted development program and assigned an executive mentor. 
Additionally, the Company created and implemented the “Level Up” job structure for direct labor employees in the U.S. This program sets forth a transparent career path with clear roles, levels, minimum pay rates, and provides employees with information and tools to manage their career at Thermon. 
Furthermore, the Company uses a robust performance management by objective process that identifies goals and reinforces the Company's values through an evaluation process twice per year. 
Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and to attract and retain talent. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country and region) include annual bonuses for all regular full and part time employees globally, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, and scholarship programs for children and grandchildren of employees. 
For the 2022 benefit year in the U.S., Thermon discounted the health insurance premiums for our lower wage workers without increasing premiums for other employees, increased the 401(k) match, implemented a wellness program, expanded paid maternity leave, and introduced paid parental leave and family creation benefits for employees.
In addition to our broad-based programs, we use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of key personnel, particularly those with critical domain expertise necessary to deliver on the long-term strategic initiatives of the Company.
Employee Retention 
To address our employees’ desire for work-life balance, we implemented a remote work policy for employees who can do their work remotely or in a hybrid capacity. 
Additionally, the Company undertook a series of market reviews by location and implemented compensation adjustments where necessary. 
Seasonality
Demand for our products depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures by many of our customers and end-users, in particular those customers in the oil, gas, refining, chemical processing and transportation markets. These customers' expenditures historically have been cyclical in nature and vulnerable to economic downturns. In addition, quarterly revenues for the heat tracing business are impacted by the level and timing of large Greenfield projects that may be occurring at any given time, such as the several large, one-time projects which contributed to revenue in fiscal 2022.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate based on the cyclical pattern of industries to which we provide heat tracing solutions and the seasonality of demand for our heat tracing products. Most of our heat tracing customers perform preventative maintenance prior to the winter season, typically making our second and third fiscal quarters the largest for related revenue. However, revenues from Greenfield projects are not seasonal and depend on the capital spending environment and project timing. Our operating expenses remain relatively consistent with some variability related to the overall headcount of the Company.
Our revenue derived from industrial process heating products typically experiences more pronounced seasonality than our legacy heat tracing business, with a noticeable increase in revenue and profitability typically beginning in the third fiscal quarter and continuing during the winter months through the end of the fourth fiscal quarter.
