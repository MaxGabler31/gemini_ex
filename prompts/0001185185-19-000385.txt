ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Isramco, Inc., (NASDAQ: ISRL) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1982 (hereinafter, “we”, the “Company” or “Isramco”). The Company together with its subsidiaries is an independent oil and natural gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and production of predominately oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the United States and offshore Israel. The Company also operates a production services company that provides a full range of onshore production services to oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies conducting operations in the United States.
 
We currently conduct our operations through two operating segments: our Exploration, Development and Production Segment and our Production Services Segment. The following is a description of these two operating segments. Financial information about our operating segments is included in Note 11, “Segment Information”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Exploration, Development and Production Segment
 
At December 31, 2018, our estimated total proved oil, natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firms, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., were approximately 40,267 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (“MBOE”), consisting of 2,125 thousand barrels (MBbls) of oil, 223,915 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and 823 thousand barrels (MBbls) of natural gas liquids. Approximately 67.2% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed (See Note 14, “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information”). Full year 2018 production averaged 3.75 MBOE/d compared to 3.78 MBOE/d in 2017. Tamar Field production share amounted to 2.57 MBOE/d out of total 3.75 MBOE/d compared to 2.46 MBOE/d in 2017.
United States
 
We, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, are involved in oil and gas exploration, including the development, production and operation of wells in the United States. We own varying working interests in oil and gas wells in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado and currently serve as operator of approximately 422 producing wells located mainly in Texas and in New Mexico.
Israel
 
In 2007, we closed our branch in Israel in order to focus on our expanding presence in the United States. Despite the closure of that branch we retained certain overriding royalties in three oil and gas licenses located offshore Israel. These licenses granted by the government of Israel are known as the “Michal”, “Matan” and “Shimshon” Licenses.
 
In 2009, two natural gas discoveries, known as “Tamar” and “Dalit”, were made within the area covered by the Michal and Matan Licenses, respectively. In December 2009, the Israeli Petroleum Commissioner granted Noble Energy, Inc. (“Noble”) and its partners, (the “Tamar Consortium”), two leases (the “Tamar Lease” and the “Dalit Lease”). The Leases are scheduled to expire in December 2038 and cover the Tamar and Dalit gas fields (collectively the “Tamar Field”). The Tamar Field is approximately 95 kilometers off the coast of the Israel, in the Israel exclusive economic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean, with a water depth of approximately 1,700 meters.
 
We own all ownership units in Tamar Royalties LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Tamar Royalties LLC owns an overriding royalty interest of 1.5375% before payout which escalates to 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (collectively the “Tamar Royalty”). An overriding royalty interest is an ownership interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate equating to a certain percentage of production or production revenues, calculated free of the costs of production and development of the underlying lease(s), but subject to its proportionate share of certain post production costs. An overriding royalty interest is a non-possessory interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate and, accordingly, we have no control over the operations, drilling, expenses, timing, production, sales, or any other aspect of development or production of the Tamar Field.
 
Production from the Tamar Field commenced in March 2013. The Tamar Field is now operational and delivering natural gas to Israel. The natural gas flows from the Tamar Field through the world’s longest subsea tieback, more than 90 miles to the Tamar platform, and then to the Ashdod onshore terminal (AOT).

With regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between the Company and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to what costs should be included in the calculation of payout. In addition to actual costs for the development of the Tamar Field, Isramco, Negev 2 Limited Partnership has asserted that the following costs should be included in the calculation of payout: (i) Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership’s financing costs; (ii) the general and administrative expenses of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership; (iii) the expected decommissioning costs of the Tamar Field; and (iv) expected future payments to be made in respect of the “Sheshinsky Levy” under Israeli law. In addition to the claim asserted by Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership, the Company has asserted counterclaims related to Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership’s inclusion into the payout calculation of its expenses related to gathering and transportation infrastructure. The disagreements primarily stem from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. At the time of initiating arbitration, the Company believed that the total scope of the claim was approximately forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000); however, this amount increases each month based on Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership’s failure to pay the increased, post-payout overriding royalty to the Company. In addition, certain claims asserted by the Company related to post production costs and pipeline infrastructure have not been quantified. Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company believes that the claims of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership are erroneous and contrary to generally accepted industry practice. The Company expects that the matter will be favorably resolved through this arbitration process; however, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result in this arbitration process.
 
The Tamar Consortium currently sells natural gas from the Tamar Field to the Israel Electric Corporation (“IEC”) and numerous other Israeli purchasers, including independent power producers, cogeneration facilities, local distribution companies and certain industrial companies. Currently, many of the Tamar Consortium’s gas purchase and sale agreements provide for sales at a 7 to 15 year term, while some contracts have extension options of up to 2 years. Depending on the specific contract, prices may vary and are based on an initial base price subject to price adjustment provisions, including price indexation and a price floor. The IEC contract provides for price reopeners (sometimes referred to as “price review” clauses) in the eighth and eleventh years of the contract, subject to limits on the amount of increase or decrease from the existing contractual price.
 
During year ended December 31, 2018, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,591,000 Mcf of natural gas and 7,335 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.49 per Mcf and $62.95 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $31,036,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $7,138,000 of this revenue.
 
During year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.
 
During year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000 of this revenue.
 
We have a third party reserve report from independent petroleum engineers, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. dated March 11, 2019 estimating reserves allocable to the Tamar Royalty as of December 31, 2018 (the “Tamar Reserve Report”). This reserve report estimates that by reason of the Company’s ownership of the Tamar Royalty, we have proven reserves estimated at 213.5 million cubic feet of natural gas and 278 thousand barrels of natural gas liquids. The Tamar Reserve Report indicates the undiscounted estimated future net revenue (after deduction of estimated production, ad valorem taxes and levy but before estimated income tax) for such reserves (paid out over time) to be $703.9 million. The Tamar Reserve Report estimates the net present worth of such reserves, discounted at 10% annual discount rate factor, at $321.9 million (See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information”). The gas price used to value the reserves in the Tamar Reserve Report is calculated in accordance with SEC rules based on the unweighted arithmetic price for each month within the 12-month period prior to December 31, 2018. The report indicates that there are no commercial oil deposits included as reserves.
 
The amount of proceeds we receive from the Tamar Royalty is contingent on a variety of factors including the timing of production and the price received. In the event of payout, the Tamar Royalty increases. Payout is the point when all the costs of leasing, drilling, producing and operating the leases have been recovered from lease production proceeds, as defined in the royalty agreements under which we acquired our interest.

As we do not control any of the factors affecting our rights to payments (time of production, price received, costs incurred) and as a result of the other risk factors as set forth below in “Risk Factors,” we cannot determine the amounts or timing of any payments we will receive or when payout is likely to occur, if ever. As discussed above, the determination of the occurrence of payout with respect to the Tamar Royalty is currently the subject of a disagreement with Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership. The Company believes that the disagreement will be resolved through a forthcoming arbitration process with Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership. Based on the reserves and anticipated production, the income from the Tamar Royalty is currently expected to be very significant to the Company for the foreseeable future.
 
Commercial production of the Tamar Field reserves is subject to numerous risks, including all of the typical risks associated with offshore oil and gas production. Commercial production of such reserves is also subject to additional risks that may be unique to the Tamar Field. These include:
 

● | There has been no previous large-scale production of natural gas from offshore Israel. Therefore, there may be geological, geophysical, or other unforeseen problems unique to offshore Israel that could affect production. In addition, because of the lack of comparable production history for this part of offshore Israel, the length of time that large scale production from offshore Israel can be sustained is uncertain.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There has been significant political upheaval and unrest in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. In addition, there is considerable hostility between Israel and other countries in the region. Accordingly, there is significant risk that production from the Tamar Field may be delayed, diminished, or prevented by virtue of war, acts of terrorism, or other similar or dissimilar events of force majeure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The market for natural gas in Israel exists, but the financial ability of customers of the Tamar Consortium to take and pay for material amounts of such natural gas remains unclear. It is uncertain that existing customers and markets are capable of buying all of the anticipated production from the Tamar Field.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Israel Antitrust Authority continues to monitor the Israeli natural gas market, including Noble and the Tamar Consortium, and could impose additional regulations or requirements on the Noble or the Tamar Consortium which could include a requirement to divest of some or all of their ownership or require all or any of them to separately market their proportionate share of production.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As noted above, the Company owns an interest in the Shimshon license located offshore Israel.  In April of 2012, a well was drilled in the area covered by the Shimshon license, which has been recognized as a commercial discovery by the Israeli government. The Shimshon partners submitted an application to convert the Shimshon license to a lease. Terms of the lease are in discussion with the Israeli government’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources.
 
Production Services Segment
 
The Company began production services operations in September 2011. Our production servicing rig and truck fleet provides a range of production services, including the completion of newly-drilled wells, maintenance and workover of existing wells, fluid transportation, related oilfield services and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives to a diverse group of oil and gas exploration and production companies.

● | Completion Services. Newly drilled wells require completion services to prepare the well for production. Production servicing rigs are frequently used to complete newly drilled wells to minimize the use of higher cost drilling rigs in the completion process. The completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing in the productive zones to allow oil or gas to flow into the well bore, stimulating and testing these zones, and installing the production string and other downhole equipment. The completion process typically ranges from a few days to several weeks, depending on the nature and type of the completion, and generally requires additional auxiliary equipment in addition to a production services rigs. The demand for completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels, which are sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Well-servicing/Maintenance Services. We provide maintenance services on the mechanical apparatus used to pump or lift oil from producing wells. These services include, among other activities, repairing and replacing pumps, sucker rods and tubing. We provide the rigs, equipment and crews for these tasks, which are performed on both oil and natural gas wells, but which are more commonly required on oil wells. Maintenance services typically take less than 48 hours to complete. Rigs generally are provided to customers on a call-out basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Workover Services. Producing oil and natural gas wells occasionally require major repairs or modifications, called “workovers.” Workovers may be required to remedy failures, modify well depth and formation penetration to capture hydrocarbons from alternative formations, clean out and recomplete a well when production has declined, repair leaks or convert a depleted well to an injection well for secondary or enhanced recovery projects. Workovers normally are carried out with pumps and tanks for drilling fluids, blowout preventers, and other specialized equipment for servicing rigs. A workover may last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fluid Services. At December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 35 fluid service trucks equipped with an average fluid hauling capacity of up to 130 barrels a piece. Each fluid service truck is equipped to pump fluids from or into wells, pits, tanks and other storage facilities. The majority of our fluid service trucks are also used to transport water to fill frac tanks on well locations, to transport produced salt water to disposal wells, and to transport drilling and completion fluids to and from well locations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Plugging Services. Production servicing rigs are also used in the process of permanently closing oil and gas wells no longer capable of producing in economic quantities. Many well operators bid this work on a “turnkey” basis, requiring the service company to perform the entire job, including the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the compensation received, and complying with state regulatory requirements. Plugging and abandonment work can provide favorable operating margins and is less sensitive to oil and gas pricing than drilling and workover activity since well operators must plug a well in accordance with state regulations when it is no longer productive. We perform plugging and abandonment work throughout our core areas of operation in conjunction with equipment provided by us or by other service companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We typically bill clients for our production servicing on an hourly basis for the period that the rig is actively working. As of December 31, 2018, our fleet of production servicing rigs totaled 33 rigs, which we operate through 5 locations in Texas and New Mexico. Our fleet is capable of working at depths from 14,000 to 25,000 feet, and as of December 31, 2018, our fleet consists of one 600 series rig, twenty-eight 550 series rigs, and four 300 series rigs.
 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
From time to time we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with interest rate risk and/or the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We may hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production current and subsequent. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to derivative contracts, which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations. We carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs.
 
On June 16, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC (“Tamar Royalties”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, engaged in an interest rate swap agreement (“IRS Agreement”) with the Deutsche Bank AG London Branch (“DBAG”). An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties (known as counterparties) where one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on a specified notional principal amount. Interest rate swaps often exchange fixed interest payments for floating interest payments that are linked to interest rates.
 
As previously disclosed on the Company’s Form 8-K filed May 22, 2015, Tamar Royalties entered into a $120,000,000 credit facility with Deutsche Bank, which facility is discussed further in Note 6 “Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under the terms of this facility, Tamar Royalties, is required to hedge at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding balance under this facility against fluctuations in LIBOR, with at least thirty-seven and one-half percent (37.5%) of the outstanding balance being hedged through swaps. The notional value of these hedges corresponds to the amortization schedule covering the facility and previously disclosed in the aforementioned Form 8-K. Accordingly, on June 16, 2015, Tamar Royalties and DBAG entered into the IRS Agreement whereby the Company hedged $119,250,000 of the $120,000,000 initial borrowing as follows:
 
(a) Tamar Royalties hedged 37.5% of the perpetual outstanding balance under the facility, being an initial notional amount of $45,000,000, with a fixed rate swap whereby the Company will pay DBAG a fixed interest rate of 4.63%, and DBAG will pay the Company a monthly floating interest rate of USD-LIBOR-BBA plus a spread of 2.75%.
 
(b) Tamar Royalties hedged the remaining 62.5% of the perpetual outstanding balance less $750,000, being an initial notional amount of $74,250,000, against fluctuations in LIBOR by capping the fluctuations in LIBOR at 1.50%. Pursuant to the IRS Agreement, the Company will pay DBAG a fixed interest rate of 0.91%, and DBAG will pay the Company the greater of (i) USD-LIBOR-BBA minus a cap strike of 1.5% and (ii) zero.

Competitive Conditions in the Business
 
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with many other companies that have greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, as well as carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. There are also many production services companies that compete for the same customers as we compete. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, obtaining purchasers and transporters of the oil and natural gas we produce and hiring and retaining key employees during active times in the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of the United States and in some instances individual states where we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. 
 
Our production services customers include major oil companies and mid-range independent oil and natural gas production companies. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition is influenced by such factors as price, capacity, availability of work crews, and reputation and experience of the service provider. We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. We believe many of our large customers place increased emphasis on the safety, performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work. However, in several instances, we have secured and maintained work for large customers for which efficiency, safety, technology, size of fleet, and availability of other services are of equal importance to price.
 
Markets and Major Customers
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, we operate a substantial portion of our domestic oil and natural gas properties. As the operator of a property, the Company makes full payment of the costs associated with each property and seeks reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the property for their share of those costs. Our joint interest partners consist primarily of independent oil and natural gas producers. If the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general were adversely affected, the ability of the Company’s joint interest partners to reimburse the Company could be adversely affected.
 
The purchasers of the Company’s United States based oil and natural gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and gas pipeline companies. During the year ended December 31, 2018 no purchaser, marketer, or major oil and gas or pipeline company accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. The Company has not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts as to its sales of oil and gas production. The Company does not believe the loss of any one of its purchasers would materially affect the Company’s ability to sell the oil and natural gas it produces. The Company believes other purchasers are available in the Company’s areas of operations.
 
The Company’s overriding royalty interest in the Tamar field is paid monthly by Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership, a related party. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 income from this source accounted for 38% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. If Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership were to stop receiving revenue from its working interest in the Tamar Field, we would not receive revenue from our overriding royalty interest (the Tamar Royalty). Loss of payments from this source would cause significant financial consequences to the Company.
 
Our production service subsidiary customers include major oil and natural gas production companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and usually do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for potential credit losses when necessary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, no one individual customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues. The Company believes the loss of one or more customers of our production service subsidiary would not have a significant effect on this Segment because the Company believes that it can employ its rigs with other existing customers or new customers to the extent it has in the past in such circumstances.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can disrupt our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher natural gas prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.

Operational Risks
 
Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other circumstances may cause accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids, into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. 
 
We carry insurance against such hazards. However, as is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business, either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. For further discussion on risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
Regulations
 
We do not have any offshore operations in the United States. However, all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate oil and natural gas properties regulate exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. These laws and regulations include provisions requiring permits to drill wells and requirements that we obtain and maintain a bond or other security as a condition to drilling or operating wells. Regulations also specify the permitted location of and method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells.
 
Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a given area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from fields and individual wells. The effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing.
 
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability.
 
Each state in which we operate also imposes some form of production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. We are liable for paying this tax on our production, and are also liable for various real and personal property taxes on our leases and facilities.
 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 
The oil and gas industry in the United States is subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Many governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) have issued lengthy and comprehensive regulations to implement and enforce these laws. These laws and regulations often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities.
 
In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. We endeavor to fully comply with these regulatory requirements; however, compliance increases our costs and consequently affects our profitability.
 
As a part of the overall environmental regulatory policy, the permitting, construction and operations of certain oil and gas facilities are regulated. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Once operational, enforcement measures can include significant civil penalties for regulatory violations, regardless of intent. Under appropriate circumstances, an administrative agency can issue a cease and desist order to require termination of operations.
 
 10


Environmental regulation is becoming more comprehensive and additional programs, as well as increased obligations under existing programs, are anticipated. In this regard, we expect additional regulation of naturally occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, waste management, and underground injection of water and waste material. The adoption of additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases the Company’s overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or results of operations. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that Isramco will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations. However, given that such laws and regulations are subject to change, Isramco is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on its operations, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and Hazardous Substances
 
In 1980, the United States Congress enacted the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law. This law, which has been amended since enactment, and comparable state laws impose strict liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of what are considered to be “hazardous substances” into the environment. These persons include the current or former owners or operators of the sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, we may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment whether or not we are responsible for the release or even owned an interest in the site at the time of the release, as well as for damages to natural resources and for the costs of health studies. In addition, companies that incur liability frequently confront additional claims because it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment in addition to a CERCLA claim.
The Solid Waste Disposal Act and Waste Management
 
The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, regulates the disposal of solid waste but generally excludes most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, such as drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes may be regulated by the EPA or state agencies as non-hazardous wastes as long as these wastes are not commingled with regulated hazardous wastes. Moreover, in the ordinary course of our operations, other wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate these materials or wastes. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential liabilities to which we may be subject from unknown, latent liability risks with respect to any properties where materials or wastes may have been released, but of which we have not been made aware.
 
The Clean Water Act, wastewater and storm water discharges
 
The oil and gas industry, generally, and our operations specifically, are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general permit. Some of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff and, as part of our overall evaluation of our current operations, we may apply for storm water discharge permit coverage and updating storm water discharge management practices at some of our facilities. We believe that we will be able to obtain, or be included under, these permits, where necessary, and be required make only minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that we believe would not have a material effect on us. The Clean Water Act and similar state acts regulate other discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages.

These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. More specifically, we are required to develop and maintain a plan applicable to each of our properties at which any significant volume of crude oil or other substance is stored and to ensure the site has sufficient protections (such as berms, etc.) to ensure that any spill will be contained and not reach navigable waters.
 
The Safe Drinking Water Act, groundwater protection, and the Underground Injection Control Program
 
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SWDA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program promulgated under the SWDA and state programs all regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state. This program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling salt water disposal well. Monitoring the integrity of well casing must also be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking saltwater to groundwater. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
 
We have engaged in limited hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services on the wells for which we are the operator by engaging third parties to conduct these operations on our behalf. For non-operated properties, the operators have applied and may choose to apply in the future hydraulic-fracturing techniques on properties in which we share interest.
 
The Clean Air Act
 
The federal Clean Air Act, enacted in 1970, and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations under the authority of the Clean Air Act governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations.
 
Some of our operations may be located in areas designated as “non-attainment” areas, which are geographic areas that do not meet the federal air quality standards. Air emission controls and requirements in non-attainment areas are generally more stringent that those imposed in other areas, and the construction of new, or expansion of existing, sources may be restricted.
 
Climate change
 
The issue of “global warming” has attracted significant attention and many believe that emissions of certain gases contribute to this problem. Many nations have agreed to limit emissions of “greenhouse gases” pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the “Kyoto Protocol.” Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products, are considered “greenhouse gases” regulated by the Kyoto Protocol. Although the United States is not participating in the Kyoto Protocol, several states have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect our operations and demand for our products.
 
In summary, we may be subject to EPA greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting rules, and potentially new EPA permitting rules if adopted, that would apply greenhouse gas permitting obligations and emissions limitations under the federal Clean Air Act. Whether or not any federal greenhouse gas regulations are enacted, more than one-third of the states have begun taking action on their own to control and/or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Several multi-state programs have been developed or are in the process of being developed, including the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative involving 10 Northeastern states, the Western Climate Initiative involving seven western states, and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord involving seven states. The latter two programs have several other states acting as observers and they may join one of the programs at a later date. Any of the climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Legislative initiatives and discussions to date have focused on the development of cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Cap-and-trade programs could be relevant to us and our operations in several ways. First, the equipment we use to explore for, develop, produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases. We could therefore be subject to caps, and penalties if emissions exceeded the caps. Second, the combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as the oil, gas and NGLs we sell, emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Therefore, demand for our products could be reduced by imposition of caps and penalties on our customers. Carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment and/or emissions resulting from use of our products by our customers. Application of caps or taxes on companies such as Isramco, based on carbon content of produced oil and gas volumes rather than on consumer emissions, could lead to penalties, fees or tax assessments for which there are no mechanisms to pass them through the distribution and consumption chain where fuel use or conservation choices are made. Moreover, because oil and natural gas are used as chemical feedstocks and not solely as fossil fuel, the Company believes that applying a carbon tax to oil and gas at the production stage would be excessive with respect to actual carbon emissions from petroleum fuels.
 
The National Environmental Policy Act
 
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are potentially subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
 
Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and natural resources
 
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties, may act to prevent oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat, or natural resources resulting from drilling, construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and may seek compensation for alleged natural resources damages and in some cases, criminal penalties.
 
Hazard communications and community right to know
 
We are subject to federal and state hazard communications and community right to know statutes, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and regulations. These regulations govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances. 
 
Occupational Safety and Health Act
 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, commonly referred to as OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
Hydraulic Fracturing
 
Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand or other proppant materials, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.

As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, and the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior (“BLM”), and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements. Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Certain municipalities have already banned hydraulic fracturing, and courts have upheld those moratoria in some instances. In the past several years, dozens of states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.
 
At the federal level, the EPA has issued final Clean Air Act regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; finalized regulations in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including, for example, notice to and pre-approval by BLM of the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities; development and pre-approval by BLM of a plan for managing and containing flowback fluids and produced water recovered during the hydraulic fracturing process; implementation of measures designed to protect usable water from hydraulic fracturing activities; and public disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid. The rule has been challenged in federal court and implementation has been stayed pending a final decision. 
 
In addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. The adoption of new federal rules or regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could lead to increased operating costs, delays and curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which in turn could materially adversely affect our operations. Several governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, we do not believe that this multi-year study report provides any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
 
Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
