 Item 1.  Business.
 General Development of Business
 During November 2015, the board of directors of Liberty Interactive Corporation, now known as Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate Retail”) authorized management to pursue a plan to distribute to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock shares of a newly formed entity, Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. ("Expedia Holdings," the "Company," “us,” “we,” or “our” as discussed below) (the "Expedia Holdings Split-Off"). Expedia Holdings was formed as a Delaware Corporation in 2015. Immediately following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Expedia Holdings was comprised of, among other things, Qurate Retail's former ownership interest in Expedia Group, Inc. ("Expedia"), as well as Qurate Retail's former wholly-owned subsidiary Vitalize, LLC (which we refer to as Bodybuilding.com (“Bodybuilding”)). As of December 31, 2018, Expedia Holdings beneficially owned approximately 16.2% of the outstanding Expedia common stock and 53.0% of the voting interest in Expedia. Bodybuilding became a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail in October 2015 when Qurate Retail purchased the remaining ownership interest in Bodybuilding. 
 The Expedia Holdings Split-Off occurred on November 4, 2016. Following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Expedia Holdings and Qurate Retail operate as separate, publicly traded companies. The Expedia Holdings Split-Off was intended to be tax-free to Qurate Retail and the former stockholders of Liberty Ventures. In February 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) completed its review of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and informed Qurate Retail that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Qurate Retail received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.
 Historically, Qurate Retail was (and, following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the Company is) a party to a stockholders agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”) with Mr. Barry Diller, Chairman of the Board and Senior Executive Officer of Expedia, pursuant to which Mr. Diller held an irrevocable proxy (the “Diller Proxy”) over all the shares of Expedia common stock ("EXPE") and Expedia class B common stock (the “Expedia class B common stock,” and together with EXPE, the “Expedia common stock”) then owned by Qurate Retail. Qurate Retail was also subject to a governance agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) with Expedia which provided for the right to nominate 20% of the members of Expedia's board of directors, which was comprised of 13 members (three of which were nominated by Qurate Retail). The Governance Agreement also provided for registration and other rights and imposed certain restrictions on the ownership of shares of Expedia class B common stock. Pursuant to the Governance Agreement, Qurate Retail had (and, following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the Company has) preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of shares of Expedia common stock (excluding certain issuances related to options, warrants or convertible securities) so that Qurate Retail or the Company, as applicable, would or will maintain the identical ownership interest in Expedia (subject to certain adjustments) that it had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (but not in excess of 20.01%). Any purchase by Qurate Retail or the Company, as applicable, would or will be allocated between EXPE and Expedia class B common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that Qurate Retail or the Company, as applicable, opted or opts to acquire shares of EXPE in lieu of shares of Expedia class B common stock. Based on the Stockholders Agreement and the Governance Agreement, the Company determined that, prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, it did not control Expedia but instead had significant influence with respect to Expedia and accordingly, accounted for its investment in Expedia as an equity method affiliate. 
 In connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, (a), the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement were assigned by Qurate Retail to the Company and (b) Mr. Diller ceased to directly control a majority voting interest in Expedia by irrevocably assigning (the “Diller Assignment”) the Diller Proxy to the Company for a period of time up to 18 months following completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off (the “Outside Date”), subject to certain termination events as described in the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2016, among Mr. Diller, John C. Malone (“Malone”), Leslie Malone (“Mrs. Malone” and together with Malone, the “Malone Group”), Qurate Retail and the Company (the “Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement” and the date on which such termination event occurs, the “Proxy Arrangement Termination Date”). On March 6, 2018, the Company, Qurate Retail, Mr. Malone, Mrs. Malone and Mr. Diller entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”), which amended the termination provisions of the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement to extend the Outside Date for an additional one year period.  As a result, unless sooner terminated upon the occurrence of certain events or the taking of certain actions, in either case, as set forth in the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement, as amended 

 
  I-1

 
by the Letter Agreement, the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date will occur, and the Transaction Agreement together with certain Subject Instruments (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) will terminate, on May 4, 2019. By virtue of (i) certain governance rights with respect to the Company as set forth in the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation (the “Restated Charter”), an amendment to the Stockholders Agreement and the Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement and (ii) the grant by the Malone Group to Mr. Diller of an irrevocable proxy to vote, subject to certain exceptions, shares of the Company’s common stock beneficially owned by the Malone Group upon the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off or thereafter for a period of time ending upon termination of Mr. Diller's assignment of the Diller Proxy (the arrangements described in clauses (i) and (ii), together with the Diller Assignment, the “Proxy Arrangements”), Mr. Diller will be able to elect and replace the directors of the Company who will determine how the Company will exercise certain rights and vote the shares of EXPE and Expedia class B common stock owned by the Company in the election of Expedia directors, though Malone will retain the ability to remove such directors of the Company. The rights under the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement, each as assigned and amended, will be maintained even upon termination of the Proxy Arrangements. As a result, Expedia Holdings began consolidating Expedia as of the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, as Expedia Holdings then controlled a majority of the voting interest in Expedia. 
 On February 1, 2019, a member of Expedia management, as authorized by a special committee of disinterested directors formed by the Board of Directors of Expedia (the “Special Committee”), conveyed to a member of the Company’s management a proposal for Expedia to acquire the outstanding shares of the Company in a business combination transaction in which the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A and Series B common stock would be exchanged for newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Expedia (the “Expedia Common Stock”).  Over the course of the next two days, the member of Expedia management, as authorized by the Special Committee, and the member of the Company’s management, as authorized by a committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, engaged in discussions regarding a possible exchange ratio for the transaction. As of the date of this Annual Report, (i) Expedia management had last proposed a possible exchange ratio of 0.347 of a share of Expedia Common Stock, and (ii) the Company’s management had last proposed a possible exchange ratio of 0.373 of a share of Expedia Common Stock, in each case, for each outstanding share of the Company’s Series A and Series B common stock, and subject to the negotiation of mutually acceptable transaction agreements.
     The Company and Expedia expect that there may be continued discussions among the parties regarding a potential transaction and related matters, including the terms of any continuing governance agreement between Mr. Diller and Expedia.  There can be no assurance that the continued discussions will result in the entry into a definitive agreement concerning a transaction (or the terms and conditions thereof) or, if such a definitive agreement is reached, will result in the consummation of a transaction provided for in such definitive agreement.  Discussions concerning a possible transaction may be terminated at any time and without prior notice. The Company does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the foregoing unless and until its Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of Expedia have approved a specific transaction, if any, except as may be required by law.

 Portfolio of Brands
 Expedia operates a strong brand portfolio with global reach, targeting a broad range of travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers. Expedia knows that consumers typically visit multiple travel websites prior to booking travel, and having a multi-brand strategy increases the likelihood that those consumers will visit one or more of its websites. Expedia also markets to consumers through a variety of channels, including internet search and metasearch and social media websites, and having multiple brands appear in search results also increases the likelihood of attracting visitors. In addition, Expedia's brands tailor their product offerings and websites to particular traveler demographics. For example, Hotwire finds deep discount deals for the budget-minded travel shopper while the Classic Vacations brand targets high-end, luxury travelers. Brand Expedia spans the widest swath of potential customers with multi-product travel options across a broad value spectrum, while the Hotels.com brand focuses specifically on a hotel only product offering.

 Growth Strategy
 Global Expansion.    The Expedia, Hotels.com, Egencia, and Expedia Partner Solutions brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale, including in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America. In addition, ebookers offers multi-product online travel reservations in Europe and Wotif.com, Wotif.co.nz, lastminute.com.au, lastminute.com.nz and travel.com.au, are focused principally on the Australia and New Zealand markets. The HomeAway portfolio has 55 vacation rental websites all around the world. Expedia owns a majority share of trivago, a leading metasearch company. Officially launched in 2005, trivago is one of the best known travel brands in Europe and North America. In December 2016, trivago successfully completed its initial public offering and trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “TRVG.” In addition, Expedia has commercial agreements in place with Ctrip International, Ltd. (“Ctrip”) and eLong, Inc. (“eLong”) in China, Traveloka in Southeast Asia, as well as Despegar in Latin America, among many others. In conjunction with the commercial arrangements with Traveloka and Despegar, Expedia has also made strategic investments in both companies. In 2018, approximately 38% of Expedia’s worldwide gross bookings and 45% of worldwide revenue were through international points of sale compared to just 21% for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005. Expedia has a goal of generating more than two-thirds of its revenue through businesses and points of sale outside of the United States.
 In expanding its global reach, Expedia leverages significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that it has made since the launch of Expedia.com in 1996. More recently, Expedia has invested in migrating parts of its platform to the cloud, as well as focused on expanding its lodging supply in key focus markets around the world. Expedia’s scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations it introduces on behalf of its travelers and suppliers. Expedia believes that its size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with its supply partners, provide breadth of choice and travel deals to its traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for its customers such as its loyalty programs. The size of Expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes its sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers. In addition, the sheer size of Expedia’s user base and search query volume allows Expedia to test new technologies very quickly to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process, and then roll those features out to its worldwide audience to drive improvements in conversion.
 Product Innovation.    Each of Expedia’s leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space for more than two decades. Each Expedia technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team, which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options. Expedia made key investments in technology, including significant development of its technical platforms that make it possible for Expedia to deliver innovations at a faster pace. Improvements in Expedia’s global platforms for Hotels.com and Brand Expedia, continue to enable it to significantly increase the innovation cycle, thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands. Since 2014, Expedia has acquired Travelocity, Wotif Group and Orbitz Worldwide, including Orbitz, CheapTickets and ebookers, and migrated their brands to the Brand Expedia technology platform. In addition, Orbitz for Business customers were migrated to the Egencia technology platform in 2016. In 

 
  I-6

 
2015, Expedia acquired HomeAway, including all of its brands. Expedia intends to continue leveraging these technology investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as proprietary and user-generated content for travelers. 
 Channel Expansion.    Technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings. In the past few years, each of Expedia’s brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends, and many of Expedia’s brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional PCs. Mobile bookings continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed with a much shorter booking window than Expedia historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods. Additionally, Expedia’s brands are implementing new technologies like voice-based search, chatbots and messaging apps as mobile-based options for travelers. In addition, Expedia is seeing significant cross-device usage among its customers, who connect to Expedia’s websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process. Expedia also believes mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition, increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers, particularly through mobile applications. During the year ended December 31, 2018, more than one in three Expedia transactions globally were booked on a mobile device.
 Business Models
 Expedia makes travel products and services available both on a stand-alone and package basis, primarily through the following business models: the merchant model, the agency model and the advertising model. In addition, Expedia’s HomeAway business facilitates vacation rental bookings, earning per transaction commissions, traveler service fees or a combination, and provides subscription-based and other ancillary services to property owners and managers. 
 Under the merchant model, Expedia facilitates the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from its travel suppliers and Expedia is the merchant of record for such bookings. The majority of Expedia’s merchant transactions relate to hotel bookings. Under the agency model, Expedia facilitates travel bookings and acts as the agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider. Expedia receives commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler.
 Expedia continues to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with its core merchant product through its Expedia Traveler Preference (“ETP”) program by offering, for participating hotels, customers the choice of whether to pay Expedia in advance under Expedia’s merchant contract (Expedia Collect) or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay (Hotel Collect). Growth in Expedia’s ETP contracts has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs, and as Expedia continues to expand the breadth and depth of its global hotel offering, it has made adjustments to its economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions. Based on these dynamics, Expedia expects its revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future.
 Through various of the Expedia-branded and other multi-product websites, travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component. Travelers typically select packages based on the total package price, without being provided component pricing, and Expedia has started to introduce a “shopping cart” style feature that incorporates an overall package discount after a traveler selects multiple products. The use of the merchant travel components in packages enables Expedia to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models. In addition, Expedia also offers third-party pre-assembled package offerings, primarily through its international points of sale, further broadening its scope of products and services to travelers. Expedia expects the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model.
 Under the advertising model, Expedia offers travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through its various media and advertising offerings on trivago and its transaction-based websites.

 Relationships with Travel Partners
 Overview.    Expedia makes travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies, large and small commercial airlines, car rental companies, cruise lines, destination service providers, HomeAway property owners and managers and other travel partners. Expedia seeks to build and maintain long-term, strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”) partners. An important component of the success of Expedia's business depends on its ability to maintain its existing, as well as build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners.
 Travel Suppliers.    Expedia strives to deliver value to its travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative, targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs. Expedia's strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through Expedia's points of sale, including participation in need-based, seasonal and event-driven promotions and experimentation within the new channels Expedia is building.
 Expedia developed proprietary technology to assist hotel suppliers in managing, pricing and marketing their supply. Expedia’s “direct connect” technology allows hotels to upload information about available products, services and rates directly from their central reservation systems and to automatically confirm hotel reservations made by Expedia travelers. Proprietary marketing tools assist hotels in tailoring demand to their requirements and Expedia’s revenue management product provides pricing insight based on Expedia data and analytics. Expedia’s suite of white label website offerings power hotel, package and meeting space booking on suppliers' own websites.
 In addition, HomeAway's vacation rental listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers, which enables them to manage an availability calendar, reservations, inquiries and the content of the listing, as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume.
 Distribution Partners.    GDSs, also referred to as computer reservation services, provide a centralized, comprehensive repository of travel suppliers' 'content'—such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline point-to-point flights, or 'segments'. The GDSs act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies, allowing agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel products. Expedia's relationships with GDSs primarily relate to its air business. Expedia uses Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport as its GDS segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for Expedia's travelers.
 Marketing and Promotions
 Expedia's marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of its various brands, drive traffic and ultimately bookings through its various brands and businesses, optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position its brands in relation to one another. Expedia's long-term success and profitability depend on its continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through its brand and shared global platforms in a cost-effective manner, as well as its ability to attract repeat customers to its websites.
 Expedia's marketing channels primarily include online advertising, including search engine marketing and optimization, as well as metasearch, social media websites, offline advertising, loyalty programs, mobile apps and direct and/or personalized traveler communications on its websites as well as through direct e-mail communication with its travelers. Expedia's marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from its travel suppliers based on its supplier relationships. Expedia's traveler loyalty programs include Hotels.com Rewards on Hotels.com global websites and Expedia® rewards on over 30 Brand Expedia points of sale, as well as Orbitz Rewards on Orbitz.com. The cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in Expedia's consolidated financial statements.
 Expedia also makes use of affiliate marketing. The Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Travelocity, Orbitz, CheapTickets and HomeAway, Wotif and lastminute.com.au branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clicked-through to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites. Affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a Brand Expedia, Hotels.com or HomeAway co-branded offering or a private label website. Expedia's Expedia Partner Solutions business provides its affiliates with technology and access 

 
  I-8

 
to a wide range of products and services. Expedia manages agreements with thousands of third-party affiliate partners, including a number of leading travel companies, pursuant to which it pays a commission for bookings originated from their websites.
 Operations and Technology
 Expedia operates several technology platforms that support its brands. The Brand Expedia technology platform supports Expedia’s full-service and multi-product brands, including Brand Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, CheapTickets, ebookers and Expedia Local Expert, as well as certain parts of the Hotwire brand. The Hotels.com technology platform supports Expedia’s hotel-only offering, including Hotels.com and Expedia Partner Solutions. In addition, Expedia operates Egencia, its corporate travel platform; HomeAway, Expedia’s alternative accommodations platform; and trivago, the metasearch platform.
 All of Expedia’s transaction-based brands share and benefit from its eCommerce platform infrastructure, including customer support, data centers and transaction processing capabilities.
 Expedia provides 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week traveler sales and support by telephone or via e-mail. For purposes of operational flexibility, Expedia uses a combination of outsourced and in-house call centers. Expedia's call centers are located throughout the world, including outsourced operations in the Philippines, El Salvador, Egypt and India. Expedia invested significantly in its call center technologies, with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of its call center agents, and has plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward.
 Expedia's systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations, mainly in the United States, which have 24-hour monitoring and engineering support. These data centers have their own generators and multiple back-up systems. Significant amounts of Expedia's owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities. Additionally, Expedia is in the midst of a multi-year project to migrate products, data storage and functionality and significantly increase its utilization of public cloud computing services, such as Amazon Web Services. For some critical systems, Expedia has both production and disaster-recovery facilities. Expedia's technology systems are subject to certain risks, which are described in "Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors."
 Intellectual Property
 Expedia's intellectual property rights, including its patents, trademarks, copyright, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, are important components of its business. For example, Expedia relies heavily upon its intellectual property and proprietary information in its content, brands, domain names and website URLs, software code, proprietary technology, ratings indexes, informational databases, images, graphics and other components that make up its services. Expedia has acquired some of its intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions, as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties.
 Expedia protects its intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, Expedia enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use Expedia's trade secrets or its intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which, if discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties.
 Expedia maintains its trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices, maintaining appropriate registrations, securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. Expedia also registers copyrights and domain names as it deems appropriate. Expedia protects its trademarks, copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses. Trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought, sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where Expedia operates. Contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract.
 Expedia has considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by Expedia. Expedia also 

 
  I-9

 
protects some inventions and methods by maintaining them as trade secrets – either because it provides superior and potentially longer-termed protection, or because the invention is not patentable but provides Expedia with a competitive advantage. 
 In connection with its copyrightable content, Expedia posts and institutes procedures under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar Host Privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs, text and other content uploaded by users.  However, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, and moderation efforts may affect its ability to claim immunity.
 Seasonality
 Expedia generally experiences seasonal fluctuations in the demand for its travel services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Because revenue for most of Expedia’s travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for its hotel business and can be several months or more for its vacation rental business. Historically, HomeAway has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of Expedia's variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which it typically realizes in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of its fixed costs. Furthermore, operating profits for Expedia's primary advertising business, trivago, have typically been experienced in the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as Expedia typically increases marketing during the busy booking period for spring, summer and winter holiday travel. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The continued growth of Expedia's international operations, advertising business or a change in its product mix, including the growth of HomeAway, may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future, and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in short-term impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends. 
 Terms of Investment in Expedia
 Historically, Qurate Retail was a party to a Stockholders Agreement with Mr. Diller, pursuant to which Mr. Diller held an irrevocable proxy over all the shares of Expedia common stock owned by Qurate Retail. In connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and the proxy arrangements, the Stockholders Agreement was assigned to us and amended to permit the assignment of the Diller Proxy to our company through the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date pursuant to the proxy arrangements. As a result, we began consolidating Expedia as of the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, as Expedia Holdings then controlled a majority of the voting interest in Expedia for accounting purposes. Additionally, in conjunction with the application of acquisition accounting, we recorded a full step up in basis of Expedia along with a gain between our historical basis and the fair value of our interest in Expedia. Qurate Retail was also subject to a Governance Agreement with Expedia, which was assigned to us in connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and which provides us following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, with certain director nomination and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on the ownership of shares of Expedia class B common stock. We will maintain our rights under the Governance Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, each as assigned and amended, even upon termination of the proxy arrangements.
 Bodybuilding
 Bodybuilding is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Bodybuilding is primarily an Internet retailer of dietary supplements, sports nutrition products, and other health and wellness products. Bodybuilding markets approximately 300 globally recognized brands, including brands exclusive to its retail channel. Through its website and mobile applications, Bodybuilding offers directly to its customers one of the largest varieties of supplements, vitamins, minerals, exercise products, apparel and exercise equipment, with approximately 12,000 stock keeping units, and delivers its products primarily through its fulfillment centers. Bodybuilding is one of the largest e-retailers in the nutritional and dietary-supplement industry, based on data from the Nutritional Business Journal. Bodybuilding's website, Bodybuilding.com, was launched in 1999 and currently includes more than 17,000 pages of editorial content, 7,000 videos and 16,000 pages of store content.
 Visitors to Bodybuilding's website include approximately 21 million monthly unique visitors that create an inclusive online fitness community that allows people of all health and fitness levels to track their progress and discuss goals, techniques, supplementation and achievements. Providing customers with the information, motivation and supplements necessary to reach 

 
  I-10

 
and maintain their health and fitness goals perpetuates website traffic, continued engagement and both product and content-related purchases. Bodybuilding primarily generates revenue from the online sale of products and content, through Bodybuilding's website and mobile applications. In addition, a limited amount of revenue is generated through digital advertising.
 Bodybuilding's performance is affected by industry trends including, among others, demographic trends and health and lifestyle preferences, as well as other factors, such as competition, industry media coverage and governmental actions. For example, the dietary supplement industry is subject to potential regulatory enforcement activity, consumer suits, and other legal matters that could: (i) affect the credibility and consumer confidence of a given product or category of products; (ii) prevent it from marketing and advertising certain products; or (iii) cause Bodybuilding to recall and remove certain products from the market. Consumer trends may be influenced by current economic conditions, limited product innovation, and introductions in the vitamins, minerals and supplements (“VMS”) industry can dramatically affect purchasing patterns. Even though Bodybuilding's business model allows it to respond to changing industry trends by introducing new products and adjusting its product mix and offering sales incentives, such actions may not fully alleviate adverse trends.
 Product Offerings
 Bodybuilding's sports nutrition consumers look for products to help maintain or supplement a healthy lifestyle. These products are used in conjunction with cardiovascular conditioning, weight training, overall wellness, and sports activities. Sports nutrition supplements include protein and weight gain powders, meal replacements, weight management, energy production, recovery enhancement and pre- and post-workout supplements. Bodybuilding’s sports nutrition products are offered in many convenient forms, such as powders, tablets, capsules, soft gels and liquids. In 2018, these products generated approximately 80% of Bodybuilding's revenue, with protein, pre-workout and post-workout supplements representing the majority at 40%, 16% and 15% of revenue, respectively. Bodybuilding’s other products outside of the sports nutrition category include items such as multivitamins, herbs, minerals, botanicals, probiotics, apparel and accessories. Bodybuilding also offers content through an exclusive subscription service that gives its customers access to expert-designed, gym-proven fitness and nutrition plans.  Suppliers 
 Bodybuilding partners with a large number of suppliers; however, approximately 70% of inventory purchases are concentrated with its top eight suppliers. Bodybuilding's largest supplier accounted for approximately 27% of its merchandise purchases in fiscal year 2018. Bodybuilding considers numerous factors in selecting its suppliers, including, among others, quality, price, credit terms, and product offerings. Bodybuilding does not typically enter into fixed-term supply agreements with its vendors. Bodybuilding strives to maintain sufficient inventory to enable it to meet customer demand and provide a high level of service to its customers. Seasonality
 Bodybuilding's business is slightly seasonal. The first quarter of a given calendar year, when consumers implement their New Year's resolutions related to health and fitness, accounts for the largest percentage of company sales by quarter.  Intellectual Property
 Bodybuilding's intellectual property (including trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets and proprietary technologies) is a critical part of its business. Bodybuilding owns or has rights to trademarks and trade names that are used in conjunction with its business and products. Additionally, Bodybuilding has created and owns product formulations for its private label products, and relies on trade secrets and various licensing opportunities to maintain its competitive standing in the marketplace. To protect its intellectual property, Bodybuilding relies on a combination of domestic and international laws and regulations (including patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws); proactive enforcement of its intellectual property rights; as well as contractual obligations and restrictions both internally and externally. Bodybuilding is also a party to several intellectual property license agreements relating to products, ingredients, formulations, and software. The scope and duration of Bodybuilding’s intellectual property protection varies by jurisdiction and subject matter throughout the world.

 Regulatory Matters
 Internet Services
 Our online commerce businesses are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various laws and governmental regulations. Certain of these businesses engaged in the provision of goods and services over the Internet must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) adopted regulations implementing COPPA. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. Federal legislation enacted in 2016 permanently extended the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce.
 Our online commerce businesses are subject to domestic and foreign laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. In particular, the collection and use of personal information by companies has received increased regulatory scrutiny on a global basis. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which established new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information, took effect in May 2018. Further, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the "Safe Harbor Framework," which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union nations for use in the U.S. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the Safe Harbor Framework, became fully operational on August 1, 2016, but is the subject of litigation in the European Union. The European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications in 2017 which remain pending, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as "cookies." Finally, countries in other regions, most notably Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be enforced. 
 In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and Congress may consider legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. California also has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which, among other things, allows California consumers to request that certain companies disclose the types of personal information collected by such companies.  The CCPA takes effect on January 1, 2020. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), which could subject our Internet businesses to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security are growing public concerns. If consumers were to decrease their use of our Internet businesses' websites to purchase products and services, the businesses could be harmed. Congress and individual states may consider additional online privacy legislation.
 Goods sold over the Internet also must comply with traditional regulatory requirements, such as the FTC requirements regarding truthful and accurate claims. Other Internet-related laws and regulations enacted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. The future adoption of such laws or regulations may slow the growth of commercial online services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a 

 
  I-12

 
decline in the demand for the services and products of our online commerce businesses and increase their costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, the applicability to commercial online services and the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation is uncertain and could expose these companies to substantial liability.
 In 2015, the FCC adopted rules in its open Internet proceeding that restricted the ability of broadband providers to block or otherwise disadvantage our businesses. Among other things, the open Internet rules prohibited Internet service providers from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic. On December 14, 2017, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order and Order (“2017 Order”) that, among other things, eliminates these prohibitions.  The 2017 Order does require Internet service providers to disclose information to consumers regarding practices such as throttling, paid prioritization and affiliated prioritization.  Various parties have challenged the 2017 Order in court.  Legislative proposals regarding the open Internet rules also are pending in Congress and in some states.  On September 30, 2018, California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, which establishes many of the requirements adopted by the FCC in its open Internet rules in 2015.  California has agreed not to enforce the new law pending the resolution of a petition for review of the FCC’s 2017 Order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and any subsequent proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court.
 Proposed Changes in Regulation.    The regulation of Internet services, online sales and other forms of product marketing is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
 Expedia
 Expedia must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry, the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services, including registration in various states as "sellers of travel" and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds. In addition, Expedia's businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility.
 As Expedia continues to expand the reach of its brands into the European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, it is increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements, mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions, industry specific value-added tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages. For example, the European Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package, including supplier failure. 
 Additionally, Expedia is subject to consumer protection, privacy and consumer data, labor, economic and trade sanction programs, tax, and anti-trust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry. For example, the European Union’s GDPR, requires companies, including Expedia and Bodybuilding, to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data. Similar laws are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions. In addition, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies, so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to Expedia's business.
 Bodybuilding
 Domestic
 The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is the regulatory agency with principal oversight authority for the products Bodybuilding offers for sale, and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulates the advertising and marketing of those products. The FDA regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”). DSHEA amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish a distinct 

 
  I-13

 
framework for the regulation of the processing, formulation, manufacturing, safety, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, and advertising of dietary supplements.
 In conjunction with the FDA, the FTC regulates the advertising and marketing of dietary supplements. The FTC’s regulations require that dietary supplement companies have adequate substantiation for any claims made in advertising, marketing, and labeling. In addition, the FTC has specific regulations addressing consumer and influencer product endorsements and reviews, which Bodybuilding’s compliance team regularly monitors, as well as regulations concerning consumer data privacy and protection. 
 Bodybuilding and its sale of dietary supplement products and digital content is also subject to various other federal and state regulatory agencies such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture, and various state and local agencies, such as California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and regulatory action by states’ attorneys general, and to non-governmental entities such as the Better Business Bureau. 
 International
 Bodybuilding’s products and digital content sold internationally are also subject to regulation under various national, local and international laws governing the sourcing, formulation, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising, and registration of its products. Foreign regulations may require product reformulation for dietary supplement products and not all ingredients are saleable worldwide. In addition, marketing, advertising, privacy rules, and content may change by country to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.  Compliance
 Bodybuilding's internal legal and compliance departments conduct comprehensive reviews of third-party products offered for sale on Bodybuilding’s website domestically and internationally. Over the years Bodybuilding has built a comprehensive product onboarding manual, which includes an ingredient restriction list and an over 100-point checklist prior to the onboarding of any new third-party products. Bodybuilding also has vendor agreements with all third-party brands which cover indemnification, minimum insurance requirements, and representations and warranties that their products comply with all applicable laws and regulations and do not contain any ingredients on Bodybuilding’s restricted ingredients list or are excluded from coverage by the third-party vendor’s product liability insurance. Each new vendor and any new product offered by an existing vendor (along with associated marketing material, such as product-page content) to be displayed on Bodybuilding’s website is reviewed by Bodybuilding’s legal and compliance departments, respectively and products, ingredients, or content that it believes pose undue risk or are otherwise materially non-compliant are rejected and/or modified. 
 Bodybuilding has established similar processes to review the underlying safety and efficacy of its “owned” brand or private label branded products, which include compliance review of the ingredients’ and formulations’ safety information, product formulation, product form, product labeling, presence of competent and reliable scientific substantiation for claims associated with the product and the product’s efficacy, as well as claims made in marketing materials. Bodybuilding's contractual relationships with its owned brand manufacturers require that all of Bodybuilding’s owned brand products not be adulterated or misbranded as defined by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, but not limited to, compliance with applicable Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”). Bodybuilding undertakes product testing using a qualified third-party laboratory and tests its owned brand products for identity, purity, quality, strength, shelf-life, and composition. All owned brand product formulations require a certificate of analysis, certifying that each ingredient on the label is present in the product and in the amount stated on the label. Bodybuilding implemented a standard quality control operating procedure that includes unannounced on-site audits of its contract manufacturers’ facilities and processes, as well as its own holding facilities. In addition, Bodybuilding enters into stand-alone quality agreements with each product manufacturer that address and allocate responsibility for all aspects of cGMP compliance, including, but not limited to, product sample retention, records retention, audit and inspection rights, subcontracting restrictions, product recalls, and product testing. Bodybuilding also has standard procedures whereby all potential contract manufacturers are reviewed and approved before they can manufacture Bodybuilding's owned brand products. In addition, all potential new products are evaluated and approved by Bodybuilding’s legal and compliance departments prior to being added to the owned brand product lines or placed into commerce.
 All consumer and marketing communications that deal with product and health issues must be approved by Bodybuilding's compliance team prior to being placed on Bodybuilding’s website, social channels, and other public-facing 

 
  I-14

 
platforms. In addition, Bodybuilding regularly monitors and communicates with its marketing affiliates (e.g., its brand athletes, affiliates, ambassadors, etc.) to ensure affiliate content is compliant with applicable marketing and advertising regulations. 
 Bodybuilding continues to dedicate resources to and has developed processes and implemented procedures designed to protect customer privacy and ensure data security and compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
 Competition
 Expedia
 Expedia's brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. Expedia believes international markets represent especially large opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale. Expedia also believes that it is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global, travel marketplace.
 Expedia's competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers, including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, large online portals and search websites, certain travel metasearch websites, mobile travel applications and social media websites, as well as traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites. Expedia faces these competitors in local, regional, national and/or international markets. In some cases, competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult. Expedia also faces competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites, which impacts its customer acquisition and marketing costs.
 Expedia believes that maintaining and enhancing its brands is a critical component of its effort to compete. Expedia differentiates its brands from its competitors primarily based on the multiple channels it uses to generate demand, quality and breadth of travel products, channel features and usability, price or promotional offers, traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice, as well as offline brand efforts. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies, depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic. Expedia's brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs, complimentary services such as Wi-Fi, and better pricing. Expedia's websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers, and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction. Expedia faces competition from airlines, hotels, alternative accommodation websites, rental car companies, cruise operators and other travel service providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of which are suppliers to its websites. Expedia's business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of new competitors or business models, and supplier consolidation.
 Bodybuilding
 Bodybuilding's performance is affected by competitive trends such as the entry of new competitors as well as competitors that have expanded their product selection to focus on sports nutrition. This includes many mass and specialty retailers, some of the largest online e-retailers, and supplement suppliers utilizing their direct to consumer channels. Additionally, changes in promotional strategies or expansion of product assortment by various competitors also impact competitive conditions. With regard to its online content subscriptions, Bodybuilding faces competition from several other offerings with similar content exclusivity. Additionally, Bodybuilding faces competition from athletes and influencers in the health and fitness related field due to the ease and distribution that social media and its online presence has created. Bodybuilding believes the following are the principal competitive factors in its market:
· | pricing (including costs of shipping), selection and availability of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reliability and speed of delivery of products ordered online;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to offer relevant, scalable, and engaging content;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | the accessibility and ease of use of website and mobile applications; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  I-15

 


· | customer service and support.

  Employees
 Expedia Holdings does not have any corporate employees. Subsequent to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) provides Expedia Holdings with certain transitional services pursuant to a services agreement, and certain of Qurate Retail and/or Liberty Media's corporate employees and executive officers provide services to Expedia Holdings. As of December 31, 2018, Expedia had approximately 24,500 full and part-time employees. As of December 31, 2018, Bodybuilding had approximately 393 full time equivalent employees and 5 part-time employees. None of Bodybuilding’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Expedia Holdings believes that these employee relations are good.
