   Item 1. Business.
   Overview
   When we formed our company, our focus was to (i) construct and/or purchase and manage a chain of combined gasoline, diesel and natural gas (NG) fueling and service stations (initially, in the Miami, FL area); (ii) construct conversion factories to convert NG to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG); and (iii) construct conversion factories to retrofit vehicles currently using gasoline or diesel fuel to also run on NG in the United States and also to build a convenience store to serve our customers in each of our locations.   On January 5, 2017, American Resources Corporation (ARC or the Company) executed a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Quest Energy Inc. (Quest Energy), a private company incorporated in the State of Indiana on May 2015 with offices at 9002 Technology Lane, Fishers, IN 46038, and due to the fulfillment of various conditions precedent to closing of the transaction, the control of the Company was transferred to the Quest Energy shareholders on February 7, 2017. This transaction resulted in Quest Energy becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARC. Through Quest Energy, ARC was able to acquire coal mining and coal processing operations, substantially all located in eastern Kentucky.    Quest Energy currently has five coal mining and processing operating subsidiaries: McCoy Elkhorn Coal LLC (doing business as McCoy Elkhorn Coal Company) (McCoy Elkhorn), Knott County Coal LLC (Knott County Coal), Deane Mining LLC (Deane Mining) and Quest Processing LLC (Quest Processing) located in eastern Kentucky within the Central Appalachian coal basin, and ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (ERC) located in southwest Indiana within the Illinois coal basin. The coal reserves under control by the Company are generally comprise of metallurgical coal (used for steel making), pulverized coal injections (used in the steel making process) and high-BTU, low sulfur, low moisture bituminous coal used for a variety of uses within several industries, including industrial customers, specialty products and thermal coal used for electricity generation.   McCoy Elkhorn Coal LLC
   Located primarily within Pike County, Kentucky, McCoy Elkhorn is currently comprised of two active mines (Mine #15 and the Carnegie Mine), two coal preparation facilities (Bevins #1 and Bevins #2), and other mines in various stages of development or reclamation. McCoy Elkhorn sells its coal to a variety of customers, both domestically and internationally, primarily to the steel making industry as a high-vol “B” coal or blended coal, and high-grade thermal coal to utilities.    Mine #15 is an underground mine in the Millard (also known as Glamorgan) coal seam and located near Meta, Kentucky. Mine #15 is mined via room-and-pillar mining methods using continuous miners, and the coal is belted directly from the stockpile to McCoy Elkhorn’s coal preparation facility. Mine #15 is currently a “company run” mine, whereby the Company manages the workforce at the mine. The coal from Mine #15 is stockpiled at the mine site and belted directly to the Company’s nearby coal preparation facilities. Production at Mine #15 re-commenced under Quest Energy’s ownership in September 2016.   The Carnegie Mine is an underground mine in the Alma and Upper Alma coal seams and located near Kimper, Kentucky. In 2011, coal production from the Carnegie Mine in the Alma coal seam commenced and then subsequently the mine was idled. Production at the Carnegie Mine was reinitiated in early 2017 under Quest Energy’s ownership and is currently being mined via room-and-pillar mining methods utilizing a continuous miner. The coal is stockpiled on-site and trucked approximately 7 miles to McCoy Elkhorn’s preparation facilities. The Carnegie Mine is currently operated as a modified contractor mine, whereby McCoy Elkhorn provides the mining infrastructure and equipment for the operations and pays the contractor a fixed per-ton fee for managing the workforce, procuring the supplies, and maintaining the equipment and infrastructure in proper working order.

    There are two coal preparation facilities at McCoy Elkhorn: the Bevins #1 Preparation Plant, an 800 ton-per hour coal preparation facility, and the Bevins #2 Preparation Plant, located on the same permit site as Bevins #1, and a 500 ton-per-hour processing facility. Both coal preparation plants have fine coal recovery and a stoker circuits for enhanced coal recovery and coal sizing options.   Both Bevins #1 and Bevins #2 have a batch-weight loadout and rail spur for loading coal into trains for rail shipments. The spur has storage for 110 rail cars and is serviced by CSX Transportation and is located on CSX’s Big Sandy, Coal Run Subdivision. Both Bevins #1 and Bevins #2 have coarse refuse and slurry impoundments called Big Groundhog and Lick Branch Impoundments.    Knott County Coal LLC
   Located primarily within Knott County, Kentucky (but with additional idled permits in Leslie County, Perry County, and Breathitt County, Kentucky), Knott County Coal is comprised of 17 idled mining permits (or permits in reclamation) and permits for two preparation facilities: the Supreme Energy Preparation Plant and the Raven Preparation Plant, both of which are also idled. The idled mining permits are either in various stages of reclamation or being maintained as idled, pending any changes to the coal market that may warrant reinitiating production. The idled mines at Knott County Coal are primarily underground mines that utilize room-and-pillar mining.   The idled Supreme Energy Preparation Plant is a 450 ton-per-hour coal preparation facility located in Kite, Kentucky. The Bates Branch rail loadout associated with the Supreme Energy Preparation Plant is a batch-weigh rail loadout with 110 rail car storage capacity and serviced by CSX Transportation in their Big Sandy rate district. The Supreme Energy Preparation Plant has a coarse refuse and slurry impoundment called the King Branch Impoundment.   Knott County Coal is also owner of the permits to the idled Raven Preparation Plant, an 800 ton-per-hour coal preparation facility with a fine coal circuit, located in Raven, Kentucky. The Raven rail loadout is a batch-weight rail loadout with 110 car storage capacity and services by CSX Transportation in their Big Sandy rate district. The Raven Preparation Plant has a coarse refuse and slurry impoundment called the Big Branch Impoundment.   Deane Mining LLC
   Located within Letcher County and Knott County, Kentucky, Deane Mining is comprised of one active underground coal mine (the Access Energy Mine), one active surface mine (Razorblade Surface) and one active coal preparation facility called Mill Creek Preparation Plant, along with 12 additional idled mining permits (or permits in reclamation). The idled mining permits are either in various stages of development, reclamation or being maintained as idled, pending any changes to the coal market that may warrant re-starting production.   Access Energy is an underground mine in the Elkhorn 3 coal seam and located in Deane, Kentucky. Access Energy is mined via room-and-pillar mining methods using continuous miners, and the coal is belted directly from the mine to the raw coal stockpile at the Mill Creek Preparation Plant across the road from Access Energy. Access Energy is currently run as a modified contractor mine, whereby Deane Mining provides the mining infrastructure and equipment for the operations and pays the contractor a fixed per-ton fee for managing the workforce, procuring the supplies, and maintaining the equipment and infrastructure in proper working order.   Razorblade Surface is a surface mine targeting the Hazard 4 and Hazard 4 Rider coal seams and located in Deane, Kentucky. Deane Mining is currently preparing Razorblade Surface for coal extraction and anticipates extracting coal in spring of 2018. Coal produced from Razorblade Surface will be trucked approximately one mile to the Mill Creek Preparation Plant.   Coal from Access Energy is processed at Deane Mining’s Mill Creek Preparation Plant, an 800 ton-per hour coal preparation facility with a batch-weight loadout and rail spur for loading coal into trains for rail shipments. The spur has storage for 110 rail cars and is serviced by CSX Transportation and is located on both CSX’s Big Sandy rate district and CSX’s Elkhorn rate district. The Mill Creek Preparation Plant has a coarse refuse and slurry impoundment called Razorblade Impoundment.

    Quest Processing LLC
   Quest Energy’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Quest Processing, manages the assets, operations, and personnel of the certain coal processing and transportation facilities of Quest Energy’s various other subsidiaries, namely the Supreme Energy Preparation Facility (of Knott County Coal LLC), the Raven Preparation Facility (of Knott County Coal LLC), and Mill Creek Preparation Facility (of Deane Mining LLC). Quest Processing LLC was the recipient of a New Markets Tax Credit loan that allowed for the payment of certain expenses of these preparation facilities. As part of that financing transaction, Quest Energy loaned ERC Mining LLC, an entity owned by members of Quest Energy, Inc.’s management, $4,120,000 to facilitate the New Markets Tax Credit loan, of which is all outstanding as of December 31, 2017. ERC Mining LLC is considered a variable interest entity and is consolidated into Quest Energy’s financial statements.   ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (the Gold Star Mine)
   Quest Energy, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (ERC), has a management agreement with an unrelated entity, LC Energy Operations LLC to manage an underground coal mine, clean coal processing facility and rail loadout located in Greene County, Indiana (referred to as the “Gold Star Mine”) for a monthly cash and per-ton fee. As part of that management agreement, ERC manages the operations of the Gold Star Mine, is the holder of the mining permit, provides the reclamation bonding, is the owner of some of the equipment located at the Gold Star Mine, and provides the employment for the personnel located at the Gold Star Mine. LC Energy Operations LLC owns the remaining equipment and infrastructure, is the lessee of the mineral (and the owner of some of the mineral and surface), and provides funding for the operations. Currently the coal mining operations at the Gold Star Mine are idled.    In addition to the current owned permits and controlled reserves, ARC may, from time to time, and frequently, acquire additional coal mining permits or reserves, or dispose of coal mining permits or reserves currently held by ARC, as management of the Company deems appropriate.   Mineral and Surface Leases
   Coal mining and processing involves the extraction of coal (mineral) and the use of surface property incidental to such extraction and processing. All of the mineral and surface related to the Company’s coal mining operations is leased from various mineral and surface owners (the “Leases”). The Company’s operating subsidiaries, collectively, are parties to approximately 200 various Leases and other agreements required for the Company’s coal mining and processing operations. The Leases are with a variety of Lessors, from individuals to professional land management firms such as the Elk Horn Coal Company LLC and Alma Land Company. In some instances, the Company has leases with Land Resources & Royalties LLC (LRR), a professional leasing firm that is an entity wholly owned by Quest MGMT LLC, an entity owned by members of Quest Energy Inc.’s management. LRR is considered a variable interest entity and is consolidated into Quest Energy’s financial statements.   Coal Sales
   ARC sells its coal to domestic and international customers, some which blend ARC’s coal at east coast ports with other qualities of coal for export. Coal sales currently come from the Company’s McCoy Elkhorn’s Mine #15, McCoy Elkhorn’s Carnegie Mine, and Deane Mining’s Access Energy Mine. The Company may, at times, purchase coal from other regional producers to sell on its contracts.   Coal sales at the Company is primarily outsource to third party intermediaries who act on the Company’s behalf to source potential coal sales and contracts. The third-party intermediaries have no ability to bind the Company to any contracts, and all coal sales are approved by management of the Company.

    Competition
   The coal industry is intensely competitive. The most important factors on which the Company competes are coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and reliability of supply. Our principal domestic competitors will include Alpha Natural Resources, Ramaco Resources, Blackhawk Mining, Coronado Coal, Arch Coal, Contura Energy, Warrior Met Coal, Alliance Resource Partners, and ERP Compliance Fuels. Many of these coal producers may have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do. We also compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries, such as Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa.   Legal Proceedings
   From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to, and our property is not subject to, any material legal proceedings.   Environmental, Governmental, and Other Regulatory Matters
   Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to matters such as permitting and licensing, employee health and safety, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, remediation of contaminants, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions. In addition, we may become subject to additional costs for benefits for current and retired coal miners. These environmental laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) with respect to coal mining activities and ancillary activities; the Clean Air Act (CAA) with respect to air emissions; the Clean Water Act (CWA) with respect to water discharges and the permitting of key operational infrastructure such as impoundments; Resource Conservation and Recovery RCRA with respect to solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, as well as the regulation of underground storage tanks; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) with respect to releases, threatened releases and remediation of hazardous substances; the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) with respect to threatened and endangered species; and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to the evaluation of environmental impacts related to any federally issued permit or license. Many of these federal laws have state and local counterparts which also impose requirements and potential liability on our operations.   Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement, continuation or expansion of exploration or production at our facilities. They may also depress demand for our products by imposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly complex and stringent over time. These laws and regulations, particularly new legislative or administrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs. Individually and collectively, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operations directly and/or indirectly, through our customers’ inability to use our products.   Certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws are undergoing revision or have not yet been promulgated. As a result, we cannot always determine the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations.   Due in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of these requirements, violations of these laws can occur from time to time in our industry and also in our operations. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and compliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term environmental liabilities. To the extent that these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be reduced.   In addition, our customers are subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impacts associated with the combustion or other use of coal, which may affect demand for our coal. Changes in applicable laws or the adoption of new laws relating to energy production, greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions from use of coal products may cause coal to become a less attractive source of energy, which may adversely affect our mining operations, the cost structure and, the demand for coal.

    We believe that our competitors with operations in the United States are confronted by substantially similar conditions. However, foreign producers and operators may not be subject to similar requirements and may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in or be subject to similar limitations on their operations. As a result, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with United States environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to those foreign competitors. The specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, applicable legislation and its production methods.   The Mine Act and the MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been adopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.   Due to the large number of mining permits held by the Company that have been previously mined and operated, there is a significant amount of environmental reclamation and remediation required by the Company to comply with local, state, and federal regulations for coal mining companies.    Property
   Our principal offices are located at 9002 Technology Lane, Fishers, Indiana 46038. We pay $2,500 per month in rent for the office space and the rental lease expires in December 2018. We also rent office space from an entity which we consolidate as a variable interest entity (see note 5) at 11000 Highway 7 South, Kite, Kentucky 41828 and pay $500 per month rent and the rental lease expires October 30, 2021.   The Company also utilizes various office spaces on-site at its coal mining operations and coal preparation plant locations in eastern Kentucky, with such rental payments covered under any surface lease contracts with any of the surface land owners.   Employees
   ARC, through its operating subsidiaries, employs a combination of company employees and contract labor to mine coal, process coal, and related functions. The Company is continually evaluating the use of company employees and contract labor to determine the optimal mix of each, given the needs of the Company. Currently, McCoy Elkhorn’s Mine #15 and Deane Mining’s Razorblade Surface mine are primarily run by company employees, McCoy Elkhorn’s Carnegie Mine and Deane Mining’s Access Energy mine are primarily run by contract labor, and the Company’s various coal preparation facilities are run by company employees.    The Company currently has approximately 204 employees, with a substantial majority based in eastern Kentucky. The Company is headquartered in Fishers, Indiana with six members of the Company’s executive team based at this location.

    Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
   We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:    
· | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
· | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and 
· | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 


We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).   In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.    We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.   We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.
