Item 1. Business. 
 References herein to “the Company”, “Alta”, “we”, “our” or “us” mean Alta Equipment Group Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 Overview
 We own and operate one of the largest integrated equipment dealership platforms in the United States (“U.S.”). Through our branch network, we sell, rent, and provide parts and service support for several categories of specialized equipment, including lift trucks, heavy and compact earthmoving equipment and other material handling and construction equipment. We engage in five principal business activities in these equipment categories:

(i) | new equipment sales;
----+---------------------


(ii) | used equipment sales;
-----+----------------------


(iii) | parts sales;
------+-------------


(iv) | repair and maintenance services; and
-----+-------------------------------------


(v) | equipment rentals.
----+-------------------

 We have operated as an equipment dealership for over 37 years and have developed a branch network that includes 64 total locations in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Virginia and Florida. We offer our customers a one-stop-shop for most of their equipment needs by providing sales, parts, service, and rental functions under one roof. More recently, with the acquisitions of PeakLogix, Inc. (“PeakLogix”) in June 2020 and ScottTech, LLC (“ScottTech”) in March 2021, we have entered the automated equipment installation and system integration sector, which we believe has natural synergies with our material handling business and positions us to take advantage of the macroeconomic trend in e-commerce and logistics.
 Within our territories, we are the exclusive distributor of new equipment and replacement parts on behalf of our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) partners. We and our regional subsidiaries enjoy long-standing relationships with leading material handling and construction equipment OEMs, including Hyster-Yale, Volvo, and JCB, among more than 30 others. We are consistently recognized by OEMs as a top dealership partner and have been identified as a nationally recognized Hyster-Yale dealer and multi-year recipient of the Volvo Dealer of the Year award. In August 2021 the Company entered into a dealer agreement with Nikola Corporation to become the authorized dealer to sell and service Nikola medium and long-haul class 8 electric vehicle trucks in the New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and New England markets.
 We are committed to providing our customers with a best-in-class equipment dealership experience. Our customers are principally focused on equipment reliability and up-time, and our teams of skilled technicians and commitment to service are key to establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships, representing a critical competitive advantage. Parts and service are also our most predictable and profitable businesses, with the dealership model structured to drive aftermarket parts and service revenue. Through our new and used equipment sales and our sale of lightly used rental fleet, we populate our exclusive territories with serviceable equipment. As the field population ages, we capitalize on aftermarket parts and service sales through the equipment maintenance cycle.
 We have experienced significant organic and acquisition-led growth since 2008, completing over 25 acquisitions in that timeframe. We expect that acquisition activity to continue, as OEM partners support us as a consolidator by granting us new exclusive territories or by consenting to our acquisition of existing dealers. 
 Concurrently with the closing of the business combination on February 14, 2020, we consummated the acquisition of each of Liftech Equipment Companies, Inc. (“Liftech”) and FlaglerCE Holdings, LLC (“Flagler”). Liftech was the Hyster-Yale and JCB dealer in Upstate New York and Vermont, and Flagler was the Volvo dealer in Florida and portions of Georgia. After the closing of the business combination in 2020, we have consummated acquisitions of PeakLogix a national material handling systems integrator, Hilo Equipment and Services (“Hilo”) the exclusive Hyster-Yale dealer in New York City, Martin Implement Sales, Inc. (“Martin”) a premium equipment distributor in the Chicago metropolitan area, Howell Tractor and Equipment, LLC (“Howell Tractor”) a heavy equipment dealer serving Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana and Vantage Equipment, LLC (“Vantage”) the Volvo dealer operating in the geographic area of Upstate New York. In 2021, we completed acquisitions of ScottTech, expanding on our warehouse design, automated equipment installation and system integration, Baron Industries (“Baron”) a dock & door business in the northeast which builds out our full-service warehousing and logistics offerings within the material handling segment, Gibson Machinery, LLC (“Gibson”) a premium equipment distributor expanding our construction equipment footprint to Ohio and OEM relationships, Midwest Mine Services, LLC (“Midwest Mine”) an installer of full aggregate processing plants for quarries, mines and recycling 
 2

operations primarily in Michigan and Ohio markets, Ginop Sales, Inc. (“Ginop”) which expands our Kubota construction and agricultural offerings in Northern Michigan, and Ambrose Equipment, LLC (“Ambrose”) a premium asphalt equipment dealer in the northeast.
 Products and Services
 New Equipment Sales. We sell new material handling and construction equipment and are a leading dealer for over 30 nationally recognized OEMs. Our new equipment sales generate customers for our parts sales and service operations, which grow with an expanding equipment field population in our territories. Additionally, with our recent acquisitions of PeakLogix and ScottTech, we provide warehouse design and build, automated equipment installation and system integration solutions.
 Used Equipment Sales. We sell used equipment, primarily from equipment trade-ins from our new and returning customers. Used equipment sales, like new equipment sales, generate parts and services business for us.
 Parts Sales. We are the exclusive distributor of OEM parts in substantially all of our territories. Our in-house parts inventory is extensive, enabling us to provide timely service support to our customers.
 Service Support. We provide maintenance and repair services for our customers’ equipment and maintain our own rental fleet. In addition to repair and maintenance on an as needed or scheduled basis, we provide ongoing maintenance services and warranty repairs for our customers. We have committed substantial resources to recruiting and retaining skilled technicians, including partnerships with technical and trade schools near each of our branch locations. We believe that our service capabilities differentiate us from our competitors.
 Equipment Rentals. We rent material handling and construction equipment to our customers. We view our rental fleet as an important component of our one-stop-shop model, and customers rely on our rental equipment when flexing up their fleet capacity for a project or when customer-owned equipment is being serviced. Our rental business also supports our rent-to-sell strategy, in which we sell equipment from our rental fleet to customers who prefer to purchase lightly used equipment. As with new and used equipment sales, the rent-to-sell solution generates parts and service revenue as equipment is sold into our territories.
Industry Background
 The industry for material handling and construction equipment is driven by a broad range of economic factors and trends, including the ongoing transition of consumer preferences toward online retail and the associated warehousing and logistics requirements, residential, non-residential and infrastructure related construction trends, manufacturing and distribution, and general construction and material handling machinery demand. In addition, regional factors have an impact, particularly where equipment dealerships have territorial exclusivity with OEM partners.
 As a one-stop-shop equipment dealership platform, we sell, rent, and provide parts and services support. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage over our single channel competitors and traditional equipment rental houses, which may have difficulty expanding due to the infrastructure, training, and relationships necessary to support a growing population of equipment in a designated territory and that typically have limited parts and service offerings.
 OEMs have pushed for consolidation in their dealership networks, and we believe that we are one of the few natural consolidators in our industry. We are one of a very limited number of public equipment dealerships, and we believe that our public profile will be a significant advantage when sourcing and competing for acquisition targets. Furthermore, many equipment dealerships are family-owned operations, and retiring management teams have struggled to develop succession plans. We are a recognized consolidator in the industry, and many incumbent dealership owners have approached our management about potential sale transactions as a result. We believe that these dynamics will contribute to a steady acquisition pipeline at attractive valuation levels.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following attributes are important to our ability to compete effectively and to achieve our financial objectives:
 Integrated Dealership Platform Providing Full Scale Solutions to Customers. Our integrated equipment sales, service, and rental platform provide a one-stop-shop for a highly diverse group of customers, enabling us to profitably grow our revenue throughout the years. With our over 60 dealership locations, we believe that our scale will help us be the leading provider of material handling and construction equipment and aftermarket parts and service support in each of our territories.
 3

Superior Parts and Services Operations Supporting Customer Relationships. We provide parts and service to our customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Our parts and service capabilities support customers in maximizing equipment uptime, which we believe is a key consideration when an equipment customer is making a selection among competing product offerings. The aftermarket parts and service businesses provide us with a predictable, high-margin revenue source that is relatively insulated from the typical business cycle.
 Ability to Attract and Retain Skilled Technical Employees. We believe that we provide best-in-class parts and service support to our customers, and the ability to attract and retain skilled technicians is critical to aftermarket performance. We have partnered with trade and technical schools near many of our branches, and these relationships, along with our recruiting prowess, provide us with a pipeline of skilled employees. To retain employees, we offer attractive benefits, clean facilities with the most advanced diagnostic software, modern tools, and OEM parts. Above all, we view our technicians as key contributors to future success, and we accord respect to our skilled technicians.
 Leading Dealer for Equipment Manufacturers. We are a leading U.S. dealer for over 30 nationally recognized material handling and heavy construction OEMs, including Hyster-Yale, Volvo, and JCB. Our primary dealer agreements grant us exclusivity for new equipment, replacement part sales, and diagnostic service software in our territories. The OEM relationships also promote our acquisition strategy, as the OEMs prefer to partner with fewer, financially stronger dealerships and view us as a prominent consolidator.
 High-Quality Rental Fleet for Rent-to-Sell and Rent-to-Rent Programs. Equipment rental is complementary to our new and used equipment sales and is an important component of our one-stop-shop model. Rental operations are fully aligned with our dealership strategy, as the rent-to-sell solution provides an additional sales channel by which we are able to populate our territories with equipment and generate high-margin parts and service revenue. In addition, our existing equipment customers rely on our rental fleet when facing short-term equipment needs and when customer equipment is being serviced.
 Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is led by Chief Executive Officer Ryan Greenawalt and Chief Financial Officer Anthony Colucci, each of whom has substantial experience in the equipment distribution industry. Our senior leadership is well known and highly respected in the industry. Industry relationships provide a meaningful portion of our acquisition pipeline, as dealership owners frequently approach our management team to discuss a sale to us. Additionally, our senior leadership team is experienced in managing our business throughout the business cycle, which has been critical in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic.
Business Strategy
 We employ the following business strategies:
 Leverage the Field Population of Equipment in Our Territories to Grow Parts and Service Revenue. We actively populate our territories with new and used equipment, which generates predictable, high-margin parts and service revenue. For example, we followed the strategy developed in Michigan when we expanded into the Chicago and Florida construction equipment market in 2018 and 2020, respectively, growing the field population of equipment through our new, used, and rent-to-sell sales channels upon market entry. As a result, we expect future benefits from increasing aftermarket parts and service revenue driven by the equipment maintenance cycle.
 Recruit Skilled Technicians to Expand the Parts and Service Operations. We depend on our teams of technicians to provide customers with best-in-class parts and service support, and we have developed a multifaceted strategy to recruit skilled mechanics. Critically, our partnerships with technical schools and community colleges provide consistent access to new technicians. For example, we provide floor space at our Detroit location to the Detroit Training Center, a vocational school for skilled trades. In addition, we regularly hire mechanics away from independent rental or service businesses in our markets, where a lack of access to OEM parts and diagnostic tools make servicing increasingly sophisticated equipment difficult. Additionally, we have been successful in hiring skilled technicians from other industries, such as the automotive industry. We intend to replicate this strategy as we acquire additional dealership territories.
 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our management team has successfully completed over 25 acquisitions. We have two primary areas of focus when pursuing acquisitions:
  
• | Territory In-Fill. Within our existing territories, we pursue acquisitions that provide new customer relationships and pools of skilled technicians, such as regional rental houses or independent service businesses. These acquisitions advance the parts and service strategy by simultaneously increasing the field population within the existing territory and expanding the number of skilled technicians to generate predictable, high-margin service and parts revenue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4

 
• | Territorial Expansion. Our geographic footprint has grown through acquisition, from our original Michigan lift truck territory to a leading equipment dealer in the Midwest, New York, New England and Florida. In selecting additional territories for acquisition, we prioritize geographically contiguous markets that can be improved by our systems and processes and/or markets with a high density of equipment users.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pursue Synergistic Verticals. With our existing expertise in sales and service of electro-mobility, we pursue strategic opportunities to leverage our knowledge to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles and deliver world-class service to electric vehicle customers within our existing territories.
History
 Through our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment sales, service, and rental business for approximately 37 years. Alta Holdings was formed in 1984 as Yale Materials Handling-Michigan, Inc. and was solely a material handling forklift distributor. We were originally owned and operated by Steven Greenawalt, current Chief Executive Officer Ryan Greenawalt’s father. Ryan Greenawalt returned to the Company in a senior management capacity in 2008, following professional experience in financial services. Under Ryan Greenawalt’s leadership, we broadened our material handling offering, expanded into construction equipment distribution, and launched an acquisition strategy that has resulted in over 25 successful transactions. In 2017, Ryan Greenawalt executed a buy-out of his father and other family members, becoming the Company’s sole owner.
 On February 14, 2020, Alta Equipment Group Inc. (formerly known as B. Riley Principal Merger Corp.), consummated a reverse recapitalization pursuant to which the Company acquired all of Alta Equipment Holdings, Inc. (“Alta Holdings”), pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger between the Company, BR Canyon Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Alta Holdings and Ryan Greenawalt. 
 Upon the consummation of the business combination, Merger Sub merged with and into Alta Holdings, with Alta Holdings surviving the reverse recapitalization as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company changed its name from B. Riley Principal Merger Corp. to Alta Equipment Group Inc.
 Prior to the business combination, our business was conducted through Alta Enterprises, LLC, and its operating subsidiaries. Today, Alta Enterprises, LLC is a subsidiary of Alta Holdings.
 On May 1, 2019, we acquired the assets and business of NITCO. NITCO brought us into the material handling and construction equipment market in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island. Our NITCO business unit’s primary OEM partners are Hyster-Yale for material handling equipment and JCB for construction equipment. NITCO has provided the platform for continued expansion, particularly in material handling in the Northeast.
 During 2020, our acquisitions of Liftech and Flagler enhanced our presence in Upstate New York, Vermont, and Florida. With the acquisition of PeakLogix, we entered the warehouse design, automated equipment installation and system integration sector, which is consistent with the growth strategy in our material handling segment and expands our geographic footprint. Our acquisition of Hilo aligns with our growth strategy by expanding our distribution footprint and presence in the New York City area which gives us a major market foothold and strengthens our overall coverage of the northeastern United States. The acquisition of Martin Implement added an exceptional compact equipment distributor and enhances our growth in the Illinois construction market and broadens our product portfolio and service capabilities. With the acquisition of Howell Tractor, we expanded our presence in the Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana markets adding a best-in-class product to our portfolio and additional service offerings. Our acquisition of Vantage further expanded our geographic footprint with Volvo in Upstate New York.
 During 2021, our acquisition of ScottTech expanded our warehouse design, automated equipment installation and system integration capabilities in our material handling segment. Our acquisition of Baron expands our commercial overhead loading dock doors and equipment in New England and is another step in the Company’s strategy to build out a full-service warehousing and logistics offering within the material handling segment. The acquisition of Gibson added a premium equipment distributor in our construction segment and expanded our footprint and presence into Ohio. The Midwest Mine acquisition expands our engineering and design services in the aggregate processing industry and strengthens our presence in the Michigan and Ohio markets in the construction equipment segment. The Ginop acquisition expands our relationship and product offerings with Kubota and strengthens our construction and agricultural equipment offerings in Northern Michigan. The acquisition of Ambrose enhances our road construction equipment product and services portfolio in the New England region.
 Customers
 We serve customers in our territories in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Florida, Georgia, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Our primary customer end markets include diversified manufacturing, food and beverage, wholesale/retail, construction, automotive, municipal/government, and medical. Our customers vary from small, single machine owners to large construction contractors and leading multi-national commercial companies. In 2021, 
 5

no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our total revenues. Our top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenues in 2021.
Floorplan Financing
 New equipment inventory is primarily financed with OEM floorplan facilities with an initial promotional period that is either subsidized or interest-free. OEMs provide this financing to enable dealers to carry equipment in anticipation of customer orders and to increase market share. In many cases we sell the equipment financed by its floorplan facilities before the expiration of the promotional interest period. We view floorplan financing on new equipment inventory that is less than a year old as a component of our working capital, and do not consider floorplan financing on new equipment as part of our corporate indebtedness.
Sales and Marketing
 We have two distinct sales forces aligned around equipment type: material handling and construction. We believe maintaining separate sales forces for equipment allows our sales teams to effectively meet the demands of different types of customers while understanding sales strategies tailored to the equipment type. We have commission-based compensation programs for our sales forces.
 We provide extensive training, including frequent factory and in-house training by OEM representatives regarding the operational features of our equipment to further develop our sales team’s knowledge and experience. This training is essential, as our sales personnel regularly call on customers’ job sites and facilities, often assisting customers in assessing their immediate and ongoing equipment needs.
 We utilize a customized Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) tool, called e-Emphasys, which provides sophisticated customer relationship management functionality. e-Emphasys was designed for heavy equipment dealerships and was expanded to include our broad product portfolio, including material handling. We believe that this comprehensive customer and sales tool enhances our territory management by increasing the productivity of our sales teams and by tracking equipment service history to advance our customer support goals.
 While our specialized, well-trained sales force strengthens our customer relationships and fosters customer loyalty, we also promote our business through marketing and advertising, including industry publications, digital marketing, direct mail campaigns, television and radio and our website at www.altaequipment.com. The information contained on such websites is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual report on Form 10-K or any other public filing made with the SEC.
 Suppliers
 We purchase a significant amount of equipment and parts from over 30 manufacturers with whom we have distribution agreements. We purchased approximately 35% of our new equipment, rental fleet, and replacement parts from two major OEMs (Hyster-Yale and Volvo) during the year ended December 31, 2021. Notably, we are the exclusive OEM replacement part distributor in substantially all of our territories, allowing us to provide superior service support to our customers from an aftermarket perspective.
Information Technology Systems
 Among other metrics, our information systems track rental inventory and labor utilization statistics, and detailed operational and financial information. Our integrated services platform enables us to closely monitor our performance and our business. Our point-of-sale system enables us to link all of our facilities, permitting universal access to real-time data concerning equipment located at the individual facility locations and the rental status and maintenance history for each piece of equipment. Our business system is a full suite of highly integrated software solutions intended to manage equipment dealership activities at all essential levels. Real-time data and analytics provide detailed visibility to information across all functional areas, promoting proactive, data-driven decisions. Over 75 points of integration with our OEMs have been implemented which have greatly streamlined activities in the areas of parts inventory management and pricing, warranty claims handling, accounts payable automation, and supporting commercial credit accounts. Additional operational efficiencies are gained through our use of integrated solutions such as electronic document management, service scheduling and technician dispatch, mobile field service, and mobile equipment inspection. Analytics are provided through a data warehouse which is tightly integrated with the business system, providing real-time reports and KPI dashboards that are tailored to meet the specific needs of each department and region.
 Our customer relationship management system provides sales and customer information, available rental fleet and inventory information, a quote system and other organizational tools to assist our sales forces. We maintain an extensive customer database which allows us to monitor the status and maintenance history of our customers’ owned equipment and enables us to more effectively 
 6

provide parts and services to meet their needs. Our critical systems run on servers and other equipment that is current technology and is readily available from reputable suppliers and serviceable through existing maintenance agreements.
 Product Warranties
 Product warranties for new equipment and parts are provided by our OEM partners. The term and scope of these warranties vary greatly by supplier and by product. The OEMs pay us for repairs we perform on equipment under warranty in our territories.
Seasonality
 The demand for our construction equipment tends to be lower in the winter months, and equipment rental performance will generally correlate to the levels of current construction activities, so the severity of weather conditions can have an impact on our business, especially in our Northern territories.
 Parts and services activities are less affected by changes in demand caused by seasonality, especially in our material handling segment, and are highly predictable based on historical maintenance and service trends as equipment ages.
 Competition
 The material handling and construction equipment sales and distribution industry is competitive and remains fragmented, with large numbers of competitors operating on a regional or local scale. Within our territories, our competitors range from multi-location, regional operators to single-location dealers of competing equipment brands. We compete with other equipment dealers that sell other brands of equipment that we do not represent or that we do not represent in a particular market. We also compete with local and nationwide rental businesses in certain product categories.
 Competition among equipment dealers, whether they offer material handling or construction equipment or both, is primarily based on customer service, including repair and maintenance service provided by the dealer, reputation of the OEM and dealer, quality and design of the products, and price. In our experience, reliability and up-time are the key considerations for customers in selecting a material handling and construction equipment dealer, and we believe that our focus on parts and service support has helped us win and maintain customer business. In contrast, price is not typically a customer’s key point of differentiation in selecting among competing equipment, as OEM partners often provide pricing flexibility and discounting in order to drive market share.
 Within substantially all of our territories, we are the exclusive distributor of new equipment and replacement parts on behalf of our OEM partners. This exclusivity affords us effectively no competition from others when selling these brands in our territories. We and our regional subsidiaries enjoy long-standing relationships with the leading material handling and construction equipment OEMs, including Hyster-Yale, Volvo, and JCB, among more than 30 others. We are consistently recognized by OEMs as a top dealership partner and have been identified as a nationally recognized Hyster-Yale dealer and multi-year recipient of the Volvo Dealer of the Year award.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
 Our facilities and operations are subject to various, comprehensive, and frequently changing federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. These requirements govern, among other things, the handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and, if any, the associated cleanup of properties affected by discharges, releases, or exposure to pollutants, air quality (emissions) and wastewater, as well as the protection of human health and safety. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or competitive position as a result of our compliance with such requirements. We will continue to take necessary steps to comply with environmental requirements, but we do not expect to incur material capital or other expenditures for environmental controls or compliance.
 In the future, federal, state, or local governments could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters or effect a change in their enforcement of existing laws or regulations, that could affect our operations. There can be no assurance that we, or various environmental regulatory agencies, will not discover previously unknown environmental non-compliance or contamination, for which we could be held liable. It is possible that changes in environmental and worker health and safety laws or liabilities from newly discovered non-compliance or contamination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Human Capital
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,250 employees. Of these employees, approximately 1,000 are skilled technicians paid on an hourly basis and the remainder are hourly and salaried corporate, sales, operating, and administrative personnel. A collective bargaining agreement relating to 24 of our locations covers approximately 475 of our employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment and have instituted various initiatives to increase our diversity as it relates to recruiting and training opportunities.
 Generally, the total number of employees does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity may increase the number of our employees. Fluctuations in the level of our business activity could require some staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand. 
 Health and Safety
 The health and safety of our employees is an important focus at Alta. As part of our continuing goal to reduce our recordable injuries, we are committed to regularly reinforcing the importance of our safety programs and encouraging a culture of safe work practices in all of our locations. As part of our evaluation of our management employees, we evaluate the safety records of the employees for whom they have management responsibility. 
 COVID-19 reinforced the importance of a safe and healthy workforce, and in response to the pandemic, the Company implemented safeguards to protect our employees, including increased intensity of cleaning and disinfecting, social distancing practices, face coverings, temperature screening and other measures consistent with specific regulatory requirements and guidance from health authorities. We also instituted travel restrictions and remote work-from-home protocols for our employees who were not required to be on-site or at a customer site to perform their respective work functions.
  In late March 2020, in compliance with the directives of government authorities in the state and local geographic areas in which we have operations, we adjusted our operations to permit virtually all of our sales and back-office employees to work remotely. Late in the second quarter of 2020, we began phasing in a return to more normalized working conditions as state and local governments began lifting restrictions. Despite the lifting of certain restrictions, Alta continues to adhere to government issued guidelines and promote a clean and safe environment in all of its branch locations. As circumstances warrant, certain non-revenue producing business functions have continued to work via remote or hybrid work arrangements which have been designed to allow for the continued operation of our business while allowing employees to work virtually.
 Talent Development and Employee Training
 Our goal is to attract, develop and retain a talented and high-performing workforce. We are committed to our employees and their development; and we strive to create opportunities for the continual professional development of our employee base. These opportunities include continuing education and specialty training.
Compensation and Benefits
 We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees, as we believe competitive compensation arrangements are core to an engaged and productive employee base. We believe our compensation programs align both individual and team contributions to promoting our culture and driving our performance. 
 Legal Proceedings
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
 Available Information
 We electronically file annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements and other reports and information statements with the SEC. We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as well as our other SEC filings, available on our website, www.investors.altaequipment.com, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC and the address of that site is http://www.sec.gov.

Our principal executive offices are located at 13211 Merriman Road, Livonia, Michigan 48150, and our telephone number is (248) 449-6700. We also make available on our website copies of materials regarding our corporate governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines; our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and the charters relating to the committees of our Board of Directors.
 Emerging Growth Company
 Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. The Company lost its Emerging Growth Company status as of December 31, 2021 as we achieved $1.2 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
