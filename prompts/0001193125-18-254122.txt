 Introduction 
 Schmitt Industries, Inc. (the Company), an Oregon corporation, designs, manufactures and sells high precision test and measurement products for two main business segments: the Balancer segment and the Measurement segment. For the Balancer segment, the Company designs, manufactures and sells computer-controlled vibration detection, balancing and process control systems for the worldwide machine tool industry, particularly for grinding machines. The Company also provides sales and service for Europe and Asia through its wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Europe Limited (SEL), located in Coventry, England and through its sales representative office located in Shanghai, China. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation, the Company designs, manufactures and sells laser and white light sensors for distance, dimensional and area measurement for a wide variety of commercial applications and ultrasonic measurement products that accurately measure the fill levels of tanks holding propane, diesel and other tank-based liquids and transmit that data via satellite to a secure web site for display (the Measurement segment). The Companys corporate office is located at 2765 N.W. Nicolai Street, Portland, Oregon. The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, in 1984 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Oregon in 1995. 
 SBS, Acuity, Xact, SMS, Lasercheck and AccuProfile are registered trademarks owned by the Company. 
 Balancer Segment 
 The Companys principal product line for the Balancer segment is the Schmitt Dynamic Balance System (SBS), which consists of a vibration sensor, a computer control unit, and a balance head that is placed either externally on the grinding wheel spindle with the use of a spindle mounted adaptor or internally inside the spindle bore. SBS products are designed as economical yet highly precise measurement and control devices for permanent or portable installation on grinding machines that can detect and correct imbalance caused by vibration as small as 
Page 2 


  0.02 microns. Customers can also detect and analyze the acoustic emission (AE) signal generated during grinding or wheel dressing to help monitor and improve the grinding process. Customers include both end user operators as well as manufacturers of grinding machines worldwide for a wide variety of industries that utilize the grinding process, including the automotive, industrial, aerospace, and medical industries where specifications and operating tolerances on machined parts are increasingly precise. The following products are currently offered under the SBS brand: 
 SB-5500 Products  The SB-5500 product line is fully automated, reducing machine setup time and ensuring a smoother and more efficient grinding process. Operating on a principle of mass compensation for wheel imbalance, the balance head contains two movable eccentric weights, each driven by electric motors through a precision gear train. These weights are repositioned to offset any imbalance in a grinding wheel or other application. Imbalance or vibration is picked up by the vibration sensor and the control unit filters the signal by revolutions per minute. The control then automatically drives the balance head weights in a direction that reduces the amplitude of the vibration signal. The balance cycle is complete when the weights are positioned to achieve the lowest vibration level, as low as 0.02 microns. 
 The SB-5500 control panel contains up to four slots for additional, optional circuit boards designed for specific functions, such as manual balancing, balancing using hydro chambers and process monitoring, which involves the detection and analysis of high frequency noise, known as AE, generated by the grinding process. 
 The optional Acoustic Emission Monitoring System (AEMS) control card uses proprietary acoustic sensor technology to monitor the AE signal generated on the grinding machine during key events in the grinding process. The AEMS card allows rapid, automatic grinding wheel in-feed, right up to the point of initial contact of the grinding wheel with a new part loaded in the machine. The system can automatically detect the initial contact and very quickly report this event to the machine control, stopping the wheel in-feed without operator intervention. Part crash occurs when a part or fixture is incorrectly loaded into a grinding machine or some abnormal condition occurs. Rapid in-feed of the wheel may then result in a dangerous or expensive crash. The AEMS card allows the grinding machines operating system (known as a computer numeric control or CNC system) on the machine to monitor the acoustic levels and detect any unexpected contact when it happens. The system then reports that abnormal contact and instructs the CNC program to stop the grinding process, within milliseconds. 
 The SB-5500 also offers integration of the ExactControl card, providing enhanced control of the grinding process. The ExactControl process control card offers multi-functional grinding process control capability by detecting and analyzing either the AE signal pattern or the machine power fluctuations and then using one of seven process control strategies to adjust and optimize the grinding process based on that signal data, resulting in improved part quality and reduced operating costs. Software control strategies include ExactDisplay (graphically displays the measurement signal), ExactGap (displays and evaluates the measurement signal against a predetermined signal threshold to automatically determine when the grinding wheel touches the work piece and to shorten the time between grinding work pieces), ExactTime (displays and evaluates the time interval of a measurement signal that is above a predetermined signal threshold to monitor the minimum or maximum processing time, ExactIntegral (displays and evaluates the area under a measurement signal curve to optimize the grinding process for the particular work piece), and ExactDress (displays and evaluates the measurement signal and compares it to a standard threshold to optimize the grinding wheel dress process). 
 SB-2000 and AE-1000 Products  Additional SBS products include the SB-2000 and the AE-1000. The SB-2000 is an easy-to-use, compact manual balancing system offering both one and two plane manual balancing capabilities. The system comes in a dedicated machine installation version (SB-2000) and a portable version (SB-2000-P). Each version of the system displays up to four digits of resolution for vibration and six digits for RPM readings and supports a spindle speed range of 30 to 100,000 RPM. The portable SB-2000-P version attaches magnetically to any location on the machine for easy setup and use. The AE-1000 is a dedicated AE control platform that reduces air machine grinding time and alerts the

  operator to potential grinding wheel crash conditions by using proprietary AE detection technology to monitor the high frequency signals generated by the grinding process. 
 Notable features of the SBS system include its ability to fit almost all grinding machines, ease of installation, compact and modular construction, ability to balance a wheel while on a machine, virtual elimination of wheel vibration, automatic monitoring of balancing, display in a variety of languages and in metric units of measurement, instrument grade calibration, short balance process, measurement of both displacement and/or velocity and minimal operator maintenance. The SB-5500 also offers the capability of fully integrating its operation and output within any grinding machines CNC operating system by the use of its IVIS (Intelligent Visualization) software. 
 Benefits of using the SBS system include improved quality of finished parts, elimination of grinding gap time in the grind cycle resulting in increased efficiency and part throughput, ease of product adaptation, monitoring and correction of part crash, minimal downtime, complete and ready installation, elimination of static balancing, longer life of the grinding wheel, diamond dressings and spindle bearings, the ability to balance within 0.02 microns and its adaptability to all types of machines.

Xact Remote Tank Monitoring Products 
 The Companys Xact Remote Tank Monitoring products provide remote fill level monitoring of propane, diesel and other tank-based liquids for tanks, large or small, anywhere in the world. Accessing accurate fill level information is essential to effectively manage inventory, improve delivery efficiency, reduce operating costs and increase profitability, and justify capital expenditures. The Xact system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor that is applied externally to the tank to calculate the fill level inside the tank with great accuracy (+/- 2% for large tanks, +/-1% for small tanks). The Xact system can also be installed to measure the fill levels of bobtail and transport trucks. For smaller tanks that are difficult to access or where the precise accuracy provided by the ultrasonic sensor is not as important, Xact also offers a sensor that is affixed to the dial of a preinstalled float gauge (known as a gauge reader) which detects the fill level that is reported by the gauge. Float gauges have a typical 
Page 6 


  accuracy of +/- 8% to 12%. Tank fill data is then transmitted via the Globalstar® satellite network to a secure website for display. There is no reliance on phone land lines or cellular networks and therefore no dropped data. The use of satellite telemetry permits monitoring of any tank anywhere in the world. With the Xact system, minimum or maximum alarm or fill levels can be set to automatically notify operators by email anytime a particular tank reading exceeds thresholds or needs refilling. The Xact system can be used to monitor tanks as small as 125 gallons (473 liters) and as large as 90,000 gallons (340,686 liters). With Xact, operators can obtain timely and accurate readings of inventory levels and tank refill requirements on a predetermined timely basis. 
 There are three main components to the Xact Tank Monitoring System: 
 Tank Sensor  The Xact ultrasonic sensor incorporates patented technology and is externally mounted to the bottom of the tank. The sensor produces a small electrical pulse, or a ping, that travels through the tanks steel shell, which is reflected off the bottom surface of the liquid stored in the tank in the form of an echo that is detected by the sensor. The time of flight between the ping and the echo, which is measured in milliseconds, is then calculated to determine, based upon additional data regarding tank size and shape, the volume of liquid the tank contains. This information is then remotely transmitted via a satellite radio transmitter. For smaller tanks that are difficult to access or where the precise accuracy provided by the ultrasonic sensor is not as important, Xact also offers a sensor that is affixed to the dial of a preinstalled float gauge (known as a gauge reader). The gauge reader detects the fill level that is reported by the gauge and transmits that data by satellite in the same manner as the ultrasonic sensor. Float gauges have a typical accuracy range of +/- 8% to 12%. 
 Satellite Radio Transmitter  The Xact radio transmitter is placed on the top of the tank and is connected by cable to the tank sensor or gauge reader. The satellite transmitter transmits the tank data using the GlobalStar® satellite network to a GlobalStar® ground station and then to the Xact secure website where the tank data is displayed or is automatically directed to a customers automated inventory or delivery management system. 
 Xact Website  The Xact website is a secured location providing controlled access to the tank data for each customers various tank locations. The tank fill level data and geometry of the tank are used to calculate and display the precise fill level at predetermined measurement times along with additional information such as temperature, battery status, GPS coordinates and map location, fill levels that trigger email notification and the list of email recipients. In addition to the data being displayed on the website, the data can also be automatically directed to a customers automated inventory or delivery management system for full automation of the delivery process. Operators can now obtain highly accurate readings and tank information from even the most remote tanks conveniently and cost-effectively using their desktop computer, laptop, tablet or smart phone. 
 The benefits of using the Xact Tank Monitoring System include external mounting with no reliance on existing mechanical gauges when using the ultrasonic sensors, tank fill data is sent directly and instantly from the tank to the user via satellite, no reliance on telephone lines or cellular networks and no dropped data, temperature adjusted readings for accuracy within +/- 2% for large tanks and +/- 1% for smaller tanks when using the ultrasonic sensor, user-set alarm levels and automatic low tank-level messaging via email or cell phone, the ability to operate in a wide range of operating environments from -40ºC to 60ºC, long battery life, quick and easy installation, secure data transmission via satellite, the ability to integrate directly into delivery scheduling management systems and the ability to monitor any tank anywhere in the world. 
Customers 
 Customers of the Xact Tank Monitoring System include large, regional and local propane distributors, such as Superior Propane (Canada), Suburban Propane (U.S.), AmeriGas (U.S.), Pacific Propane (U.S.) and TermoGas (Mexico). The Company is currently focusing its business development efforts on the propane industry in the United States and Canada.

(Wesroc), NasCorp (SkyTracker), WACnGO, Silicon Controls, TankLink, Centeron, TankScan, Enertrac, SkyBitz and Tankutility. 
Other Measurement Segment Products 
 Also included in the Measurement segment are the following products, however, these products are either being phased out, sold or are no longer actively being produced: 
 TMS  TMS (Texture Measurement System) 2000-RC is an accurate non-contact texture measurement system. The product (used on aluminum substrates) provides fast, accurate and repeatable microroughness measurements while quadrupling production throughput when compared to other testing devices. Surface roughness can be measured to levels below 0.5 Angstroms. An Angstrom (Å) is a unit of measure equal to 1 hundred-millionth of a centimeter (the point of a needle is one million Å in diameter). 
 Lasercheck  Lasercheck is a unique laser-based non-contact roughness gauge incorporating patented laser light-scatter technology that can make precise and repeatable surface roughness measurements in the 0.025 to 2 micron (<1.0 to 80 micro inches) range. Lasercheck provides high-speed in-process measurements in a fraction of a second and is optimized for surface measurements of ground, sanded, polished, hone, super-finished and shot-blasted surfaces. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company signed an agreement to transfer inventory and service requirements to a third party in exchange for payments to be made over a 90-day period. 
 Complete Angle Scatter Instrument (CASI Scatterometers) and MicroScan  The CASI Scatterometer uses visible, ultraviolet or infrared laser light as a nondestructive probe to measure surface quality, optical performance, smoothness, appearance, defects and contamination on a wide variety of materials. These products are scientific measurement instruments providing customers with molecular-level precision in roughness measurement of optical surfaces, diffuse materials, semiconductor wafers, magnetic storage media and precision-machined surfaces, as well as surfaces affecting the cosmetic appearance of consumer products. The MicroScan system is a portable device consisting of a hand-held control unit, an interchangeable measurement head and a separate charging unit. To perform a measurement, the operator places the measurement head on the objective area and presses a button. Each measurement takes less than five seconds with results displayed and stored in system memory. The MicroScan can store 700 measurements in 255 files and provides the capability to program pass/fail criteria. Software is available for control, analysis and file conversion. From a single measurement, a user can determine RMS surface roughness, reflectance and scatter light levels (BRDF) on either flat or curved surfaces and under any lighting conditions. During Fiscal 2017, the Company signed an agreement to transfer the assets and technology associated with the CASI and Microscan products in exchange for royalty payments over a seven-year period. 
 In Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, net sales of Measurement products totaled $4,861,233, $5,315,169 and $4,722,607, respectively, and accounted for 35%, 43% and 40% of the Companys total sales in Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business and Marketing Strategy 
 The Company designs, manufactures and markets all of its products with operations divided into a number of different channels and geographies. 
 Balancer Segment Products 
 The Company markets and sells its SBS products in a variety of ways. First, selling channels are provided by independent manufacturers representatives and distributors. There are currently approximately 65 individuals and/or organizations throughout the world acting in one of these capacities, including approximately 15 in the United States and seven in China. 
 Second, OEMs integrate the SBS products on the machine tools they produce. Users thus purchase the SBS products concurrently with the machine tools. Conversely, end users of grinding machines that have purchased the SBS system directly from the Company, after enjoying the benefits of our products, often request that SBS products be included with the new equipment they order from OEMs. The SBS systems are often installed by machine tool builders prior to displaying their own machine tools at various trade shows, becoming endorsements that prove beneficial to the Companys sales efforts. 
 Third, worldwide trade shows have proven to be an excellent source of business. Company representatives, usually one or more of the marketing managers and the CEO and/or VP of Operations, attend these events along with local Company representatives. These individuals operate a display booth featuring an SBS System demonstration stand and product and technical literature. Representatives from all facets of the Companys target markets attend these trade shows. 
 In North America and Asia, products are shipped directly to customers from the Companys factory in Portland, Oregon. Where the Company has distributors, the product is shipped to the distributor, who in turn pays the Company directly and then delivers and installs the product for the end user. European distribution to customers is handled by shipping the product directly from the Companys Portland headquarters to its European subsidiary in the United Kingdom, which in turn sells and distributes the products. 
 Measurement Segment Products 
 Similar to the Balancer segment, the Measurement segment uses a variety of methods to market and sell its products. Primarily, our sales and marketing managers direct the overall worldwide sales and marketing efforts for the Acuity and Xact products, including the management of distributors in selected markets. In addition, trade shows have recently proven to be an excellent source of business. Representatives from all facets of the Companys target markets attend these trade shows. All Measurement segment products are assembled in the Portland, Oregon facility and shipped worldwide directly to customers. 
Page 9 


 Backlog 
 The Company does not generally track backlog. Normally, orders are shipped within one to two weeks after receipt unless the customer requests otherwise. 
 Manufacturing 
 There are no unique sources of supply or raw materials in any product lines. Essential electronic components, available in large quantities from various suppliers, are assembled into the Balancing and Measurement electronic control units under the Companys quality and assembly standards. Company-owned software and firmware are coupled with the electronic components to provide the basis of the Companys various electronic control units. Management believes several supply sources exist for all electronic components and assembly work incorporated into its electronic control systems. Mechanical parts for the Companys products are produced by high quality machine shops. The Company is not dependent on any one supplier of mechanical components. In the event of supply problems, the Company believes that two or three alternatives could be developed within 30 days. The Company is subject to availability and pricing on the various components parts purchased, which has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on operations. 
 The Company uses in-house skilled assemblers to construct and test vendor-supplied components. Component inventory of finished vendor-supplied parts is held on Company property to assure adequate flow of parts to meet customer order requirements. Inventory is monitored by a computer control system designed to assure timely re-ordering of components. In-house personnel assemble various products and test all finished components before placing them in the finished goods inventory. Finished goods inventory is maintained via computer to assure timely shipment and service to customers. All customer shipments are from the finished goods inventory. 
 The Companys Quality Control Program first received full ISO 9001 certification in 1996. In 2005, the Company received its certification to the newer ISO 9001:2000 requirements and received subsequent recertification in 2011, 2014 and 2017. 
 Proprietary Technology 
 The Companys success depends in part on its proprietary technology, which the Company protects through patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. The Company has U.S. patents covering both Balancer and Measurement products, processes and methods that the Company believes provide it with a competitive advantage. The Company has a policy of seeking patents, where appropriate, on inventions concerning new products and improvements developed as part of its ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities. While patents provide certain legal rights of enforceability, there can be no assurance the historic legal standards surrounding questions of validity and enforceability will continue to be applied or that current defenses with respect to issued patents will, in fact, be considered substantial in the future. There can be no assurance as to the degree and range of protection any patent will afford and whether patents will be issued or the extent to which the Company may inadvertently infringe upon patents granted to others. 
 The Company manufactures its Balancer segment products under copyright protection in the U.S. for electronic board designs. Encapsulation of the finished product further protects the Companys technologies including software. 
 The Company also relies upon trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the Companys trade secrets or disclose such technology or that the Company can meaningfully protect its trade secrets. 
 
Page 10 


 While the Company pursues patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright protection for products and various trademarks, it also relies on know-how and continuing technology advancement, manufacturing capabilities, affordable high-quality products, new product introduction and direct marketing efforts to develop and maintain its competitive position. 
 Product Development
