     ITG’s business is organized into four reportable operating segments: U.S. Operations, Canadian Operations, European Operations and Asia Pacific Operations (see Note 24, Segment Reporting, to the consolidated financial statements). These four operating segments provide the following categories of products and services:
    
· | Execution Services — includes (a) liquidity matching through POSIT, our Alternative Trading System (“ATS”), (b) self-directed trading using algorithms (including single stocks and portfolio lists) and smart
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

routing, (c) portfolio trading and single stock sales trading desks providing execution expertise and (d) futures and options trading
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Workflow Technology — includes trade order and execution management software applications in addition to network connectivity
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analytics — includes (a) tools enabling portfolio managers and traders to improve pre-trade, real-time and post-trade execution performance, (b) portfolio construction and optimization decisions and (c) securities valuation
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Regional segment results exclude the impact of corporate activity, which is presented separately and includes investment income from treasury activity, certain non-operating revenues and other gains as well as costs not associated with operating the businesses within the Company’s regional segments. These costs include, among others, (a) the costs of being a public company, such as certain staff costs, a portion of external audit fees, and reporting, filing and listing costs, (b) intangible asset amortization, (c) interest expense, (d) professional fees associated with our global transfer pricing structure, (e) foreign exchange gains or losses and (f) certain non‑operating expenses.
 Execution Services
 ITG execution services includes liquidity matching through POSIT, self‑directed trading by clients using algorithms (including single stocks and portfolio lists) and smart routing and futures and options trading. ITG also provides execution expertise through portfolio trading and single stock trading desks. POSIT
 POSIT was launched in 1987 as a point‑in‑time electronic crossing network. Today, POSIT provides anonymous continuous crossing of non‑displayed (or dark) equity orders and price improvement opportunities within the published best bid and offer price. 
 POSIT Alert is a block crossing mechanism within POSIT. POSIT Alert scans uncommitted shares from participating clients. When a crossing opportunity is detected, POSIT Alert notifies the relevant buy‑side users that a matching opportunity exists.
 The Dark aggregation algorithm (formerly branded as POSIT Marketplace) provides access to POSIT liquidity, the dark pools of other ATSs, and certain exchange dark order types. Dark is a dark pool aggregator that provides clients with access to a large range of non‑displayed liquidity destinations. Dark uses advanced quantitative techniques in an effort to interact with quality liquidity while helping to protect clients from gaming.
 ITG’s Algorithms and Smart Order Router
 ITG’s algorithms and smart order router enable portfolio managers and traders to trade orders quickly, comprehensively and cost‑efficiently from our Execution Management Systems (“EMS”) or our Order Management System (“OMS”) and most third‑party trading platforms. The algorithms execute orders anonymously and discreetly, thereby potentially lowering market impact costs and improving overall performance. ITG’s algorithms help users pursue best execution through two suites: ITG Single‑Stock Algorithms and ITG List‑Based Algorithms.
 Our smart order router offers a solution for routing trades that can help capture liquidity with a combination of speed and confidentiality. These routers continuously scan markets for liquidity with an emphasis on trading without displaying the order. Our smart order router uses proprietary techniques to quickly execute at the best available prices.
 Single Stock and Portfolio Trading
 ITG provides single-stock sales trading as well as portfolio trading for institutional clients. ITG’s trading desks are staffed with experienced trading professionals who provide ITG clients with execution through advanced electronic tools.

 Matrix Holding Group
 In September 2017, we signed a definitive agreement to form Matrix Holdings Group (“Matrix”), a derivatives execution and technology business focused on sell-side clients, professional traders and select hedge funds. The transaction closed on February 16, 2018. We currently hold an approximate 10% indirect stake in the underlying operating subsidiaries of Matrix and we leverage the technology of this venture to provide U.S. derivatives execution to our institutional client base. (see Note 5, Equity Investment, to the consolidated financial statements). Workflow Technology
 Execution Management and Order Management
 Our EMS is designed to meet the needs of a broad range of trading styles. Triton is ITG’s award‑winning, multi‑asset and broker‑neutral EMS, which brings a complete set of integrated execution and analytical tools to the user’s desktop, including the Algo Wheel. The Algo Wheel is a broker-neutral tool for allocating trades to broker algorithms in an unbiased systematic fashion using a quantifiable method for evaluating and rewarding brokers for performance. Triton supports global list‑based and single‑stock trading, as well as futures and options capabilities and includes a fully integrated and supported financial services communications network (ITG Net). Triton also provides traders with access to scalable, low‑latency, multi‑asset trading opportunities.
 Our OMS combines portfolio management, compliance functionality (ITG’s Compliance Monitoring System), and a fully integrated and supported financial services communications network (ITG Net) with a consolidated, outsourced service for global trade matching and settlement (Trade Ops) that provides connectivity to the industry’s post‑trade utilities, as well as support for multiple, flexible settlement communication methods and a real‑time process monitor.
 ITG Net
 ITG Net is a global financial communications network that provides secure, reliable and fully supported connectivity between buy‑side and sell‑side firms for multi‑asset order routing and indication‑of‑interest messages with ITG and third‑party trading platforms. ITG Net supports approximately 9,000 global billable connections to more than 600 unique execution destinations worldwide. ITG Net also integrates the trading products of third‑party brokers and ATSs into our OMS and EMS platforms.
 RFQ‑hub
 RFQ‑hub, a multi‑asset platform for global listed and over‑the‑counter (“OTC”) financial instruments, connects buy‑side trading desks and portfolio managers with a large network of sell‑side market makers in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region, allowing these trading desks to place requests‑for‑quotes (“RFQ”) in negotiated equities, futures, options, swaps, convertible bonds, structured products and commodities. RFQ‑hub is available as a stand‑alone platform and is also integrated with Triton.
 Single Ticket Clearing
 ITG’s commitment to best execution also extends to broker‑neutral operational services to help ensure that trades clear and settle efficiently, and to significantly lower the transaction costs associated with trade tickets. Single Ticket Clearing is a broker‑neutral service that aggregates executions across multiple destinations for settlement purposes. Single Ticket Clearing helps reduce the number of trade tickets and resulting charges imposed by custodians, reducing the costs of trade processing due to market fragmentation. Commission Management Services
 ITG offers administration and consolidation of client commission arrangements across a wide range of our clients’ preferred brokerage and research providers through Commission Manager, a robust, multi‑asset, web‑based commission management portal, and Budget Tracker, which enables asset managers to set research valuations and create and track budgets for their end clients. ITG also offers a comprehensive research payment account solution, enabling

clients to unbundle research and execution payments to comply with the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) II regulations.
 Analytics
 Trading Analytics
 Our trading analytics suite enables portfolio managers and traders to improve execution performance before the trade happens (pre‑trade) and during trading (real‑time) by providing reliable trading analytics and risk models that help them perform predictive analyses, manage risk, change strategy and reduce trading costs. Trading costs are affected by multiple factors, such as execution strategies, time horizon, volatility, spread, volume and order size. Our trading analytics suite gauges the effects of these factors and aids in the understanding of the trade‑off between market impact and opportunity cost.
 Our transaction cost analysis (“TCA”) offers robust measurement and reporting capabilities to analyze costs and performance across the trading continuum. TCA assesses trading performance and implicit costs under various market conditions so users can adjust strategies and potentially reduce costs and boost investment performance. TCA is also available for foreign exchange transactions (TCA for FX) and for corporate and sovereign bond trading (Fixed Income TCA).
 Alpha Capture Reporting measures cost at every point of the investment process and provides portfolio managers with quarterly analytical reviews, written interpretations and on‑site consultative recommendations to enhance performance.
 Portfolio Analytics
 ITG provides market‑leading tools to assist asset managers with portfolio decision‑making tasks, from portfolio construction and optimization to the enterprise challenge of global, real‑time portfolio performance monitoring.
 Fair Value helps mutual fund managers meet their obligations to investors and regulators to fairly price the securities within their funds, and helps minimize the impact of market timing.
 ITG Opt allows portfolio managers to develop new portfolio construction strategies and solve complex optimization problems. ITG Opt allows users to accurately model tax liability, transaction costs and long/short objectives, while adhering to diverse portfolio‑specific constraints.
 Non‑U.S. Operations
 ITG has established a strong and growing presence in key financial centers around the world to serve the needs of global institutional investors. In addition to its New York headquarters, ITG has North American offices in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto. In Europe, ITG has offices in London, Dublin and Paris. In the Asia Pacific region, ITG has offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Melbourne. Local representation in regional markets provides an important competitive advantage for ITG. ITG also provides electronic and single stock sales trading for Latin American equities from its New York headquarters, including algorithms for Brazil, Mexico and Chile, and POSIT Alert on-exchange block crossing in Brazil and Mexico, as well as single stock sales trading access into Colombia and Peru.
 Canadian Operations
 ITG Canada was founded in 2000. ITG Canada provides electronic brokerage services, including ITG’s algorithms and smart order router, as well as single stock execution, portfolio trading services and commission management services. In addition, ITG Canada provides Triton, connectivity services, Single Ticket Clearing, ITG Opt, trading analytics, TCA, and Fair Value. ITG Canada also engages in foreign exchange trading to facilitate equity trades by clients in different currencies as well as other client foreign exchange trades unrelated to equity trades. 
 In July 2007, ITG Canada launched MATCHNow, an ATS for Canadian‑listed equities, operated by ITG’s wholly‑owned subsidiary, TriAct Canada Marketplace LP (“TriAct”). MATCHNow is a leading dark pool ATS in

Canada, offering a call auction marketplace with a confidential non‑displayed book with trades executed at or within the Canadian National Best Bid and Offer.
 European Operations
 ITG Europe was established as a broker‑dealer in 1998. Today, ITG Europe focuses on trading European, Middle Eastern and African equities as well as providing ITG’s technologies to its clients. ITG Europe provides electronic brokerage services including ITG’s algorithms and smart order router, and the POSIT suite, as well as single stock execution services, portfolio trading services and commission management services. In January 2018, ITG (a) expanded its dark cash equity orders segment to include an any price point system and reference price system, in each case, for large sized orders that are not subject to the MiFID II double volume caps set at 4% of all the dark regulated venue trading volume in a given security for any individual dark venue and 8% of such volume for all dark trading venues in the aggregate and (b) launched POSIT Auction, a lit segment on the POSIT Multilateral Trading Facility (“MTF”) which provides additional access to liquidity under MiFID II trading rules. In Europe, ITG provides Triton, OMS, connectivity services, Single Ticket Clearing, RFQ‑hub, TCA, Alpha Capture Reporting, trading analytics and Fair Value. Asia Pacific Operations
 Australia
 In 1997, ITG launched ITG Australia, an institutional brokerage firm specializing in execution and analytics for Australian‑listed equities. ITG provides clients with a range of products and services including trade execution, trade execution management through Triton, connectivity services and pre‑ and post‑trade analysis through TCA and trading analytics.

Other trading and analytical tools provided by ITG Hong Kong include Triton, connectivity services, TCA and trading analytics. Singapore
 In 2010, ITG Singapore Pte. Limited (“ITG Singapore”) obtained a Capital Markets Services License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). ITG Singapore provides clients in Singapore with a range of ITG’s products and services including trade execution management through Triton and trading analysis through TCA and trading analytics. Competition
 The financial services industry generally, and the institutional securities brokerage business in which we operate, are extremely competitive, and we expect them to remain so for the foreseeable future. Our full suite of products does not directly compete with any particular firm; however, individual products compete with various firms and consortia:
· | Our trading and portfolio analytics compete with offerings from several sell‑side‑affiliated and independent companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | POSIT and MATCHNow compete with various national and regional securities exchanges, ATSs, Electronic Communication Networks, MTFs and systematic internalizers for trade execution services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Our EMSs, OMS, connectivity and RFQ services compete with offerings from independent vendors, agency‑only firms and other sell‑side firms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our algorithmic and smart routing products, as well as our high‑touch agency execution and portfolio trading services, compete with agency‑only and other sell‑side firms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In many cases we face competitors that are larger and have greater financial resources than ITG. These competitors may have more flexibility to offer a broader set of products and services than we can. Competition is also intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals. The performance of our business is in large part dependent on the skills, expertise and performance of our employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals.
 Regulation
 Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws, with the regulation of broker‑dealers primarily delegated to self‑regulatory organizations (“SROs”), principally the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) as well as other national securities exchanges. In addition to federal and SRO oversight, securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business. Furthermore, our non‑U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation by central banks and regulatory bodies in those jurisdictions where each subsidiary is authorized to do business, as further discussed below. The SROs, central banks and regulatory bodies conduct periodic examinations of our broker‑dealer subsidiaries in accordance with the rules they have adopted and amended from time to time.

Additional legislation or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the mode of operation and profitability of broker‑dealers. The SEC, SROs, state securities commissions and foreign regulatory authorities may conduct administrative proceedings or commence judicial actions, which can result in censure, judgments, settlements, fines, disgorgements, penalties, injunctions, the issuance of cease‑and‑desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker‑dealer, its directors, officers or employees.
 ITG Inc. and AlterNet are required by law to belong to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).

 Regulation ATS
 Regulation ATS permits U.S. “alternative trading systems” such as POSIT to match orders submitted by buyers and sellers without having to register as a national securities exchange. Accordingly, POSIT is not registered with the SEC as an exchange. We continue to review and monitor POSIT’s systems and procedures to ensure compliance with Regulation ATS. The Form ATS describing the operations of POSIT in the U.S. is publicly available at http://www.itg.com/about/transparency/. On July 18, 2018, the SEC unanimously adopted amendments (the “Final ATS Amendments”) to Regulation ATS and related rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) to enhance transparency requirements on, and increase the SEC’s oversight of, ATSs that facilitate transactions in National Market System stocks (generally, exchange-listed equities) (“NMS Stock ATSs”).  The regulation became effective on October 9, 2018.  The amendments require, among other things, a publicly-available Form ATS-N containing disclosures about the operation of the ATS and the interactions between the ATS, its affiliates, and other firm products (e.g. smart routers and algorithms). We filed our first Form ATS-N on February 8, 2019.
 Net Capital Requirement
 ITG Inc. and AlterNet are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3‑1) under the Exchange Act, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital.
 ITG Inc. has elected to use the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3‑1, which requires that ITG Inc. maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions, as defined. AlterNet has elected to use the basic method permitted by Rule 15c3‑1, which requires that they maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 62/3% of aggregate indebtedness or $100,000. Dividends or withdrawals of capital cannot be made if capital is needed to comply with regulatory requirements.  In addition, our Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations have subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements.

 For further information on our net capital position, see Note 18, Net Capital Requirement, to the consolidated financial statements.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position.
 We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications, in the U.S. and abroad, that principally relate to financial services, information technology and software. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. We also own and maintain a portfolio of trademarks. The extent and duration of trademark rights are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.
 While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is heavily dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
 It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property ownership agreements with our clients, employees, independent contractors and business partners, and to control access to, and distribution of, our intellectual property.
 Clients
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no single client accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated revenue.
 Employees
 On December 31, 2018, the Company employed 883 staff globally, of whom 521, 91, 164 and 107 staff were employed by the U.S., Canadian, European and Asia Pacific Operations, respectively.
 Website and Availability of Public Reports

We are required to file reports and other information with the SEC. Our Annual Reports on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q and Current Reports on Form 8‑K, together with any amendments to those reports, are available without charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Prior to the Merger, these filings were also available on ITG’s website (http://investor.itg.com).
