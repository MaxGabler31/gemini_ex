Item 1. Business
 
Addentax Group Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 28, 2014. We were originally incorporated to produce images on multiple surfaces, such as glass, leather, plastic, ceramic, textile, and others using a 3D sublimation vacuum heat transfer machine. We no longer pursue opportunities related to 3D printing positioning.
 
On December 28, 2016, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd. (“YICG”), which was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and principally engaged in garment manufacture, where we agreed to acquire 100% of the equity interest in YICG and to issue five hundred million (500,000,000) restricted common shares of the Company to YICG. The completion of the SPA took place on September 25, 2017. Following the completion of the SPA, YICG’s business became our business.

Our garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesaler located in the PRC. We have our own manufacturing facilities, with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that we meet our high quality control standards and timely meet the delivery requirements for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations through four wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”), Dongguan Yushang Clothing Co., Ltd (“YS”), Shantou Yi Bai Yi Garment Co., Ltd (“YBY”), and Shantou Chenghai Dai Tou Garments Co., Ltd (“DT”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China. In October 2020, the Company disposed of DT to a third party at fair value, which was also its carrying value as of September 30, 2020.
 
Our logistics business consists of delivery and courier services covering 79 cities in seven provinces and two municipalities in China. Although we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping drivers during slow seasons. We conduct our logistic operations through four wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd (“XKJ”), Shenzhen Hua Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“HPF”), Shenzhen Yingxi Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“PF”) and Shenzhen Yingxi Tongda Logistic Co., Ltd (“TD”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China. In November 2020, the Company disposed of HPF to a third party at fair value, which was also its carrying value as of November 30, 2020.
 
The business operations, customers and suppliers of DT and HPF were retained by the Company; therefore, the disposition of the two subsidiaries did not qualify as discontinued operations.
 
Our property management and subleasing business provides shops subleasing and property management services for garment wholesalers and retailers in garment market. We conduct our property management and subleasing operation through a wholly owned subsidiary, namely Dongguan Yingxi Daying Commercial Co., Ltd. (“DY”), which is located in the Guangdong province, China.
 
Our epidemic prevention supplies business consists of manufacturing and distribution of epidemic prevention products and resale of epidemic prevention supplies purchased from third parties in both domestic and overseas markets. We conduct our manufacturing of the epidemic prevention products in Dongguan Yushang Clothing Co., Ltd (“YS”). We conduct the trading of epidemic prevention suppliers through Addentax and Shenzhen Qianhai Yingxi Industrial Chain Services Co., Ltd (“YX”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is located in the Guangdong province in China.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 
Cost-effective production. We have adopted a vertical integration production process. We produce garments in our own production facilities and employ our in-house transport teams to deliver garments to our customers. This one-stop service optimizes production efficiency and saves costs by lowering the cost per unit, thereby achieving economies of scale.
 
Stringent quality control process. As of March 31, 2022, we had seven employees in the production department that are responsible for conducting our quality control process. We implement a stringent quality control process which monitors various stages of our garment manufacturing business, including sampling checks of semi-finished products and finished products. We prepare inspection reports to address the quality problems and make recommendations to improve the quality of our products. During final product inspection, we pay special attention to the measurements, workmanship, ironing and packaging of our products to help best ensure that the quality of our products comply with the specifications, standards and requirements of our customers.
 
Strong design capabilities. Our design team works closely with our customers to understand their needs and make recommendations to them. Our design team also conducts market research and attends industry exhibitions to understand the latest market trends. As of March 31, 2022, our design team consisted of five members.

Extensive delivery network. Our logistics business has nine routes and covers 79 cities in seven provinces and two municipalities in the PRC.
 
Stable Production Supply Chain. We integrated various epidemic prevention suppliers located in China & Malaysia and established strategic cooperation relationship with them, which can help us to purchase the epidemic prevention products in competitive lower price and stable supply. We also received mask production license from relevant governance and some of the products we manufactured passed the inspection of quality inspection agency.
 
Business Strategies
 
Key elements of our business and growth strategies include the following:
 
Sales of raw materials. We intend to enter into exclusive agreements with textile and garment suppliers in Southeast China to be their exclusive agent and supply their textiles and garments to our customers. To execute this plan, we intend to set up several retailers for the sales of textiles and garments to retail customers and supply the textiles and garments exclusively to various high-end fashion brands.
 
Development of our own brands. We intend to develop our own brands that focus on fast fashion with teenagers being our primary target customers. We plan to adopt a low-cost strategy at the early stage and improve the quality of our products after increasing our market share. We are in the process of registering a trademark for our own brand and intend to start our advertising campaign after the registration of this trademark. We plan to distribute our products in different channels, including our own retailers, co-operative retailers and franchisees.
 
Expand our delivery network. As of March 31, 2022, we provided logistics services to over 79 cities in seven provinces and two municipalities in the PRC. We expect to develop 20 additional logistics routes in existing serving cities and improve the Company’s profits in the year of 2023.
 
Develop international logistics services and warehousing services. We intend to develop international logistics services for customers located all over the world and international warehousing services.
 
Development of international trading. We developed our international trading during the global epidemic situation of Covid-19 to import and export diverse epidemic protection products including medical masks, latex gloves etc.
 
Develop E-commerce business. We integrated resources in shopping mall, intend to develop e-commerce bases and the internet celebrity economy together to drive to increase the value of the stores in the area.
 
Develop our epidemic prevention supply chain. We intend to develop our own epidemic prevention supply chain as we see the potential and opportunity of medical and health industry. We expect to establish a one-step epidemic prevention supply chain from product manufacturing line establishment to sales networking construction. Currently, we are focusing on the civil mask market in China and provide cost-effective masks to customers. We will improve our product quality constantly and develop oversee markets.

Our product and technical team is mainly responsible for development samples of products, preparing structural and production guidance of products as well as producing paper patterns for our garment production team. Upon order confirmation from our customers, our customer relationship team informs our fabric team to carry out raw material sourcing.
 
We source finished fabric and yarns from our suppliers for garment production. The procedures for fabric production are normally divided into the following stages: (i) spinning; (ii) weaving or knitting; (iii) dyeing or printing; and (iv) finishing. Generally, our fabric team requires four to six weeks to source raw materials from our suppliers.

Our logistics business
 
We pack products and provide logistics service to our customers through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, XKJ and PF which are located in Guangdong province, the PRC. Our in-house logistics teams deliver to approximately seven provinces and two municipalities in the PRC.

Where a customer is located in an area not covered by our delivery fleet or where our in-house logistics teams are fully engaged, we will outsource delivery to third-party contractors. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our delivery capacity and improve inventory flexibility while minimizing capital expenditures, such as shipping costs and the costs of additional drivers during low seasons.

According to PRC regulations, we must participate in various employee social security plans organized by local governments, including pension, unemployment insurance, childbirth insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing insurance. We are also required under PRC law to contribute to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time.
 
We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and to date we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
 
Government Regulations
 
Currently, apart from customary business laws and regulations, the PRC government does not regulate the garment manufacturing business and logistics business. The PRC government may, however, from time to time institute rules and regulations on such businesses which makes it difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in the PRC. Please see the section on “Risk Factors” for further details.
 
The PRC government encourages small to medium-sized companies in traditional industries, such as garment manufacturing, to modernize their business models with technological updates in order to sharpen their competitive edge in global markets.
 
PRC Limitation on Overseas Listing and Share Issuances
 
We nor our subsidiaries are currently required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to list on U.S. exchanges or issue securities to foreign investors, however, if our subsidiaries or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. It is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC central or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry; if we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required when they are, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain approval in the future.
 
On December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, issued Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the “Administration Provisions”), and the Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Measures”), which were open for public comments by January 23, 2022. The Administration Provisions and Measures for overseas listings lay out specific requirements for filing documents and include unified regulation management, strengthening regulatory coordination, and cross-border regulatory cooperation. Domestic companies seeking to list abroad must carry out relevant security screening procedures if their businesses involve supervisions such as foreign investment security and cyber security reviews. Companies endangering national security are among those off-limits for overseas listings. As the Administration Provisions and Measures have not yet come into effect, we are currently unaffected by them. However, it is uncertain when the Administration Provision and the Measures will take effect or if they will take effect as currently drafted.
 
As of the date of this annual report, other than the response we recently received from the CSRC confirming that our offering does not require the examination and approval of the CSRC in accordance with the existing PRC legislation and regulations (for more details about this response from the CSRC, see “Risk Factors – General Risks Associated with Business Operation in China - While the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission is not currently required for our offerings, it may be required in the future in connection with our offerings under the M&A Rules and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval”), we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions or regulatory objection to our offerings from the CSRC, CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities, and we believe our PRC Subsidiaries have obtained all requisite permissions from PRC governmental authorities to operate our business as currently conducted under relevant PRC laws and regulations.
 
Currently, each of our PRC Subsidiaries holds and maintains a business license issued by the local market supervision and administration bureau, and has received all requisite permissions in order to conduct and operate our business. As of the date of this annual report, none of our PRC Subsidiaries has been denied or punished by relevant governmental authorities due to its business qualifications.
 
Transfers of Cash to and from our Subsidiaries
 
We (Addentax Group Corp.) are a Nevada holding company with no material operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our operations through the operating companies established in the PRC, primarily Shenzhen Qianhai Yingxi Industrial Chain Service Co., Ltd. (“YX”), our wholly owned subsidiary and its subsidiaries. We are not a Chinese operating company. We are a holding company and do not directly own any substantive business operations in China. As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, Addentax’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend upon dividends paid by our PRC Subsidiaries. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to Addentax. In addition, our PRC Subsidiaries are required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies.
 
Current PRC regulations permit our PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends to us through Yingxi HK, our intermediate holding subsidiary in Hong Kong, only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our PRC Subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.

The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our PRC Subsidiaries incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments.
 
Cash dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.
 
In order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on the distribution of dividends, through the WFOE, to Yingxi HK from our PRC Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, none of our PRC Subsidiaries has distributed any dividends to Yingxi HK.
 
Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns no less than 25% of a PRC project. However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements must be satisfied, including without limitation that (a) the Hong Kong project must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong Kong project must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC project during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong project must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by our WFOE to its immediate holding company, Yingxi HK. As of the date of this annual report, we have not applied for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. Yingxi HK intends to apply for the tax resident certificate when WFOE plans to declare and pay dividends to Yingxi HK.
 
As of the date hereof, we have had no transactions that involved the transfer of cash or assets throughout our corporate structure. The PRC Subsidiaries have not transferred cash or other assets to Addentax, including by way of dividends. Addentax does not currently plan or anticipate transferring cash or other assets from our operations in China to any non-Chinese entity. As of the date hereof, no transfers, dividends, or distributions have been made to our investors.
 
Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act
 
Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor.
 
Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People’s Republic of China because of a position taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations.
 
The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate.

Our auditor, BF Borgers CPA PC, is an independent registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB, and as an auditor of publicly traded companies in the U.S., is subject to laws in the U.S. pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. BF Borgers CPA PC is based in the United States and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis, with the last inspection in November and December of 2021. BF Borgers CPA PC, is not headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong and was not identified as a firm subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. Should the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct inspection of our auditor’s work papers in China, it will make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures or equity control procedures. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures or quality of the financial statements, which would adversely affect us and our securities.
 
Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, an exchange may determine to delist our securities.
 
Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. If the AHFCAA is enacted, and if we are subject to it, it would decrease the number of “non-inspection years” from three years to two years, and thus, would reduce the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted.
