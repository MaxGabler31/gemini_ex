Item 1. Business. 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic compounds to treat diseases with high unmet needs through the inhibition of the complement system, which is an integral component of the immune system, at the level of C3, the central protein in the complement cascade. We believe that this approach can result in broad inhibition of the principal pathways of the complement system and has the potential to effectively control a broad array of complement-dependent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 
 
In May 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, approved EMPAVELI (systemic pegcetacoplan), the first targeted C3 therapy and our first approved product, for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH. EMPAVELI is approved for use in adults with PNH and can be used by patients who are either treatment-naïve or who are switching from C5 inhibitors eculizumab or ravulizumab. We believe that EMPAVELI has the potential to elevate the standard of care in PNH and are seeking to establish EMPAVELI as the preferred first-line treatment for patients. In the United States, there are approximately 1,500 patients with PNH currently being treated with C5 inhibitors and another 150 patients who we estimate will be newly diagnosed each year. Between our launch of EMPAVELI in May 2021 through December 31, 2021, we generated $15.1 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI.
 
In December 2021, the European Commission, or the EC, approved Aspaveli (systemic pegcetacoplan) for the treatment of adults with PNH who are anemic after treatment with a C5 inhibitor for at least three months. In January 2022, systemic pegcetacoplan was also approved for the treatment of PNH in Saudi Arabia and Australia. Systemic pegcetacoplan is currently marketed under the trade name EMPAVELI™ in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia and Aspaveli® in the European Union. Under our collaboration and license agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Publ), or Sobi. Sobi has global co-development and exclusive ex-U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan and intends to initiate the commercial launch of Aspaveli in jurisdictions outside of the United States during the first quarter of 2022. We have commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan in the United States.
 
We also are leveraging our expertise in targeting C3 to advance intravitreal pegcetacoplan as the first potential treatment for geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. Intravitreal pegcetacoplan has the potential to be a breakthrough for patients with GA, a disease that affects approximately one million people in the U.S. and five million people worldwide. Based on the results of our Phase 3 (DERBY and OAKS) and Phase 2 (FILLY) clinical trials of intravitreal pegcetacoplan, we intend to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA in the second quarter of 2022 with a request for six-month priority review. We also plan to submit a market authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, in the second half of 2022. We have exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights for intravitreal pegcetacoplan.
 
We believe that inhibition of the complement system by targeting C3 may enable a broad range of therapeutic approaches, and that pegcetacoplan has the potential to address the limitations of existing treatment options or provide a treatment option in indications where there currently are none. Under our collaboration with Sobi, we are co-developing systemic pegcetacoplan for cold agglutinin disease, or CAD, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or HSCT-TMA, in hematology; C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, and immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or IC-MPGN, in nephrology; and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in neurology. 
 
We are also evaluating the administration of systemic pegcetacoplan as an approach to enabling adeno-associated virus, or AAV, vector administration for gene therapies. Gene therapies delivered by AAVs have historically faced safety and tolerability challenges associated with potentially severe, or even fatal, side effects in patients.  We believe complement inhibition may yield benefits when used in combination with AAV-delivered gene therapies. In collaboration with commercial and academic researchers, we are conducting pre-clinical studies to assess the impact of complement inhibition on AAV-delivered gene therapies and expect to report pre-clinical data in the first half of 2022.
 
Lastly, we are developing other product candidates with other routes of administration and plan to conduct clinical trials of these product candidates, including the combination of EMPAVELI and a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, which may offer the potential to reduce the treatment frequency of EMPAVELI by reducing the production of C3 proteins in the liver. Furthermore, we are collaborating with Beam Therapeutics, Inc., or Beam, on six research programs focused on C3 and other complement targets in the eye, liver and brain, using Beam’s proprietary base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement-driven diseases.
 
Our Approach 
 The complement system plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune systems. Complement proteins are produced primarily by the liver and circulate in the blood and through the body’s tissues. The complement system may be activated through 
 4

three principal pathways known as the classical, lectin and alternative pathways, each of which requires the C3 protein to enable three principal immune responses: opsonization, inflammation and formation of the membrane attack complex, or MAC. When C3 is activated, C3 fragments, such as C3b, tag cell surfaces in a process called opsonization, which marks the cells for removal from tissues or the bloodstream. Two other fragments, C3a and C5a, are released, contributing to inflammation in the surrounding tissues. Further complement activation causes membrane attack complex formation on cell surfaces, piercing holes and causing cells to lyse, or rupture, and others to depolarize or lose membrane potential.
The following figure depicts the complement system, its three principal activation pathways and its principal effects: 
 

Under conditions of excessive or uncontrolled activation, the complement system is believed to play a key role in the incidence and progression of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In these diseases, the complement system acts directly through tissue destruction by the membrane attack complex and indirectly by signaling other elements of the immune system to inappropriately target otherwise healthy tissues. Because the contribution of complement activation to the development and progression of these diseases is not fully understood, it has been difficult to develop therapeutics that ameliorate the conditions contributing to these diseases by targeting only one of the complement activation pathways. 
 Complement activation and its effects can be inhibited in multiple ways. By targeting complement proteins upstream of C3, one of the three principal activation pathways can be inhibited. For example, inhibition of factor B or factor D results in inhibition of the alternative pathway, but not the classical or lectin pathways. The complement system can also be inhibited by targeting complement proteins downstream of C3, which results in limited inhibition of complement effects. For example, inhibition of C5 leads to inhibition of the formation of the membrane attack complex and C5a-mediated inflammation but does not affect opsonization or C3a-mediated inflammation. 
 We have designed pegcetacoplan to target complement proteins centrally at the level of C3. We believe that this approach can result in broad inhibition of the complement pathways and has the potential to effectively control complement-dependent diseases. We believe that pegcetacoplan has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment and may address the limitations of existing treatment options or provide a treatment option where there is none. 
 Our Strategy 
 We aim to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic compounds to treat diseases in areas such as rare disease, ophthalmology and neurology through the inhibition of the complement system. We hold commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan, which includes EMPAVELI, in the United States and worldwide commercialization rights to intravitreal pegcetacoplan, which includes our GA program, in addition to worldwide 
 5

commercialization rights for our other novel compounds targeting complement. To achieve our goals, we are pursuing the following strategies in 2022 with a continued focus on compassion and commitment to patients:  
  
• | Bringing intravitreal pegcetacoplan as the first-ever therapy to patients with GA. We are developing intravitreal pegcetacoplan as monotherapy for GA. Based on the results of our Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials, we are preparing submissions to regulatory authorities for marketing approval of intravitreal pegcetacoplan as a treatment for GA secondary to AMD. We intend to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second quarter of 2022 with a request for six-month priority review. We also plan to submit an MAA to the EMA in the second half of 2022.

Our Programs 
 Pegcetacoplan targets C3, the central protein of the complement cascade. Pegcetacoplan is a conjugate of a compstatin analogue, formulated both for intravitreal administration by injections directly into the eye, and systemic administration by subcutaneous injection, which is an injection into the tissue under the skin. We have developed and are developing pegcetacoplan and other product candidates through various routes of administration.

Ophthalmology
 We are developing intravitreally delivered pegcetacoplan as a monotherapy for patients with GA.  
 Geographic Atrophy 
 Background 
 GA is a type of advanced age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. According to the Brightfocus Foundation, over ten million people in the United States have some form of AMD. AMD is a disorder of the central portion of the retina in the eye, known as the macula, which is responsible for central vision and color perception. AMD affects vision in one or both eyes and results in progressive and chronic degeneration of the macula, often resulting in irreversible vision loss. AMD is a disease of aging, typically occurring after the age of 50. In the early stage of the disease, yellow deposits, or drusen, appear under the retina. Over time, the disease can progress to an intermediate stage where drusen deposits grow larger and other changes reflective of disease progression appear and then to an advanced stage associated with progressive and often severe vision loss which may be characterized as either GA or wet AMD. GA is characterized by a degenerative process resulting in the progressive loss of retinal cells, which over the course of several years results in blindness. Based on published studies, we estimate that at least five million people worldwide, including at least one million people in the United States, are living with GA.
 At the American Academy of Ophthalmology, or AAO, in November 2020, a retrospective study of 69,000 patients diagnosed with GA was presented that analyzed changes in visual acuity and disease progression over two years. The analysis was presented by Verana Health, a data analysis group in retinal diseases under a collaboration with us, and the AAO’s IRIS (Intelligent Research in Sight) Registry, the nation’s first comprehensive clinical registry for eye disease. Key findings from the real-world clinical data showed: 
  
• | At the first study visit, patients presented with relatively preserved vision, especially in eyes with extrafoveal GA lesions (lesions outside the fovea, which is the central portion of the retina). However, patients with extrafoveal and foveal GA lesions progressively lost vision over time at a rate of approximately five letters on a vision chart per year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progression from GA to new onset wet AMD was observed in 4.7% of patients with bilateral GA (GA in both eyes) and 13.3% of patients with wet AMD in the contralateral eye (AMD in the non-treatment eye) during the first 12 months. The rate at 24 months was 8.2% and 21.6% in bilateral GA and wet AMD in the contralateral eye, respectively.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A large proportion of GA patients did not return for a follow-up visit after two years. Of the GA patients potentially eligible for inclusion in the analysis, only 40% had a follow-up visit after two years and were ultimately included in the study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The mechanism by which complement activation is upregulated and can damage the retina is poorly understood. However, we believe that the upregulation of complement activation due to immune dysregulation damages retinal cells in two ways. First, retinal cells are damaged by inflammation caused by increased levels of C3a and C5a. Second, the increased deposition of C3b on the cell surface of retinal cells caused by complement activation, combined with the limited ability of cells to remove C3 activated fragments such as C3b, leads to the accumulation of C3 fragments on the retinal cells. The presence of C3a and C5a, as well as C3 fragment deposition on retinal cells, activates macrophages and microglia. Macrophages are large white blood cells that form part of the immune system that engulf and digest cells, debris and foreign substances. Macrophages also play an important role in modulating other parts of the immune system. Microglia are a type of tissue-residing macrophage located in the brain, spinal cord and retina. 
 Because pegcetacoplan both blocks the production of C3a and C5a and prevents the accumulation of C3 fragments on retinal cells through the inhibition of C3, we believe that pegcetacoplan may control complement activation in the retinal environment to return it to its quiescent state. We do not believe that selective inhibitors of the alternative pathway, which would only partially block the formation of C3b on the retinal cell surface, or C5 inhibitors, which cannot prevent C3b deposition on retinal cells, can cause the retinal environment to return to its quiescent state. 
 Current Therapies and Their Limitations 
 There are no therapies approved to treat GA. There are, however, therapies in development for GA including a number of product candidates in mid- to late stages of clinical development. 
Benefits of Our Approach 
 We believe intravitreal pegcetacoplan, with its inhibition of complement activation at the level of C3 in the retinal environment, may provide the following benefits: 
  
• | Prevention or reduction of the rate of retinal cell death progression. We believe intravitreal pegcetacoplan may mitigate or prevent retinal cell death in GA, leading to a reduction in GA lesion growth over time. In our Phase 3 DERBY and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OAKS trials and our Phase 2 FILLY trial, pegcetacoplan showed what we believe to be a clinically meaningful reduction of GA lesion growth in both monthly and every-other-month dosing, with a favorable safety profile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential application to all patients with GA independent of complement pathway causing disease progression. Pegcetacoplan, by targeting C3, has been designed to inhibit all three principal complement activation pathways and may therefore be effective in a broad patient population. We believe, based on the genetic marker and other data from our analysis of our Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, that the activity of pegcetacoplan does not depend upon the activation of any particular complement pathway.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Development 
 We initiated the Phase 3 DERBY and OAKS trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravitreal pegcetacoplan in patients with GA secondary to AMD in September 2018. In September 2021, we reported top-line results from our DERBY and OAKS trials, followed by additional analyses presented at multiple medical meetings in October and November of 2021. In July 2018, we received fast track designation from the FDA for pegcetacoplan in GA. In August 2017, we completed the primary endpoint analysis for the 12-month treatment period for the Phase 2 FILLY trial and in February 2018 we completed the analysis of data from the six-month post-treatment monitoring period from that trial. Prior to the FILLY trial, we completed a Phase 1 trial of pegcetacoplan in patients with wet AMD in 2016. 
Phase 3 Clinical Trials
 Our ongoing Phase 3 clinical program in GA consists of two prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-injection controlled trials (DERBY and OAKS) being conducted at 200 sites worldwide to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple intravitreal injections of pegcetacoplan in patients with GA. We enrolled 621 patients in DERBY and 637 patients in OAKS.
 Patients in each Phase 3 trial receive a dose of 15 mg of pegcetacoplan injected intravitreally in a 0.1 cc volume, monthly or every other month for 24 months. In the sham-injection cohorts, patients receive a simulated injection. As with our Phase 2 FILLY clinical trial, the primary endpoint of each trial was the change in total area of GA lesions in the study eye from baseline to month 12 compared to sham. The measurements of change in lesion size was analyzed at 12 months (primary endpoint, monthly group) and will be analyzed at 24 months. We set statistical significance as a p-value of 0.05 or less, meaning that there is a 1 in 20 or less probability that the observed results occurred by chance. Patients who develop new onset exudation in the study eye continued to be treated with pegcetacoplan along with anti-VEGF injections, the current standard of care for wet AMD.  
 
We completed the primary endpoint analysis for the 12-month treatment period in September 2021. Monthly and every-other-month treatment with intravitreal pegcetacoplan met the primary endpoint in OAKS, significantly reducing GA lesion growth by 22% (p=0.0003) and 16% (p=0.0052), respectively, compared to pooled sham at 12 months. Monthly and every-other-month treatment with pegcetacoplan did not meet the primary endpoint in DERBY, showing a reduction in GA lesion growth of 12% (p=0.0528) and 11% (p=0.0750), respectively, compared to pooled sham at 12 months. In a prespecified analysis of the combined DERBY and OAKS studies, monthly and every-other-month treatment with pegcetacoplan reduced GA lesion growth by 17% (p<0.0001) and 14% (p=0.0012), respectively, compared to pooled sham at 12 months.

In a prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint, pegcetacoplan demonstrated a greater effect in patients with extrafoveal lesions at baseline. Patients with GA typically present first with extrafoveal lesions, which then progress toward the fovea where central vision is impacted. Under the prespecified analysis, in the combined studies, monthly and every-other-month treatment with pegcetacoplan decreased GA lesion growth by 26% (p<0.0001) and 23% (p=0.0002), respectively, in patients with extrafoveal lesions compared to pooled sham at 12 months. 
 Intravitreal pegcetacoplan was well-tolerated in both DERBY and OAKS. The pooled rate of new-onset exudations was 6.0% of patients in the monthly treatment groups, 4.1% in the every-other-month treatment groups, and 2.4% in the sham groups. Consistent with our Phase 2 FILLY trial, we defined and reported exudations as all adverse events of exudative AMD that were reported by the investigator, regardless of whether there was confirmation from the reading center. Two cases of confirmed infectious endophthalmitis and one case of suspected infectious endophthalmitis were observed in the study eye out of a total of 6,322 injections (0.047%). Rates of endophthalmitis and intraocular inflammation were generally in line with those reported in studies of other intravitreal therapies. Fourteen events of intraocular inflammation, including one event of non-infectious endophthalmitis, were observed in the studies (0.22% per injection). No events of retinal vasculitis or retinal vein occlusion were observed. There were no clinically relevant changes in vision for patients who developed infectious endophthalmitis or intraocular inflammation. 
 We expect to report additional 18-month safety and efficacy data in March 2022 and 24-month data, including the functional secondary endpoints, during the third quarter of 2022.

We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second quarter of 2022 with a request for six-month priority review, based on the results from DERBY, OAKS and FILLY, and the feedback from the FDA on our regulatory strategy. We completed a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in January 2022. We plan to begin pre-submission disclosures to the EMA in the first quarter of 2022 andto submit an MAA to the EMA in the second half of 2022. 
 We are using a liquid formulation of pegcetacoplan in our Phase 3 trials instead of the freeze-dried formulation that we used in the Phase 2 FILLY trial, which we believe may reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis.
 In October 2018, we announced that we voluntarily implemented a pause in dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with GA due to observed cases of non-infectious inflammation in patients treated from a single manufacturing lot of pegcetacoplan intravitreal drug product. Four patients in the Phase 3 GA program were treated with pegcetacoplan from this manufacturing lot and each patient developed non-infectious inflammation. Inflammation in all patients completely resolved. We reviewed these events with the data safety monitoring board for our GA trials, conducted a series of non-human studies and introduced improvements to the manufacturing process. Based on these efforts, we believe that the source of inflammation resided in a contaminant or impurity in the active pharmaceutical ingredient. We resumed the trials in March 2019.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial 
 In the third quarter of 2015, we initiated FILLY, our Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham-controlled clinical trial of intravitreal pegcetacoplan in patients with GA, at more than 40 clinical sites primarily located in the United States. We enrolled 246 patients in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive pegcetacoplan monthly, pegcetacoplan every other month, sham injection monthly or sham injection every other month. Patients in the pegcetacoplan arms received a dose of 15 mg of pegcetacoplan injected intravitreally in a 0.1 cc volume, monthly or every other month for 12 months followed by six months of monitoring without treatment. In the sham-injection cohorts, patients received a simulated injection. Study eyes received up to 13 injections in the monthly arm, and up to seven injections in the every-other-month arm. Eyes were evaluated for GA at the end of months two, six, 12 and 18. 
 We conducted this trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and evidence of activity of multiple intravitreal injections of pegcetacoplan in patients with GA in at least one eye. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the square root of GA lesion size from baseline to month 12 in each treatment arm when compared to sham in the modified intent to treat population, which included 84 patients receiving administration of pegcetacoplan every month, 78 patients receiving administration of pegcetacoplan every other month and 80 patients in the group receiving sham injections. The primary safety endpoint was the number and severity of local and systemic treatment emergent adverse events. The trial was monitored by a safety monitoring committee. 
 We announced 12-month results of the Phase 2 trial in August 2017. After 12 months, patients treated monthly with pegcetacoplan showed a 29% reduction in the rate of GA lesion growth compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.008, and patients treated every other month showed a 20% reduction compared to sham, with a p-value of 0.067. The rate of GA lesion growth in the sham was consistent with the rate of lesion growth in patients with GA in third-party historical studies. 
 After the 12-month treatment period, patients were monitored for a further six months without treatment. During the monitoring period, the GA lesions in the previously treated groups grew at a rate similar to sham but the treatment effect was maintained for the full 18 months. Patients who received monthly pegcetacoplan, and for whom images were available at 12 and 18 months showed a 12% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the six-month monitoring period compared to sham, while patients who received every other month administration of pegcetacoplan showed a 9% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the six-month monitoring period compared to sham. These differences are not considered to be statistically significant. In the modified intent to treat population over the full 18-month period, patients who received monthly pegcetacoplan showed a 20% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the full 18-month period compared to sham, while patients who received every other month administration of pegcetacoplan showed a 16% reduction in the growth rate of lesions over the full 18-month period compared to sham.
 The most frequently reported adverse events in the trial were associated with the injection procedure in the study eye. These adverse events included two cases of confirmed endophthalmitis and one case of presumed endophthalmitis where the culture tested negative for bacterial growth. In the latter case, the patient fully recovered visual acuity. In our Phase 2 trial, we observed an incidence rate of endophthalmitis of 0.21% per injection. 
 In addition, during the 12-month treatment period and the six-month monitoring period, we observed a higher incidence of new onset exudation in the study eyes treated with pegcetacoplan as compared to sham, predominantly in patients with a history of wet AMD in the fellow eye. Specifically, we observed that, after the 12-month treatment period and the six-month monitoring period, 18 patients (21%) receiving administration of pegcetacoplan every month and seven patients (9%) receiving administration of pegcetacoplan every other month showed new onset exudation in the study eye, as compared to one patient (1%) in the sham group. 
 10

Patients who experienced new onset exudation in the study eye were discontinued from treatment with pegcetacoplan and, in all but one case, treated with standard of care anti-VEGF injections under supervision. There was no meaningful negative impact on visual acuity resulting from the new onset exudations.
 Phase 1b Clinical Trial in Low Vision Geography Atrophy
 In September 2018, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety of monthly intravitreal treatments with pegcetacoplan in 12 patients with bilateral GA secondary to AMD and with low vision. Patients were dosed monthly with pegcetacoplan in one eye using the fellow eye as an untreated control. In April 2020, we reported results in patients demonstrating a trend in reduced GA lesion growth in treated eyes versus the lesion growth in untreated fellow eyes. In October 2020, we reported data from an 18-month post hoc analysis based on the seven study patients for whom data were available for at least 18 months. In this population, the growth rate of GA lesions in the treated eye was on average 52% (mean square root) slower than the untreated fellow eye (p=0.01). Of the 12 enrolled patients, there were no reported cases of inflammation and one patient (8%) developed new-onset exudation at month 12.
Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial in Wet AMD
 In the second quarter of 2018, we conducted a Phase 1b/2, multi-center, open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety of intravitreal pegcetacoplan therapy when administered in parallel with anti-VEGF treatments in patients with wet AMD in the study eye. As with our Phase 3 program in GA, we voluntarily implemented a pause in our Phase 1b/2 trial of pegcetacoplan in patients with wet AMD in October 2018. We discontinued the Phase 1b/2 trial of pegcetacoplan in patients with wet AMD. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
 We conducted a Phase 1 open label, ascending single-dose clinical trial of pegcetacoplan administered by intravitreal injection in patients with wet AMD who were receiving anti-VEGF therapy. We conducted the trial at multiple clinical sites both within and outside the United States to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pegcetacoplan. In this trial, patients received a single dose of pegcetacoplan by intravitreal injection followed by 113 days of monitoring. We enrolled 18 patients in the trial, in three cohorts, at doses of 5 mg (3 patients), 10 mg (3 patients) and 20 mg (12 patients) of pegcetacoplan. Pegcetacoplan was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. 
Preclinical Studies 
 We have conducted preclinical studies to assess the safety of pegcetacoplan injected intravitreally. A full toxicological review, including histopathological examinations of both eyes and of multiple additional tissues revealed no evidence of pegcetacoplan -related toxicity changes at any of the doses tested. 
 Intermediate AMD (iAMD)
 
Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe that pivotal studies in iAMD would involve a large number of patients over an extended period of time, and therefore, we have decided to deprioritize our development program in iAMD for now. This decision does not minimize our view of the unmet need in this disease or the benefit of pegcetacoplan as a potential treatment.
 GA + Wet AMD
 
We plan to submit an IND application for APL-2006, a bispecific C3 and VEGF inhibitor, in the first half of 2023. There are currently a high proportion of patients who are currently living with advanced forms of AMD, including both GA and wet AMD, and we believe APL-2006 has the potential to benefit these patients.
 
We have exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of intravitreal pegcetacoplan and for APL-2006.
 Rare Disease
 Together with Sobi, we are developing systemic pegcetacoplan in multiple late-stage programs in rare disease indications across hematology, nephrology, and neurology. We are leading the clinical development for the treatment of C3G/IC-MPGN and ALS, and Sobi is leading the clinical development for the treatment of CAD and HSCT-TMA. In PNH, we and Sobi have now obtained approval of systemic pegcetacoplan in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union.

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)
 Background 
 PNH is a rare, chronic, debilitating blood disorder that is most frequently acquired in early adulthood and usually continues throughout the life of the patient. Some of the prominent symptoms of PNH include severe anemia, a condition that results from having too few red blood cells, severe abdominal pain, severe headaches, back pain, excessive weakness, fatigue and recurrent infections. If not treated, PNH results in the death of approximately 35% of affected individuals within five years of diagnosis and 50% of affected individuals within ten years of diagnosis, primarily due to the formation of life-threatening blood clots inside the blood vessels, or thrombosis. Based on prevalence data published in an abstract in a peer-reviewed journal, we estimate that there are approximately 4,700 patients with PNH in the United States and approximately 15,000 patients with PNH worldwide. 
 PNH is caused by the presence of mutant stem cells in the bone marrow that lack important proteins on their surface that protect against activation of the complement system. In patients with PNH, an autoimmune response targets and eliminates normal stem cells, enabling mutant cells to become dominant in the bone marrow. These mutant stem cells lead to mutant platelets and red blood cells that, unlike normal cells, are overly susceptible to activation or destruction by the complement system. Mutant platelets, activated by the membrane attack complex, increase the risk of thrombosis, which is the leading cause of mortality in patients with PNH. Mutant red blood cells are susceptible to destruction by intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. Intravascular hemolysis, which involves the destruction of blood cells within the blood vessels, is caused by the formation of the membrane attack complex on the surface of red blood cells causing them to rupture. Intravascular hemolysis causes severe anemia and contributes to the risk of thrombosis. Extravascular hemolysis, which involves the destruction of blood cells outside the blood vessels, is caused by C3-related opsonization on red blood cells leading to removal of the cells from the blood stream by the liver and the spleen. Extravascular hemolysis further contributes to severe anemia and transfusion dependency in patients with PNH.
 Current Therapies and Their Limitations 
 Eculizumab and ravulizumab are C5 inhibitors marketed by AstraZeneca Rare Disease, or AstraZeneca, and were the only therapies approved for the treatment of PNH prior to the approval of EMPAVELI. Eculizumab, which is administered every two weeks intravenously, or directly into the veins, is designed to treat PNH by targeting C5 and preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex and intravascular hemolysis. Many patients with PNH on treatment with eculizumab continue to be anemic. Ravulizumab is administered intravenously every week and subcutaneously once per week and is designed to have a longer half-life and greater inhibition of C5 than eculizumab. Ravulizumab was tested in two Phase 3 non-inferiority trials with eculizumab and was found to be non-inferior to eculizumab.
 Retrospective third-party studies have reported that up to 70% of patients with PNH who are on treatment with eculizumab remained anemic and up to 36% of patients continuing to require at least one transfusion per year. In these studies, 100% of patients with PNH on eculizumab showed evidence of C3-related opsonization on their red blood cells. We believe that uncontrolled extravascular hemolysis is responsible in part for these continuing complications. 
 Benefits of Our Approach 
 We believe that because systemic pegcetacoplan inhibits complement activation at the level of C3, and based on the results from our Phase 3 PEGASUS and PRINCE studies, systemic pegcetacoplan provides the following benefits in controlling PNH: 

• | Prevention of intravascular hemolysis and its consequences. Systemic pegcetacoplan may prevent the formation of the membrane attack complex on blood cells and thereby prevents the activation of mutant platelets and intravascular hemolysis, thus reducing the risk of thrombosis, the leading cause of mortality in PNH, as well as reducing anemia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prevention of extravascular hemolysis and its consequences. Systemic pegcetacoplan may prevent C3b opsonization, on blood cells, and thereby prevents extravascular hemolysis, further reducing anemia and transfusion dependency in patients with PNH.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease and convenience of use. The ability to self-administer pegcetacoplan by subcutaneous injection on a regular basis, which may improve the quality of life for patients with PNH by eliminating the need to travel to a health care facility for intravenous treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Matters
 We submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for systemic pegcetacoplan for the treatment of PNH in September 2020. In May 2021, systemic pegcetacoplan was approved by the FDA with the brand name EMPAVELI for the treatment of adult patients with PNH. In December 2021, the EC approved systemic pegcetacoplan with the brand name Aspaveli for the treatment of adults with PNH who are anemic after treatment with a C5 inhibitor for at least three months. In January 2022, pegcetacoplan was also approved as EMPAVELI in Saudi Arabia and Australia. Under our agreement with Sobi, we are eligible for a $50.0 million milestone 
 12

payment from Sobi upon first European regulatory approval, which was obtained in December 2021, and reimbursement approval, which has not yet been obtained. We expect to receive this milestone payment from Sobi in the first half of 2022. 
 Clinical Development 
 We believe that systemic pegcetacoplan is a best-in-class therapy for PNH, differentiated by mechanism, and that it has the potential to significantly increase the quality of life of patients with PNH as compared to the current standard of care. 
Phase 3 Clinical Trial - PEGASUS
 We initiated the Phase 3 PEGASUS trial in patients in June 2018. The PEGASUS trial was an 80-patient randomized head-to-head trial comparing systemic pegcetacoplan monotherapy to eculizumab monotherapy in patients with PNH currently on treatment with eculizumab who have a hemoglobin level of less than 10.5 g/dL, regarding of eculizumab dose or transfusion history. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was the change in hemoglobin level from baseline at week 16. 
 The treatment period of the trial consisted of three parts: a four-week run-in period, a 16-week randomized treatment period and a 32-week open-label pegcetacoplan only period. During the run-in period, all patients received twice-weekly subcutaneous doses of 1,080 mg of pegcetacoplan in addition to patients’ then current dose of eculizumab. The run-in period was designed to provide patients with sufficient plasma concentration of pegcetacoplan to provide for what we expected to be adequate complement inhibition before withdrawing eculizumab. Following completion of the run-in period, patients received either 1,080 mg of pegcetacoplan twice per week or their current dose of eculizumab through the duration of the 16-week randomized treatment period. Following completion of the randomized treatment period with either pegcetacoplan monotherapy or eculizumab monotherapy, all 80 patients had the option to receive pegcetacoplan monotherapy for 32 weeks in an open-label treatment period.
In January 2020, we announced top-line data from the PEGASUS trial that showed that systemic pegcetacoplan met the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating superiority to eculizumab with a statistically significant improvement in adjusted means of 3.8 g/dL of hemoglobin at week 16 (p < 0.0001). At week 16, pegcetacoplan-treated patients (n = 41) had an adjusted mean hemoglobin increase of 2.4 g/dL from a baseline of 8.7 g/dL, compared to eculizumab-treated patients (n = 39) who had a change of -1.5 g/dL from a baseline of 8.7 g/dL. Additionally, pegcetacoplan showed promising results in key secondary endpoints. Pegcetacoplan met non-inferiority on transfusion avoidance and absolute reticulocyte count. Pegcetacoplan did not meet pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority on mean LDH levels. Pegcetacoplan showed positive trends on LDH and fatigue as measured by the FACIT-fatigue score. The statistical analysis plan for the PEGASUS trial provided for use of the mixed model—repeated measures (MMRM) method. To avoid the effect of transfusions in hemoglobin levels during the 16-week randomization period of the trial, if a patient received a transfusion during the 16-week randomization period, any measurements after the first transfusion were censored from the data used in the MMRM analysis. The treatment effects using observed data from the trial, which included all post-transfusion measurements, were consistent with and supportive of the reported results from the MMRM analysis.
 All patients who completed the 16-week randomization period in both groups (77/80) entered the 32-week open-label pegcetacoplan treatment period. At week 48, patients treated with pegcetacoplan during the 16-week randomization period and through the 32-week open-label period sustained increases in hemoglobin levels, with a mean improvement from baseline of 2.7 g/dL, equal to the 2.7 g/dL mean increase seen at week 16 in the same patients. Additionally, patients treated with eculizumab in the randomized period who switched to pegcetacoplan during the open-label period experienced sustained improvements in hemoglobin and other hematological and clinical measures, similar to patients treated with pegcetacoplan monotherapy during the randomized controlled period. In addition to a sustained improvement in hemoglobin, the pegcetacoplan-treated patients group maintained improvements across key secondary endpoints. Throughout the 48-week study, 73% of patients treated with pegcetacoplan during the randomized period remained transfusion free. For comparison, 25% of patients were transfusion free over the year prior to entering the PEGASUS study while on treatment with eculizumab. Improvements across additional markers of disease, such as reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH, levels, and the FACIT-fatigue scores, were observed in both groups at week 48 after 32 weeks of open-label treatment with pegcetacoplan.
  In the PEGASUS trial, the safety profile of systemic pegcetacoplan was comparable to eculizumab and consistent with previously reported data. After the 48-week study period, twenty-four of 80 pegcetacoplan monotherapy-treated patients (30%) experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). Five of the SAEs (6%) were assessed to be possibly related to study treatment. No cases of meningitis were reported. One death was reported due to COVID-19 and was unrelated to study treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) reported throughout the study were injection site reactions (36%), hemolysis (24%), and diarrhea (21%). Twelve out of 80 patients (15%) discontinued due to adverse events, with five discontinuations due to hemolysis. Sixty-four of the 67 patients (96%) who completed the open-label period opted to enter the extension study.

 Phase 3 Clinical Trial – PRINCE
We initiated the Phase 3 PRINCE trial in September 2019. The PRINCE trial was a 54-patient randomized, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy of systemic pegcetacoplan in treatment-naïve PNH patients. The primary endpoints were avoidance of a greater than 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level from baseline in the absence of transfusion through week 26 and reduction in LDH level from baseline to week 26, in patients with PNH who are currently not being treated with complement inhibitors. Secondary endpoints included hemoglobin response (defined as an increase in hemoglobin levels greater than or equal to 1 g/dL), change in absolute reticulocyte count, change in hemoglobin levels, number of packed red blood cells transfused, change in FACIT score, hemoglobin normalization and LDH normalization. 
 In May 2021, we reported top-line results from PRINCE demonstrating statistical superiority on the co-primary endpoints of hemoglobin stabilization and reduction in LDH compared to standard of care, which did not include complement inhibitors, at week 26. Specifically, 86% of EMPAVELI-treated patients achieved hemoglobin stabilization compared to 0% of patients on standard of care (p<0.0001). Hemoglobin stabilization was defined as an avoidance of a >1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions. Additionally, mean LDH in the EMPAVELI group decreased by 90% from a baseline of 2151 U/L, which is 9.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), to 211 U/L, which is within the normal range, compared to a 14% reduction on standard of care from a baseline of 1946 U/L to 1681 U/L (p<0.0001).
 EMPAVELI also achieved statistical superiority on several secondary endpoints, including improvements in hemoglobin levels and transfusion avoidance, compared to standard of care, which did not include complement inhibitors. Mean hemoglobin levels in the EMPAVELI group increased from 9.4 g/dL to 12.1 g/dL compared to an increase from a baseline of 8.7 g/dL to 9.4 g/dL on standard of care (p=0.0019). Further, 91% of patients on EMPAVELI avoided transfusions compared to 6% on standard of care (p<0.0001).
 Phase 1b Clinical Trials – PHAROAH and PADDOCK
 Prior to commencing our two Phase 3 trials, we conducted two clinical trials of systemic pegcetacoplan as part of our PNH program: a Phase 1b clinical trial (PHAROAH) in patients with PNH being treated with eculizumab, which has concluded, and a Phase 1b clinical trial (PADDOCK) in treatment-naïve patients. These trials were designed to assess safety and tolerability and whether pegcetacoplan has the potential to control PNH. In these trials, we measured hemoglobin levels, which are significantly lower in patients with PNH, whether or not treated with eculizumab, and blood reticulocyte count, which is an indicator of overall hemolysis (both intravascular and extravascular) in patients on eculizumab. We also measured intravascular hemolysis based on LDH levels, which can be ten times higher than normal in patients with PNH, bilirubin, which is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and may be higher in patients who experience hemolysis, and the clonal distributions of normal red blood cells and mutant red blood cells unprotected from the membrane attack complex. 
 PHAROAH was a Phase 1b open-label, single and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of systemic pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH who are receiving eculizumab, conducted at multiple clinical sites in the United States. In the PHAROAH trial, doses of pegcetacoplan were administered by subcutaneous injection to patients with PNH who were concurrently being treated with eculizumab at varying doses according to the treating physicians’ recommendations. We treated a total of nine patients in the PHAROAH trial. Pegcetacoplan was generally well tolerated by the patients in the trial with 12 serious adverse events reported across three patients. Only one of these serious adverse events was noted as possibly related to the administration of pegcetacoplan. We initiated this trial in February 2015 and the last patient transitioned in October 2018 into a long-term extension study that we are conducting. 
 PADDOCK was a Phase 1b open-label clinical trial of systemic pegcetacoplan in treatment-naïve patients with PNH that we initiated in December 2015 and conducted this trial at multiple clinical sites outside of the United States. In the PADDOCK trial, doses of pegcetacoplan were initially administered by subcutaneous injection during the treatment period. We treated a total of 22 patients in the PADDOCK trial. Pegcetacoplan had been generally well tolerated in these patients with 13 serious adverse events reported across seven patients. Only one of these serious adverse events was noted as possibly related to administration of pegcetacoplan.
 Long-Term Extension Study
 We are conducting a long-term extension study of systemic pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH who participated in previous clinical trials with pegcetacoplan. This study is an open label, non-randomized, multi-center study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of pegcetacoplan in the treatment of PNH with dosing for a longer period and at doses of 1,080 mg given either twice a week or every three days. We expect to continue the extension study until pegcetacoplan becomes commercially available in the subject’s participating country, or until the development program for pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH is terminated.

Phase 1 Clinical Trials—Single and Multiple Ascending Dose in Healthy Volunteers
We have completed both a single ascending and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of systemic pegcetacoplan in a total of 55 healthy volunteers. We conducted the trials at a single site in Australia to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, of pegcetacoplan. Pegcetacoplan was well tolerated in both trials with no serious adverse events reported, and the PK of pegcetacoplan in humans was in line with our expectations derived from preclinical data, with little inter-subject variability observed. In both trials, we observed a dose-dependent increase in C3 that is indicative of pegcetacoplan binding to C3. 
 Supporting Clinical Trials and Studies 
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of systemic pegcetacoplan in patients with renal impairment. The study included one cohort of eight patients with severe renal impairment and a second cohort of eight control patients and will evaluate various PK endpoints, in addition to safety and tolerability endpoints. No significant difference in PK parameters was noted.
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to determine the safety, PK and PD of twice-weekly and once-weekly subcutaneous administration of pegcetacoplan in healthy volunteers. We evaluated whether less frequent administration provides comparable PK and PD profiles to daily subcutaneous administration and may enable less frequent dosing in upcoming clinical trials. We established the dosing regimen in PEGASUS and PRINCE based on this trial.
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to determine the safety, PK and PD of pegcetacoplan in healthy volunteers of Japanese descent. We evaluated whether pegcetacoplan will have comparable PK and PD profiles in this population. No significant difference in PK parameters was noted.
 Safety
 In all trials of pegcetacoplan administered systemically by subcutaneous injection, we have monitored the safety of our targeting of C3 closely. Individuals who lack functional levels of C3 or C5 have been shown to be susceptible to infection by certain bacterial species, including Neisseria meningitidis in C5-deficient individuals and Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in C3-deficient individuals. As a result, we vaccinate patients in these trials against these three pathogens, which we believe minimizes the risk of infection. 
 
Through January 2022, systemic pegcetacoplan has been administered to 313 subjects with approximately 420 patient-years of exposure in the clinical trial setting, and, since commercial launch in May 2021, to approximately 120 patients with approximately 50 patient-years of exposure in the post-marketing setting. No unexpected safety concerns have been observed in any of these patients.
 Small interfering RNA, or siRNA + EMPAVELI
 We plan to submit an IND for the combination of EMPAVELI and a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, in the first half of 2023. This combination may offer the potential to reduce the treatment frequency of EMPAVELI by reducing the production of C3 proteins by the liver.
 Commercial and Medical Activities for PNH Launch
 We launched EMPAVELI in the United States for patients with PNH following its approval by the FDA in May 2021. We believe that with EMPAVELI we can elevate the standard of care for patients and are seeking to further establish EMPAVELI as first-line treatment. We have demonstrated strong progress to date. Between launch through December 31, 2021, we generated net product revenue of $15.1 million.
 Our sales team is covering the health care professionals, or HCPs, and key treatment centers, focusing on HCPs who have patients that continue to experience breakthrough hemolysis, have persistently low hemoglobin, high fatigue, and require transfusions despite being on C5 inhibitors. The team is engaging both in-person and virtually with HCPs, closely monitoring regional COVID-19 restrictions and pursuing in-person engagements when able to and in compliance with appropriate guidelines.   
 Our market access team is engaging with primary and secondary payers representing a significant percentage of PNH patients. Our discussions with primary and secondary payers have yielded positive feedback on the clinical profile of pegcetacoplan and resulted in EMPAVELI being added to several positive formulary positions. We implemented a limited distribution specialty pharmacy model, which we believe provided patients with a consistent, positive experience at the time of treatment initiation and long-term assistance to the extent needed. 
 15

We also established Apellis Assist, a patient-focused program specifically designed to assist patients with onboarding, product training and ongoing support with pegcetacoplan treatment, and have built a care educator team to connect directly with PNH patients and their caregivers to provide education and training on the use of pegcetacoplan. 
 We are developing ENABLE, a custom, on-body drug delivery system that would enable patients to self-administer pegcetacoplan through subcutaneous infusion. While this device is in development, we are using one or more commercially available ambulatory infusion pumps for commercial use of pegcetacoplan as a treatment for PNH.
 Our medical affairs team is engaging with physicians, either in-person or virtually, and through our presence at medical meetings and other in-person engagements when appropriate. In December 2021, we participated in the American Hematology Society, or ASH, annual meeting. We will continue to leverage this platform for future medical congresses. We have initiated an early access program and have already established multiple U.S. sites for patients. Sobi will conduct medical affairs activities for systemic pegcetacoplan outside the United States.
 C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) and Immune Complex Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN)
 C3G and IC-MPGN are rare, debilitating kidney diseases that affect approximately 18,000 people in the United States and Europe. There are no approved therapies for the diseases, and symptoms include blood in the urine, dark foamy urine due to the presence of protein, swelling, and high blood pressure. Approximately 50% of people living with C3G and IC-MPGN ultimately suffer kidney failure within five to 10 years of diagnosis.  Although IC-MPGN is considered a distinct disease from C3G, the underlying cause and progression of the two diseases are remarkably similar and include overactivation of the complement cascade, with excessive accumulation of C3 breakdown products in the kidney causing inflammation and damage to the organ. There are no medicines currently approved for C3G or IC-MPGN. Pegcetacoplan is designed to prevent C3 activation, and as such, we believe it has the potential to prevent further deposition of C3 activation products in the glomeruli, which may protect the kidney from further injury. In December 2018, systemic pegcetacoplan received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of C3G.
 In February 2018, we initiated DISCOVERY, a Phase 2 clinical trial of systemic pegcetacoplan in biopsy-proven C3G and other glomerular diseases in which complement has been implicated, including IgA nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis, to evaluate the safety and biologic activity of pegcetacoplan in patients with these glomerular diseases. Initially each patient received once daily subcutaneous infusions of up to 360 mg of pegcetacoplan for one year, but patients could elect to receive twice weekly subcutaneous infusions of 1080 mg after week 24. The primary efficacy endpoint was the reduction in proteinuria, an important market of kidney damage, from baseline to week 48 as quantified by protein-to-creatinine ratio, or uPCR. Based on the scientific literature as well as the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, we believe that a substantial change in proteinuria is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit in all four glomerular diseases. Secondary endpoints included analysis of serum C3 and estimated glomerular filtration rate.   
 In October 2020, we reported data from the DISCOVERY trial in five C3G patients treated with systemic pegcetacoplan for 48 weeks.  In those patients, mean (SE) proteinuria decreased from 3.48 (0.82) mg/mg at baseline to 0.93 (0.27) mg/mg at week 48, a decrease of 73.3%, as measured by 24-hour uPCR. Importantly, this reduction in proteinuria was accompanied by a corresponding increase in mean serum albumin. Since albumin is the most abundant protein in serum, its level increases when urinary protein losses are reduced. Other biomarkers improved, including an observed increase in mean serum C3 and stabilization of renal function, as measured by mean serum creatinine. No serious or severe adverse events were reported, and pegcetacoplan was well tolerated overall.
 In September 2021, we initiated our registrational program in C3G and IC-MPGN with our NOBLE trial, a randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial in 12 patients with post-transplant disease recurrence that focused on the histopathology of the kidneys. Trial participants are randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive pegcetacoplan or maintain standard of care for 12 weeks and then all patients in the study will receive pegcetacoplan from week 13 to week 52. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients with reduction in C3c staining on renal biopsy after 12 weeks of treatment with pegcetacoplan. Secondary endpoints include an evaluation of safety, the proportion of patients with reduction in C3c staining on renal biopsy after 52 weeks of treatment, and the proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in proteinuria.

We expect to dose our first patient in our Phase 3 VALIANT trial in the first half of 2022. VALIANT is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center Phase 3 trial being conducted in approximately 90 patients who are 12 years of age and older with primary IC-MPGN or C3G. VALIANT is the only study to include both native kidney patients and patients who have recurrent disease after receiving a kidney transplant. 
Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD)
 CAD is a severe, chronic, rare blood disorder that impacts about 10,500 people across the United States and Europe. People living with CAD may suffer from chronic anemia, transfusion requirements, and an increased risk of life-threatening thrombotic 
 16

events such as stroke. In people with CAD, immunoglobin M (IgM) autoantibodies cause red blood cells to agglutinate, or clump together, at temperatures below 30oC or as a result of a compromised immune system or infection This activates the complement cascade to destroy healthy red blood cells through extravascular and intravascular hemolysis. In February 2022, the FDA granted approval for sutimlimab-jome, which was developed by Sanofi as a treatment for patients with CAD. The primary and secondary therapies, which include corticosteroids, splenectomy, alkylating agents and immunosuppressive drugs, are associated with low response rates, relapses and clinically significant adverse effects
 
We believe that C3 inhibition has the potential to prevent C3-related opsonization and extravascular hemolysis in patients with CAD, and that inhibiting the complement system by targeting C3 may have the same impact, if not greater, as other complement pathway drugs in these diseases. Sobi expects to dose the first patient in its Phase 3 trial in the first half of 2022.
 In February 2022, the FDA granted approval for sutimlimab-jome to decease the need for red blood cell transfusions due to hemolysis in adults with CAD.  Sutimlimab-jome was developed by Sanofi as a treatment for patients with CAD. Other primary and secondary therapies, which include corticosteroids, splenectomy, alkylating agents and immunosuppressive drugs, are associated with low response rates, relapses and clinically significant adverse effects.
 In March 2018, we initiated PLAUDIT, our Phase 2 open label clinical trial of systemic pegcetacoplan administered by subcutaneous injection in patients with CAD. In the PLAUDIT trial, doses of pegcetacoplan were initially administered by subcutaneous injection during the treatment period, followed by a long-term extension period. In December 2018, we announced interim data for the Phase 2 trial at the ASH Conference and further interim data at the European Hematology Association Congress in June 2019. We observed that in the 10 patients with CAD who reached day 168: 
  
• | 70% showed a Hb increase of ≥ 2 g/dL, 40% had normalized Hb (≥ 12.0 g/dL) and 80% had Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL at Day 168
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean Hb increased from 8.9 g/dL at baseline to 11.2 g/dL at Day 168, a 2.4 g/dL increase (normal Hb is 12 - 16 g/dL)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Score increased from 29.4 at baseline to 39.1 at Day 168, an improvement of 9.7 points, where a clinically significant increase is 3 or more points
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) decreased from 138.6 X 10⁹/L at baseline to 63.6 X 10⁹/L at Day 168 (normal ARC is 30 - 100 X 10⁹/L)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean indirect bilirubin decreased from 1.9 mg/dL at baseline to 0.4 mg/dL at Day 168 (normal indirect bilirubin is 0.1 -0.75 mg/dL)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mean LDH decreased from 486.5 U/L at baseline to 183.2 U/L at Day 168 (normal LDH is 87 - 252 U/L)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Systemic pegcetacoplan was generally well tolerated in these patients in the PLAUDIT trial, with a safety profile similar to that of other studies of systemic administration of pegcetacoplan.
 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Thrombotic Microangiopathy
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation thrombotic microangiopathy, or HSCT-TMA, is rare blood disease that can be a fatal complication of a bone marrow transplant or HSCT. In HSCT-TMA, microscopic blood clots form in small blood vessels, leading to organ damage. The kidneys are commonly affected, although any organ may be involved. HSCT-TMA occurs in up to 40% of HSCT recipients; every year, there are approximately 9,000 allogeneic transplants in the United States and approximately 18,000 in the European Union.  Excessive complement activation is a high-risk feature in patients with HSCT-TMA, and C3 is believed to play a critical role in TMA based on proinflammatory and procoagulant properties of C3a and C3b.
 In early 2022, Sobi dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 clinical trial of systemic pegcetacoplan in patients with HSCT-TMA.
 Neurology
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
 We are also developing systemic pegcetacoplan for the treatment of ALS.
 ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive muscle weakness and paralysis due to the death of nerve cells, called motor neurons, in the brain and spinal cord. The death of motor neurons leads to the progressive loss of voluntary muscle movement required for speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing. In individuals with ALS, high levels of C3 are present at the neuromuscular junction where motor neurons communicate directly to muscle cells. Numerous studies suggest that elevated levels of C3 present throughout the motor system of ALS patients are likely to contribute to chronic neuroinflammation and the 
 17

death of motor neurons. There are currently no approved treatments that stop or reverse the progression of ALS, which impacts approximately 225,000 patients worldwide.
 In November 2020, we dosed our first patient in MERIDIAN, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic pegcetacoplan in approximately 200 adults with sporadic ALS. Trial participants are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive pegcetacoplan or placebo while continuing to receive their existing standard of care treatment for ALS. After 52 weeks of blinded treatment, all patients in the study will receive pegcetacoplan. To reduce the burden on people living with ALS and their caregivers, the study has been designed to minimize the number of in-clinic visits, with approximately six clinic visits in the first year and four in the open-label second year.  The primary endpoint of this trial is the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) rank scores at week 52. We expect to complete enrollment in MERIDIAN in the first half of 2022.
 Neurodegenerative Diseases
 Additionally, we are developing APL-1030, a novel, first-in-class C3 inhibitor designed to be administered to the brain intrathecally with the potential to treat multiple neurodegenerative diseases. We intend to submit an IND for APL-1030 in the second half of 2022.
Other Research
 On June 30, 2021, we entered into an exclusive five-year research collaboration with Beam focused on the use of Beam’s proprietary base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement-driven diseases. Under the collaboration agreement, we are collaborating on up to six research programs focused on C3 and other complement targets in the eye, liver and brain. 
 
In March 2021, we announced that we will no longer pursue additional development of APL-9 for the treatment of severe COVID-19.
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Sobi
 In October 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Sobi concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmic administration, or Licensed Products. The agreement does not cover pegcetacoplan or other compstatin analogues or derivatives used for non-systemic ophthalmic administration or APL-9. 
 Under the agreement, we granted Sobi an exclusive (subject to certain rights retained by us), sublicensable license under certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize Licensed Products in all countries outside of the United States.
 We retained the right to commercialize Licensed Products in the United States, and, subject to specified limitations, to develop Licensed Products worldwide for commercialization in the United States.
 Under the agreement, we and Sobi have agreed to collaborate to develop Licensed Products for the treatment of PNH, CAD, HSCT-TMA, C3G, IC-MPGN and ALS, or the “Initial Indications”, and any other indications subsequently agreed upon by the parties, for commercialization by or on our behalf in the United States and by or on behalf of Sobi outside of the United States. If the parties do not agree to jointly pursue any development activities for the Licensed Products (whether for an Initial Indication or otherwise), the party proposing to pursue such activities may conduct such activities at its sole expense (with the non-proposing party having the right to obtain rights to the data generated by such development activities by paying a specified percentage of that expense), subject to agreed-upon exceptions that limit each party’s unilateral development rights.
 The initial development plan sets forth the initial development activities to be conducted by each of us and Sobi, with us bearing all costs incurred in conducting the activities set forth in such initial development plan, as well as certain specified additional costs that are not included in the initial development plan that may be incurred by the parties in developing Licensed Products for PNH in the European Union and the United Kingdom.
 Each party is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the development obligations assigned to it in the development plan. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA for a Licensed Product in each of the Initial Indications, to obtain regulatory approval from the EMA for a Licensed Product in PNH and to assist Sobi to obtain other regulatory and reimbursement approvals for Licensed Products outside of the United States. Sobi is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, Licensed Products for each of the Initial Indications in specified major markets.
 18

We have agreed to supply Sobi with Licensed Products for development and for commercialization outside of the United States in accordance with a supply agreement between the parties. Sobi has the right to perform or have performed drug product manufacturing of Licensed Products for development and for commercialization outside the United States and to manufacture or have manufactured drug substance under certain circumstances.
 Together with Sobi, we have formed several governance committees to oversee the development and manufacture, and to review and discuss the commercialization, of Licensed Products. 
 We have agreed not to, directly or indirectly, alone or with or for any other person or entity, conduct any clinical development or commercialization of APL-9 for any Initial Indication or any other indications subsequently agreed upon by the parties.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Sobi paid an upfront payment of $250.0 million, and agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $915.0 million upon the achievement of specified one-time regulatory and commercial milestone events, including a $50.0 million milestone payment which would be payable upon the first regulatory and reimbursement approval for systemic pegcetacoplan in any major European country. Sobi also agreed to reimburse us for up to $80.0 million in development costs, of which we have received cash payments of $25.0 million to date. We will also be entitled to receive tiered, double-digit royalties (ranging from high teens to high twenties) on sales of Licensed Products outside of the United States, subject to customary deductions and third-party payment obligations, until the latest to occur of: (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of specified licensed patent rights; (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity; and (iii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of the applicable Licensed Product, in each case on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis. Under the agreement, we remain responsible for its license fee obligations (including royalty obligations) to the Penn and for our payment obligations to SFJ.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last Licensed Product outside of the United States. The agreement may be terminated in its entirety by Sobi upon 90 days’ prior written notice at any time after the earlier of (i) October 27, 2022 or (ii) receipt of the first regulatory approval for the first Licensed Product in any of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, or the United Kingdom. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the agreement in its entirety in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, we may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the agreement in any of China, Japan, Brazil, or Canada if Sobi materially breaches its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize a Licensed Product for PNH and ALS in such country. Either party may also terminate the agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party’s insolvency. We may terminate the agreement in the event Sobi or its specified affiliates or sublicensees challenges the validity, scope or enforceability of the licensed patent rights under specified circumstances.
 Research Collaboration with Beam 
 On June 30, 2021, we entered into an exclusive five-year research collaboration with Beam focused on the use of Beam’s proprietary base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement-driven diseases. Under the collaboration agreement, we are collaborating on up to six research programs focused on C3 and other complement targets in the eye, liver and brain.
 Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Beam will apply its base editing technology and conduct preclinical research on up to six base editing programs that target specific genes within the complement system in various organs including the eye, liver and brain. We have exclusive rights to license each of the six programs and will assume responsibility for subsequent development. Beam may elect to enter a 50-50 U.S. co-development and co-commercialization agreement with us with respect to any one program licensed under the collaboration.
 As part of the collaboration, we paid Beam $50.0 million upon signing and are obligated to pay Beam an additional $25.0 million payment on June 30, 2022. After exercise of the opt-in license rights for each of the up to six programs, Beam will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and sales milestones from us, as well as royalty payments on sales. The collaboration has an initial term of five years and may be extended up to two years on a per year and program-by-program basis.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position in a variety of ways, including by pursuing patent protection in certain jurisdictions where it is available. For example, we file U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we own a total of 17 U.S. patents, 26 pending U.S. patent applications, including original filings, continuations, and divisional applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts of many of these patents and patent applications.
 19

Pegcetacoplan and APL-9 are analogs of the cyclic peptide compstatin, based on technologies that we have developed internally or have exclusively licensed from the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, or Penn.
 Our patents and patent applications include families of United States and foreign patent and patent applications relating, for example, to the composition of matter of certain compstatin analogs with a prolonged in vivo half-life, including pegcetacoplan, and/or to methods of treatment and dosing regimens for treating particular complement-dependent diseases. Patents in these families would expire in 2032 or 2033. We have submitted applications for patent term extension for certain of these patents. Our patent applications also include families relating in part to particular doses and dosing regimens for intravitreally or subcutaneously administered pegcetacoplan that are granted or pending in the United States and a number of other jurisdictions. Patents in these families would expire between 2036 and 2038. Four of our U.S. patents are listed for EMPAVELI in the FDA’s Orange Book.  Our filings also include certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to methods of treating eye disorders associated with complement activation, which we acquired in the acquisition of the assets of Potentia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Potentia. These patent rights include issued U.S. patents with claims to methods of treating AMD by administration of compstatin analogs and a granted European patent with claims to a class of compstatin analogs for use in treatment of macular degeneration. These patents have terms that extend into 2026. We also own a patent family relating in part to use of C3 inhibitors, including pegcetacoplan, to facilitate gene therapy with AAV vectors. Patents in this family have terms extending into 2040.  
 In addition to the technology that we developed internally relating to compstatin analogs, we hold exclusive licenses from Penn, including a license agreement with Penn that was assigned to us in connection with our acquisition of the Potentia’s assets in September 2015. The intellectual property in-licensed under our two license agreements with Penn includes four U.S. patents and numerous foreign counterparts, with claims granted in Europe, Japan and elsewhere. These licensed patent rights include issued patents with claims that recite a class of compounds generically covering pegcetacoplan and APL-9, and that specifically recite the active component. These patents have terms that extend to 2026. 
 We also own or have exclusive rights to a number of patent applications relating to additional modalities and molecules for inhibiting complement, including nucleic acid and protein-based approaches.  The filings cover, for example, the composition of matter of our product candidates APL-1030 and APL-2006 and methods of use for treating particular complement-mediated disorders.  Patents issuing based on these applications would have terms extending into 2041 or 2042.
 We have a non-exclusive license to intellectual property covering aspects of base editing technology, including CRISPR proteins and base editors, for use in the context of our collaboration with Beam, and will have an exclusive license to intellectual property specifically covering therapeutic candidates developed under the collaboration.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. 
 Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates, including pegcetacoplan, receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. Expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term adjustment or extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. 
 We granted worldwide rights to use and license the intellectual property that we hold with respect to pegcetacoplan and APL-9 to our wholly owned subsidiaries, APL DEL Holdings, LLC and Apellis Switzerland GmbH. Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries hold rights to use our intellectual property to manage our clinical trials in certain jurisdictions or territories and exclusive rights to distribute our product with respect to specific indications within certain jurisdictions or territories. We granted Sobi an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights), sublicensable license of certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize pegcetacoplan for non-ophthalmological indications in all countries outside of the United States.
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

Patent License Agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (Non-ophthalmic Fields of Use) 
 In March 2008, Apellis AG entered into an agreement with Penn for an exclusive worldwide license, under specified patent rights controlled by Penn, to develop and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights for all fields except the treatment of ophthalmic indications. This license was assigned to us in 2010 in connection with our acquisition of Apellis AG, and we have the right to grant sublicenses under this license. 
 The patent rights licensed to us by Penn include patents with claims that recite a class of compounds generically covering our lead product candidates, pegcetacoplan and APL-9, and specifically recite the active component. Three of these patents are listed for EMPAVELI in the FDA’s Orange Book.
 Under the license agreement, we are obligated to make a $100,000 annual license maintenance payment to Penn until the first commercial sale of a licensed product, some of which may become creditable against milestone payments under specified circumstances. We may also become obligated to make payments to Penn aggregating up to $1,650,000 based on achieving specified development and regulatory approval milestones and up to $2,500,000 based on achieving specified annual sales milestones with respect to each of the first two licensed products, and to pay low single-digit royalties to Penn based on net sales of each licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees and specified minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay Penn a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees. 
 In January 2021 we made payments of $25,050,000 as sublicense fees under this agreement with respect to the Sobi collaboration and certain other strategic collaborations.  
 In August 2021 we made payments of $1,025,000, net of a credit for the annual license maintenance payment, for the achievement of milestones under this agreement. In December 2021, we recorded license costs of $5,000,000 related to the probable achievement of a milestone which we expect to be settled in the first half of 2022.
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed from Penn covering the licensed product in the country or the expiration of a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country. We accrued $0.3 million for royalty obligations to Penn in 2021.
 We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license. 
 We also are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with a development plan, which we will update annually, and a development milestone timetable specified in the agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products. 
 Penn has the right to terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and fail to cure our breach within specified cure periods or in the event of specified bankruptcy, insolvency and liquidation events. We have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience at any time on 60 days’ notice to Penn. 
 Amended and Restated Patent License Agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (Ophthalmic Field of Use) 
 At the same time that it entered into the agreement with Apellis AG, Penn licensed rights to the same portfolio of cases to Potentia, to develop and commercialize products covered by the licensed patent rights for the treatment of ophthalmic indications. In September 2015, Potentia assigned the license agreement between Potentia and Penn to us in connection with our acquisition of the assets of Potentia pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Potentia. 
 Upon Potentia’s assignment of the license to us, we became the licensee and are obligated to make a $100,000 annual license maintenance payment to Penn until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We also became obligated to make payments to Penn aggregating up to $3,200,000 based on achieving specified development and regulatory approval milestones and up to $5,000,000 based on achieving specified annual sales milestones with respect to each licensed product, and to pay low single-digit royalties to Penn based on net sales of each licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees and specified minimum quarterly royalty thresholds. In addition, we are obligated to pay Penn a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensees.
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in a country will extend until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed from Penn covering the licensed product in the country or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license. 
 21

We also are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with a development plan, which we will update annually, and a development milestone timetable specified in the agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products. 
 Penn has the right to terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and fail to cure our breach within specified cure periods or in the event of specified bankruptcy, insolvency and liquidation events. We have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience at any time on 60 days’ notice to Penn. 
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are a number of currently marketed products and product candidates in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat the various diseases that we are targeting. In general, these products and product candidates can be categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates include inflammation suppression by agents such as complement inhibitors and corticosteroids, as well as immune modulators, visual cycle modulators, anti-amyloid agents, antioxidants, neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular and interstitial tissue remodeling agents. 
 Our approved product competes, and if our product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking or planning clinical trials, they will compete, with the products and product candidates discussed below
 GA. There are currently no approved treatments for GA. We are aware that several companies that are actively developing product candidates for the treatment of GA, including the following product candidates that are in clinical development: ANX007, a C1q inhibitor being developed by Annexon Biosciences, Inc. in Phase 2 clinical trials; GT005, a CFI expression subretinal gene therapy being developed by Novartis in Phase 2 clinical trials (Novartis completed its acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics in February 2022 ); IONIS-FB-L(RX), a complement factor B inhibitor being developed by Ionis/Roche in Phase 2 clinical trials; Zimura (avacincaptad pegol), a C5 inhibitor being developed by Iveric Bio (in Phase 2/3 clinical trials; HMR59, an intravitreal gene therapy targeting CD59 being developed by The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (after acquisition from Hemera Biosciences) in Phase 2 clinical trials; NGM621, a C3 inhibitor being developed by NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., in Phase 2 clinical trials; GEM103, a complement factor H targeting therapy being developed by Gemini Therapeutics, in Phase 2 clinical trials; and other product candidates that do not target the complement system that are in Phase 2 clinical trials, including therapies being developed by Alcon, Roche/Genentech, Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Regenerative Patch Technologies, LLC, and Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc. Novartis has announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial of iptacopan, a Factor B inhibitor, in patients with early or intermediate AMD.  AstraZeneca has announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial of orally delivered danicopan (ALXN2040) in GA.
 PNH. The principal competitors for EMPAVELI, and possibly other indications in our hematology and nephrology programs are eculizumab (marketed as Soliris) and ravulizumab (marketed as Ultomiris), which are C5 inhibitors developed and marketed by AstraZeneca. In addition to EMPAVELI, eculizumab and ravulizumab are the only drugs currently approved for the treatment of PNH.  
 We are aware of several other companies that are actively developing product candidates using complement inhibition for the treatment of PNH in late-stage clinical development, including BCX9930, a Factor D inhibitor being developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or BioCryst, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials; crovalimab, an anti-C5 antibody developed by Roche and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., currently in Phase 3 clinical trials; pozelimab, an anti-C5 antibody developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in combination with cemdisiran, an RNAi therapeutic targeting C5 by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., currently in Phase 3 clinical trials; danicopan, a Factor D inhibitor being developed by AstraZeneca as an add-on treatment to eculizumab and ravulizumab, in Phase 3 clinical trials; and iptacopan being developed by Novartis, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as other products in early stages of development. 
 Amgen Inc. is developing ABP959, a biosimilar for eculizumab that is in Phase 3 development, and other non-U.S. entities are developing biosimilars for eculizumab in local markets. The approval of a biosimilar or a generic to one of our products or a product with which we compete could have a material impact on our business because it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products or the other products with which we compete. 
 22

CAD.  Sutimlimab-jome, a C1s inhibitor monoclonal antibody developed by Sanofi was approved by the FDA in February 2022. Treatments in clinical development include iptacopan, an oral Factor B inhibitor, being developed by Novartis; and SAR445088, a C1s inhibitor monoclonal antibody, being developed by Sanofi.
 C3G. There are currently no approved drugs for C3 glomerulopathy, but treatments in clinical development include iptacopan being developed by Novartis, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials; narsoplimab (OMS721), a MASP-2 inhibitor monoclonal antibody being developed by Omeros Corp., in a Phase 2 renal basket trial; avacopan, an oral C5aR-inhibitor developed by ChemoCentryx, Inc., in Phase 2 clinical trials; BCX9930, a Factor D inhibitor being developed by BioCryst, currently in a Phase 2 renal basket trial.
 HSCT-TMA.  Currently there are three treatments in clinical development: Ecluizumab, developed by AstraZeneca, nomacopan being developed by Akari, and narsoplimab, being developed by Omeros.
 ALS.  Currently there are four drug treatments approved by the FDA for treatment of ALS or its symptoms, including edaravone (marketed as Radicava by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America; riluzole, now generic; thickened riluzole, marketed as Tiglutik by ITF Pharma, and dextromethorphan HBr/quinidine sulfate (marketed as Nuedexta by Avanir Pharmaceuticals).   Various companies are conducting clinical trials for symptoms of, or neurological conditions, related to, ALS, with over 50 molecules currently in development that target a broad array of biology, including at least three other anti-complement therapies: Ultomiris by AstraZeneca, in Phase 3 trials, Zilucoplan by UCB/Ra in Phase 2 clinical trials, and ANX005 by Annexon Biosciences. Additionally, Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. recently submitted an NDA and an MAA for AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS.
Sales and Marketing
 We retain U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan and worldwide commercialization rights for intravitreal pegcetacoplan. We are conducting commercialization efforts for EMPAVELI in the United States and plan to conduct commercial development for systemic pegcetacoplan in the United States if it is approved in other indications. We have developed focused capabilities to commercialize development programs for certain indications where we believe that the medical specialists for the indications are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to effectively promote the product with a targeted sales team. In particular, for PNH we have defined our marketing, disease education, patient support and distribution strategies, identified primary and secondary payers representing a significant percentage of patients with PNH, have built our field market access team and our sales team. Sobi is responsible for commercialization of systemic pegcetacoplan outside of the United States.
 For our intravitreal pegcetacoplan program and for programs involving compounds other than pegcetacoplan, we plan to develop our own capabilities to commercialize our products worldwide. We may seek to enter into collaborations that we believe may contribute to our ability to advance development and ultimately commercialize our product candidates. We may also seek to enter into collaborations where we believe that realizing the full commercial value of our development programs will require access to broader geographic markets or the pursuit of broader patient populations or indications. 
 Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. Although we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products, we have recruited personnel with experience to manage the third-party contract manufacturers producing our product candidates and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future. 
 The process for manufacturing our product candidates consists of chemical synthesis, purification using liquid chromatography, and freeze drying into solid form. The drug substance is then dissolved in solution and aliquoted into small vials for individual dosing.  Each of these steps involves a relatively routine chemical engineering process. We expect the costs associated with manufacturing drug product for our product candidates may be comparable to the current manufacturing costs for other similarly sized peptide-based components.
 We have engaged a limited number of third-party manufacturers to provide all of our raw materials, drug substances and finished products for use in clinical trials and commercial sale.  We have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Bachem Americas, Inc., or Bachem, agreeing to purchase a significant portion of our requirements for the pegcetacoplan drug substance over the next five years, and a commercial supply agreement with NOF Corporation, or NOF, to purchase activated polyethylene glycol derivative, or PEG, which is a component of pegcetacoplan. Our raw materials, drug substances and finished products have been produced under master service contracts and specific work orders from these manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume and quality expectations. We choose the third-party manufacturers of the raw materials and drug substances based on the volume required and the regulatory requirements at the relevant stage of development. All lots of drug substances and finished products used in clinical trials and for commercial use are manufactured under current good manufacturing 
 23

practices. Separate third-party manufacturers are for fill and finish services and for labeling and shipment of the final drug products to the clinical trial sites and for commercial use.
 We believe that our manufacturing arrangements are sufficient to supply pegcetacoplan at the scale and with the quality required for our ongoing and planned clinical trials, our commercialization efforts and our collaboration with Sobi. We continuously review our supply chain risk, including with respect to our manufacturing footprint, and update and implement risk mitigation plans.
 Commercial Supply Agreement with Bachem
 On December 30, 2020, we entered into a commercial supply agreement, or the Bachem Agreement, with Bachem to supply the drug substance for the finished dosage form of pegcetacoplan for systemic and intravitreal administration. 
 Under the Bachem Agreement, we agreed to purchase from Bachem a significant portion of our requirements for the drug substance during the term of the agreement, and to purchase all of our requirements for drug substance for commercial sale, subject to certain exceptions, for a period after the effective date of the agreement.
 Unless earlier terminated, the initial term of the Bachem Agreement continues for five years, or the Initial Term. Thereafter, the Bachem Agreement will automatically renew for an additional two-year term. At least 24 months prior to the end of the Initial Term, Bachem will notify us in writing if it is willing to continue to manufacture and supply the drug substance following the end of the Initial Term. For a period of 12 months after receipt of such notice, we have the right to negotiate pricing terms that would apply during the renewal term, which upon agreement will be finalized in an amendment to the Bachem Agreement. We may terminate the Bachem Agreement in the event any required license, permit or certificate of Bachem related to the manufacturing facility or the drug substance is not approved or issued (or is withdrawn) by the relevant governmental authority. Additionally, each party may terminate the Bachem Agreement upon an uncured material breach of the Bachem Agreement by the other party or upon the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy.
 The Bachem Agreement also includes customary provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, quality, storage, handling and transport, intellectual property, confidentiality and indemnification.
 Amended and Restated Commercial Supply Agreement with NOF
 On March 10, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated commercial supply agreement, or the NOF Agreement, with NOF to purchase PEG, which is a component of pegcetacoplan. 
 Under the NOF Agreement, NOF’s affiliate, NOF America Corporation, supplies PEG to us on a non-exclusive basis. NOF agreed to manufacture and deliver PEG to us in accordance with purchase orders issued by the us pursuant to the NOF Agreement. We may purchase PEG or any polyethylene glycol derivative from other third-party suppliers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we agreed to purchase at least a minimum purchase obligation, which will be based on our 24-month rolling forecasts as set forth in the NOF Agreement. In the event we fail to meet the minimum purchase obligation, we will pay NOF the amount equal to a specified percentage of the remaining quantity of the minimum purchase obligation for the relevant time period, in addition to any payments due for all outstanding firm orders. We may eliminate the minimum purchase obligation on or before October 1 of the preceding calendar year by paying a specified percentage of the then-applicable supply price of the remaining minimum purchase obligation for the remainder of the term.
 Unless earlier terminated, the term of the NOF Agreement continues through December 31, 2025. Either party may terminate the NOF Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party, upon the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy or for convenience upon twenty-four (24) months prior written notice. We may terminate the NOF Agreement for safety, efficacy or regulatory issues. If the NOF Agreement is terminated by NOF for convenience or by us for NOF’s breach, we have no minimum purchase obligations and any agreement to buy out such minimum purchase obligations shall be of no force or effect.
 The NOF Agreement also includes customary provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, quality, storage, handling and transport, intellectual property, confidentiality and indemnification.
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, pricing, reimbursement, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 24

The regulatory requirements applicable to drug product development, approval and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities, including state agencies.
 The FDA must approve our product candidates for therapeutic indications before they may be marketed in the United States. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive AEs and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND application as support for an IND or an NDA. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 
Reporting Clinical Trial Results
 Under the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”). In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both the NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.  
 Specifically, the PHSA grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to issue a notice of noncompliance to a responsible party for failure to submit clinical trial information as required. The responsible party, however, is allowed 30 days to 
 26

correct the noncompliance and submit the required information. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is also a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. In addition to civil monetary penalties, violations may also result in other regulatory action, such as injunction and/or criminal prosecution or disqualification from federal grants. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the Department of Health and Human Services’ (the “HHS”) long delay in issuing final implementing regulations, those regulations have now been issued and the FDA did issue its first Notice of Noncompliance to a manufacturer in April 2021.  
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access; however, as required by amendments to the FDCA included in the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests with respect to product candidates in development to treat serious diseases or conditions, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation from the FDA as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 27

 
• | Phase 4: Post-approval studies, which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued guidance on March 18, 2020, and has updated it periodically since that time to address the conduct of clinical trials during the pandemic. The guidance sets out a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical study report (or as a separate document) contingency measures implemented to manage the study, and any disruption of the study as a result of COVID-19; a list of all study participants affected by COVID-19-related study disruptions by a unique subject identifier and by investigational site, and a description of how the individual’s participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the study, among other things.   The FDA has indicated that it will continue to provide any necessary guidance to sponsors, clinical investigators, and research institutions as the public health emergency evolves.
 
Interactions with FDA During the Clinical Development Program
 Following the clearance of an IND and the commencement of clinical trials, the sponsor will continue to have interactions with the FDA. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 In addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program. Specifically, sponsors may meet with the FDA prior to the submission of an IND (Pre-IND meeting), at the end of Phase 2 clinical trial (EOP2 meeting) and before an NDA is submitted (Pre-NDA meeting). Meetings at other times may also be requested. There are four types of meetings that occur between sponsors and the FDA.  Type A meetings are those that are necessary for an otherwise stalled product development program to proceed or to address an important safety issue.  Type B meetings include pre-IND and pre-NDA meetings, as well as end of phase meetings such as EOP2 meetings.  A Type C meeting is any meeting other than a Type A or Type B meeting regarding the development and review of a product, including for example meetings to facilitate early consultations on the use of a biomarker as a new surrogate endpoint that has never been previously used as the primary basis for product approval in the proposed context of use.
These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date with the FDA and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development.  For example, at an EOP2, a sponsor may discuss its Phase 2 clinical results and present its plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that it believes will support the approval of the new product.  Such meetings may be conducted in person, via teleconference/videoconference or written response only with minutes reflecting the questions that the sponsor posed to the FDA and the agency’s responses.  The FDA has indicated that its responses, as conveyed in meeting minutes and advice letters, only constitute mere recommendations and/or advice made to a sponsor and, as such, sponsors are not bound by such recommendations and/or advice. Nonetheless, from a practical perspective, a sponsor’s failure to follow the FDA’s recommendations for design of a clinical program may put the program at significant risk of failure.
 
Manufacturing and Other Regulatory Requirements
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 28

Specifically, the FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.  Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product. 
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”) applications and certain types of supplements to applications must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The sponsor and the FDA must reach agreement on a final plan. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial 
 29

treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 Fourth, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. There is limited experience with accelerated approvals by the FDA based on intermediate clinical endpoints. However, the FDA has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Acceptance and Review of NDAs
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, safety updates, patent information, abuse information and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data 
 30

submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug product. The fee required for the submission and review of an application under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2022 this application fee is approximately $3.1 million), and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $369,000 per eligible prescription product. These fees are typically adjusted annually, and exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.              
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.  In pertinent part, the FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA.  In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File (“RTF”) determination to the applicant.  Typically, an RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information or sections of required information; scientific incompleteness, such as omission of critical data, information or analyses needed to evaluate safety and efficacy or provide adequate directions for use; or inadequate content, presentation, or organization of information such that substantive and meaningful review is precluded.  The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the filing date for an application with “priority review.” The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date. 
 In connection with its review of an application, the FDA will typically submit information requests to the applicant and set deadlines for responses thereto.  The FDA will also conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND and GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant may incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.              
 Additionally, the FDA may refer an application, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.  Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.             
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS. 
 Decisions on NDAs              
 The FDA reviews an applicant to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence.  The term “substantial evidence” is defined under the FDCA as “evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the product involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the product will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.”
 31

The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, the FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. This approach was subsequently endorsed by Congress in 1998 with legislation providing, in pertinent part, that “If [FDA] determines, based on relevant science, that data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, the FDA may consider such data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence.” This modification to the law recognized the potential for the FDA to find that one adequate and well controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence, including supportive data outside of a controlled trial, is sufficient to establish effectiveness.  In December 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance further explaining the studies that are needed to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness. It has not yet finalized that guidance.               
 After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) or an approval letter.  To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product’s safety and efficacy in the NDA. This assessment is also informed by other factors, including: the severity of the underlying condition and how well patients’ medical needs are addressed by currently available therapies; uncertainty about how the premarket clinical trial evidence will extrapolate to real-world use of the product in the post-market setting; and whether risk management tools are necessary to manage specific risks.  In connection with this assessment, the FDA review team will assemble all individual reviews and other documents into an “action package,” which becomes the record for FDA review. The review team then issues a recommendation, and a senior FDA official makes a decision.              
 A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the applicant an additional six-month extension to respond.  
 The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA has taken the position that a CRL is not final agency action making the determination subject to judicial review.              
 An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Under the Ensuring Innovation Act, which was signed into law in April 2021, the FDA must publish action packages summarizing its decisions to approve new drugs within 30 days of approval of such products.  To date, CRLs are not publicly available documents. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the 
 32

sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, the FDA’s regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to a variety of federal and state laws, the most recent of which is still in the process of being phased into the U.S. supply chain and regulatory framework. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the “PDMA”) was the first federal law to set minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states and to regulate the distribution of drug samples. Today, both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Congress more recently enacted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”), which made significant amendments to the FDCA, including by replacing certain provisions from the PDMA pertaining to wholesale distribution of prescription drugs with a more comprehensive statutory scheme. The DSCSA now requires uniform national standards for wholesale distribution and, for the first time, for third-party logistics providers; it also provides for preemption of certain state laws in the areas of licensure and prescription drug traceability. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval 
 33

for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Generic Drugs and Regulatory Exclusivity
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...” 
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, a generic or follow-on drug application may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes the FDA to expedite review of competitor generic therapies or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 As part of the submission of an NDA or certain supplemental applications, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of a new drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book.  The FDA’s regulations governing patent listings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021.When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the 
 34

applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Those circumstances include instances in which another sponsor’s application for the same drug product and indication is shown to be “clinically superior” to the previously approved drug. In this context, clinically superior means that the drug provides a significant therapeutic advantage over and above the already approved drug in terms of greater efficacy, greater safety or by providing a major contribution to patient care. Competitors 
 35

may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Under FDARA, orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another orphan drug under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 Review and Clearance or Approval of Medical Devices in the United States 
 Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA. Under the FDCA, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. This definition provides a clear distinction between a medical device and other FDA regulated products such as drugs. If the primary intended use of the product is achieved through chemical action or by being metabolized by the body, the product is usually a drug. If not, it is generally a medical device. 
 Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States until it has been cleared through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. 
 A 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (i) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (ii) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414.
 Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared medical device may require the submission of another 510(k) or a PMA if the changes could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device. Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device frequently require the submission of a traditional 510(k), but modifications meeting certain conditions may be candidates for FDA review under a Special 510(k). If a device modification requires the submission of a 510(k), but the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental technology of the device, then summary information that results from the design control process associated with the cleared device can serve as the basis for clearing the application. A Special 510(k) 
 36

allows a manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing new data. When the modification involves a change in material, the nature of the “new” material will determine whether a traditional or Special 510(k) is necessary. 
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
 Review and Approval of Combination Products in the United States 
 Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different Centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 
  
• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a drug or device packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug or device where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any investigational drug or device packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-drug combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA Center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
  Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 27-member EU, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas.  In the EU, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.   
 With the exception of the EU/European Economic Area (“EEA”) applying the harmonized regulatory rules for medicinal products, the approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 
Clinical Trial Approval
 
37


The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, and where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigational drug product that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (“Clinical Trials Regulation”) was adopted.  The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The new Regulation is scheduled to come into application on January 31, 2022, following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System through an independent audit by the European Commission in mid-2020. The Clinical Trials Regulation will come into application in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC.  The conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable at the end of January 2022. According to the transitional provisions, if a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable, the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an E.U. member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all E.U. member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various E.U. member states where such product has not previously received marketing approval in any E.U. member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and 
 38

related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 Within this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate preclinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a generic medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the reference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC. 
 Hybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was authorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid application may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at the community level. 
 Pediatric Studies in the EU
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Paediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate because (a) the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in part or all of the pediatric population; (b) the disease or condition occurs only in adult population; or (c) the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. 
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file with respect to quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the EC or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of 
 39

centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 
 As in the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, including compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
 
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the EU. 
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States.  Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life- threatening or chronically debilitating condition, (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.  The term ‘significant benefit’ is defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000 to mean a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care.
 Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year market exclusivity period, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA, cannot accept an application for a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: (1) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 40

Pediatric Exclusivity in the EU
 If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, or alternatively a one year extension of the regulatory market exclusivity from ten to eleven years, as selected by the marketing authorization holder.
 
Patent Term Extensions
 
The EU also provides for patent term extension through SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained. Although SPCs are available throughout the EU, sponsors must apply on a country‑by‑country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the EU.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom (U.K.) voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Following protracted negotiations, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable up to two years). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime that applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom, as the United Kingdom legislation now has the potential to diverge from European Union legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an European Union member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021.  This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. 
 General Data Protection Regulation
 Many countries outside of the United States maintain rigorous laws governing the privacy and security of personal information. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data regarding individuals who are located in the EEA, and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive personal data relates before processing such data. Examples of obligations imposed by the GDPR on companies processing personal data that falls within the scope of the GDPR include, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.  In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States.  Following the withdrawal of the 
 41

U.K. from the EU, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the U.K. and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic, health outcome studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity, quality of life benefits, and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective in light of cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct studies that compare the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such studies could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
 Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits and issue guidance to prescribers. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, reference pricing and cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.  
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order of, any good or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 42

 
service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and their business associates that associates that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. This legislation resulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2031. However, pursuant to the CARES Act and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions are suspended through the end of March 2022 and from April 2022 through June 2022, a 1% cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden 
 43

rescinded those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access.  This Executive Order also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to create a special enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict how federal agencies will respond to such Executive Orders.
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  To those ends, the Trump Administration issued five executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription drug products but it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these orders will remain in force under the Biden Administration.  Further, on September 24, 2020, the Trump Administration finalized a rulemaking allowing states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Applicants are required to demonstrate that their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  The FDA has issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).  
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Employees and Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 476 full-time employees. Of these employees, 448 were based in the United States and 28 were based in international locations and 42 held Ph.D., Pharm.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We also retain independent contractors to support the goals of our organization. We are committed to providing a positive employee experience and a culture that embodies our values.
 Fostering a diverse and inclusive culture which invests in attracting, retaining, engaging and developing our people is critical to achieving our business objectives and bringing value to patients, shareholders and all stakeholders.  We are a majority female organization, and we maintain significant female representation at all levels. As of December 31, 2021, 57% of our workforce were women and 34% represented in senior leadership roles. Racial and ethnic diversity in the aggregate has improved at our company over the last few years. As of December 31, 2021, 25% of our workforce were ethnically diverse and 6.8% represented in senior leadership roles. However, we recognize that there is still important progress to be made, particularly as relates to Black and Latino representation at our company, and this remains an area of continued emphasis for us.
 To incentivize and reward strong performance, we have a competitive compensation and benefits programs, including short-term and long-term incentives, exceptional health and wellness benefits along with generous vacation and leave programs.
 We regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our talent management practices through employee surveys and fostering a culture of ongoing feedback. In addition, we track important talent metrics such as turnover rate and employee engagement. Voluntary and involuntary turnover rates across all levels (executives/ senior managers, mid-level managers and professionals) are in alignment with, or lower than, the industry average.
 Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated our commitment to the health and wellbeing of our employees, our patients and our community upholding local and federal public health guidelines. With input from our employees, we developed a new working model. This new model includes:  
  
• | Standard operating procedures designed to protect the health and well-being of our team and communities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexibility for employees to balance their preferred work arrangements (on-site, partially on-site, or fully remote) with business needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adapted office settings to enable difference work experiences ensuring safe space for collaboration, social and communal engagement, and appropriate space for larger group meetings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 44

 
• | Adopted technology and operating practices to support communicating and collaborating as a hybrid workforce reinforcing our values.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invested in wellness programs and resources to help employees balance work-life throughout the pandemic and beyond.
