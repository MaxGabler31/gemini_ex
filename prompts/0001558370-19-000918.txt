 Item 1. Business
 Overview
     Mobile and cloud computing are the catalysts for modern work. Mobile lets employees make better decisions and take faster actions because the information and tools they need to do their jobs are always available. Cloud lets developers build innovative services quickly and lets employees start using them easily.
     However, this comes with new risks. The traditional, locked-down, perimeter-based approach to security no longer applies to mobile endpoints and cloud services that operate outside the network. Data no longer resides behind the firewall on locked-down PCs and servers, and so it cannot be secured by firewall-based solutions. Instead, data is spread across an information fabric that spans a wide variety of modern endpoints including Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows 10, as well as cloud services such as Box, Concur, Microsoft Office 365, Netsuite, Salesforce, Workday and custom cloud applications. 
     This shift to mobile and cloud technologies introduces three main challenges that CIOs and CISOs need to address: 
    
1. | Drive business innovation by allowing employees to securely use mobile, cloud, and other endpoints for work.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Enforce corporate security without impacting the user experience.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Redefine enterprise security strategies to address a perimeter-less environment.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      To solve these challenges, many organizations are in the early stages of investigating a zero trust enterprise security framework. Zero trust assumes that bad actors are already in the network and secure access is determined by an “always verify, never trust” approach.
     We are a leader in defining a zero trust, mobile-centric framework, one that goes beyond traditional approaches to security by utilizing a more comprehensive set of attributes to grant secure access. At MobileIron, we validate the device, establish user context, check app authorization, verify the network, and detect and mitigate threats before granting secure access to a device or user. We believe traditional identity-based and gateway approaches to zero trust fall short because they provide only limited visibility into devices, apps, and threats.
     We are redefining how customers build a secure foundation in a perimeter-less world. Our security platform is built on the foundation of unified endpoint management (UEM) with additional zero trust capabilities including single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and mobile threat defense (MTD). Together they create a more seamless mobile experience by automating access control decisions across users, endpoints, operating systems, clouds, networks, threats, and vulnerabilities so that only trusted resources can access corporate data.
     Our Business Model 
     Our customers can deploy MobileIron as either a cloud service or on-premises software. They can choose subscription-based or perpetual licensing. We primarily target midsize and large enterprises around the world across a broad range of industries including financial services, government, healthcare, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, technology, and telecommunications. 
     Our business model is based on winning new customers, growing existing customers through seat expansion and product upsell, and renewing subscriptions and software support agreements. Our channel partners include distributors, resellers, service providers, and system integrators. Our revenue grew to $193.2 million in 2018 and we have experienced rapid growth in our customer base, having sold our platform to over 18,000 cumulative customers since 2009. In 2018, we generated over three-fourths of our gross billings from recurring sources (subscriptions and software support agreements).

· | MobileIron Access blocks untrusted devices and apps from accessing cloud services based on security posture and compliance. Access also provides single sign-on (SSO) and multifactor authentication (MFA) across applications on the device so that users do not have to repeatedly enter their passwords. In addition, MobileIron Tunnel provides secure connectivity through a per-app VPN to connect applications to back-end services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | MobileIron Threat Defense uses machine learning-based analytics to identify zero-day threats on the device, across networks, and within client apps, and then initiates a security response, from notification to remediation of the threat.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | MobileIron Secure Applications for End-user Productivity include Apps@Work (enterprise app store), Docs@Work (secure content), Email+ (secure email and PIM), Help@Work (remote troubleshooting), and Web@Work (secure browsing). In addition, MobileIron AppConnect is an SDK and wrapper that third-party developers can integrate into their applications to provide a higher level of security through additional encryption and advanced security controls.

         Customers
 Our customers include leading enterprises in a broad range of industries, including financial services, government, healthcare, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, technology and telecommunications. No single industry verticals accounted for more than 20% of our gross billings in the three year period ended 2018. Medium to large enterprises accounted for a majority of our billings. We have sold our products to over 18,000 customers globally, including more than 500 companies on the Forbes Global 2000 Leading Companies list, as of December 31, 2018. Our channel partners include resellers, service providers and system integrators. We recognized 42%, 47% and 46% of total revenue from customers with a billing address in the United States in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recognized 16%, 13% and 13% of total revenue from customers with a billing address in Germany in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other country exceeded 10% of the total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016. AT&T, Inc., as a reseller, accounted for approximately 10%, 13% and 15% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No end user of our products accounted for more than 5% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Backlog
 As is typical in the software industry, we expect a significant portion of our software license orders to be received in the last month of each quarter. We do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it has historically been immaterial relative to our total revenue and is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period.  Sales and Marketing
 We sell the substantial majority of our products through indirect sales channels and, as a result, maintain a sales force that works closely with our channel partners to develop sales opportunities. We have an outside salesforce focused on large organizations and an inside salesforce focused on mid-sized organizations. Our channel team works with our service providers to address small to mid-sized organizations. Our marketing team focuses on driving customer demand, building brand reputation, expanding market awareness, and enabling our internal and extended (channel) sales teams. 
 Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical support and the technical training of our channel partners. Our sales organization has strong alignment with our customer success organization. Our sales cycle ranges from a few weeks for small businesses to many months for large enterprises.
 We work with mobile and security focused channel partners to sell our platform to customers. We focus on building in-depth relationships with a number of solutions-oriented partners that have strong industry expertise. These channel partners include both traditional IT resellers as well as service providers. We operate a formal accreditation program for the sales and technical professionals of our channel partners. 
 Research and Development
 We have invested significant time and financial resources in the development of our platform and believe that continued research and development is critical to our ongoing success. Research and development investments drive innovation and keep pace with the rapidly evolving mobile and cloud ecosystem. We believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our customers and channel partners and improving our competitive position.

 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the devices, operating systems, applications and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements.
 Our competitors fall into three primary categories: 

· | diversified technology companies such as Microsoft, VMware, and IBM;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | mobile specialists such as BlackBerry; and
--+-------------------------------------------


· | mobile security vendors such as Lookout and Symantec.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  The principal competitive factors in our market include: 

· | product features, reliability, performance and effectiveness;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | price and total cost of ownership;
--+-----------------------------------


· | depth of customer relationships;
--+---------------------------------


· | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | flexibility between cloud and on-premise deployment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | mobile IT expertise and focus;
--+-------------------------------


· | channel depth and breadth;
--+---------------------------


· | strength of sales and marketing efforts;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | brand awareness and reputation; and
--+------------------------------------


· | focus on customer service and success.
--+---------------------------------------

  We believe we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources, stronger name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution and more entrenched relationships. Some of them embed their competitive solutions into broader software and services bundles. For more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     Intellectual Property 
 We protect our core technology and intellectual property by relying on federal, state, common law and international intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks. We also rely on confidentiality and contractual restrictions, including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
 We pursue registration of our patents, trademarks and domain names in the United States and certain locations outside the United States. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from the Company and acquire patents we believe may be useful or relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 81 patents worldwide covering various innovations of our modern unified endpoint management (UEM) technology. The U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from July 28, 2028 to May 24, 2037.

 Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available outside the United States. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.
 Companies in the mobile and other technology industries or non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have faced, and expect to face in the future, suits or allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including those of our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 889 full-time employees, 349 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development, 276 of whom were primarily engaged in sales and marketing, 156 of whom were primarily engaged in customer success and 108 of whom were primarily engaged in administration and finance. 399 of those employees were located outside of the United States. None of our United States employees are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. Employees in certain European countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We have never had a work stoppage, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.  Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices are located in Mountain View, California and include two buildings totaling approximately 78,000 square feet under leases expiring from June 2020 to May 2023. We have additional office locations in the United States and in various international locations, including offices in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Singapore and India. 
 We may add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add employees, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet our future needs. 
 Legal Proceedings
 We continually evaluate uncertainties associated with litigation and record an accrual equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, if any, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss, and such amounts could be material. We record litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable. For legal proceedings for which there is a reasonable possibility of loss (meaning those losses for which the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable), we have determined we do not have material exposure on an aggregate basis.     Indemnification
 Under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales related contracts, we agree to defend and/or settle claims brought by third parties against our customers and channel partners alleging that our software or the customer’s use thereof infringes the third party’s intellectual property right, such as a patent right. These indemnification obligations are typically not subject to limitation; however if we believe such a claim is reasonably likely to occur and if it is commercially impractical for us to either procure the right for the customer to continue to use our software or modify our software so that it’s not infringing, we can terminate the customer agreement and refund the customer a portion of the

license fees paid (prorated over the three year period from initial delivery for software licensed on a perpetual basis). We also on occasion indemnify our customers for other types of third party claims. In addition, we indemnify our officers, directors, and certain key employees while they are serving in such capacities in good faith. Through December 31, 2018, we have not received any material written claim for indemnification.
