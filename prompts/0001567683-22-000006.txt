Item 1 — Business
General
Clearway Energy, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a publicly-traded energy infrastructure investor in and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. The Company is indirectly owned by Global Infrastructure Partners, or GIP. GIP is an independent infrastructure fund manager that makes equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets and businesses. The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, Clearway Energy Group LLC, or CEG.
The Company is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S. with over 5,000 net MW of installed wind and solar generation projects. The Company's over 9,000 net MW of assets also includes approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities as well as the Thermal Business. Through this environmentally-sound, diversified and primarily contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. Substantially all of the Company's generation assets are under long-term contractual arrangements for the output or capacity from these assets. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 12 years as of December 31, 2021 based on CAFD.
The Company consolidates the results of Clearway Energy LLC through its controlling interest, with CEG's interest shown as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. The holders of the Company's outstanding shares of Class A and Class C common stock are entitled to dividends as declared. CEG receives its distributions from Clearway Energy LLC through its ownership of Clearway Energy LLC Class B and Class D units. From time to time, CEG may also hold shares of the Company's Class A and/or Class C common stock.
On October 22, 2021, Clearway Energy Operating LLC entered into a binding agreement to sell the Thermal Business to KKR Thor Bidco, LLC, an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR, for total consideration of $1.9 billion, subject to customary closing adjustments, which is referred to herein as the Thermal Disposition. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022. The Company's Thermal segment is comprised solely of the Thermal Business's results of operations. For further discussion of the Thermal Disposition, refer to Item 15 — Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.

    The diagram below depicts the Company’s organizational structure as of December 31, 2021:
Business Strategy
The Company's primary business strategy is to focus on the acquisition and ownership of assets with predictable, long-term cash flows in order that it may be able to increase the cash dividends paid to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock over time without compromising the ongoing stability of the business.
The Company's plan for executing its business strategy includes the following key components:
Focus on contracted renewable energy and conventional generation. The Company owns and operates utility scale and distributed renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation assets with proven technologies, low operating risks and stable cash flows. The Company believes by focusing on this core asset class and leveraging its industry knowledge, it will maximize its strategic opportunities, be a leader in operational efficiency and maximize its overall financial performance. The Company also owns the Thermal Business that Clearway Energy Operating LLC has entered into a binding agreement to sell to KKR. For further discussion of the Thermal Disposition, refer to Item 15 — Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.

Growing the business through acquisitions of contracted operating assets. The Company believes that its base of operations provides a platform for strategic growth through cash accretive and tax advantaged acquisitions complementary to its existing portfolio. In addition to acquiring generation facilities from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides it with a competitive advantage, the Company may consummate future acquisitions from CEG. The Company believes that CEG's project development expertise provides the Company access to a development platform with an extensive pipeline of potential renewable energy and storage projects that are aligned to support the Company's growth. Furthermore, the Company has entered into the CEG ROFO Agreement, whereby CEG has granted the Company and its affiliates a right of first offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of certain assets of CEG, or the CEG ROFO Assets, until August 31, 2023. CEG is not obligated to sell the remaining CEG ROFO Assets to the Company and, if offered by CEG, the Company cannot be sure whether these assets will be offered on acceptable terms, or that the Company will choose to consummate such acquisitions. The Company and CEG work collaboratively in considering new assets to be added under the CEG ROFO Agreement or to be acquired by the Company outside of the CEG ROFO Agreement. The assets listed below, all of which are included in a co-investment partnership with Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc., represent the Company's currently committed investments in projects with CEG and the CEG ROFO Assets:

Asset | Technology | Gross Capacity (MW) | State | COD | Status 
Mililani I | Solar | 39 | HI | 2H22 | Committed
Waiawa | Solar | 36 | HI | 2H22 | Committed
Daggett Solar 2 and 3 | Solar | 482 | CA | 2H22/1H23 | Committed

Primary focus on North America. The Company intends to primarily focus its investments in North America (including the unincorporated territories of the U.S.). The Company believes that industry fundamentals in North America present it with significant opportunity to grow its portfolio without creating significant exposure to currency and sovereign risk. By primarily focusing its efforts on North America, the Company believes it will best leverage its regional knowledge of power markets, industry relationships and skill sets to maximize the performance of the Company.
Maintain sound financial practices to grow the dividend. The Company intends to maintain a commitment to disciplined financial analysis and a balanced capital structure to enable it to increase its quarterly dividend over time and serve the long-term interests of its stockholders. The Company's financial practices include a risk and credit policy focused on transacting with creditworthy counterparties; a financing policy, which focuses on seeking an optimal capital structure through various capital formation alternatives to minimize interest rate and refinancing risks, ensure stable long-term dividends and maximize value; and a dividend policy that is based on distributing a significant portion of CAFD each quarter that the Company receives from Clearway Energy LLC, subject to available capital, market conditions and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company intends to evaluate various alternatives for financing future acquisitions and refinancing of existing project-level debt, in each case, to reduce the cost of debt, extend maturities and maximize CAFD.
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous and diverse industry participants. The Company competes on the basis of the location of its plants and on the basis of contract price and terms of individual projects. Within the power industry, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies with whom the Company competes depending on the market. Competitors for energy supply are utilities, independent power producers and other providers of distributed generation. The Company also competes to acquire new projects with renewable developers who retain renewable power plant ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and other dividend, growth-oriented companies. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by capital market conditions and by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies, including tax policy. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating projects, and it could be difficult for the Company to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations.
The Company's Thermal Business has certain cost efficiencies that may form barriers to entry. Generally, there is only one district energy system in a given territory, for which the only competition comes from on-site systems. While the district energy system can usually make an effective case for the efficiency of its services, some building owners nonetheless may opt for on-site systems, either due to corporate policies regarding allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient or because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site. Growth in existing district energy systems generally comes from new building construction or existing building conversions within the service territory of the district energy provider. On October 22, 2021, Clearway Energy Operating LLC entered into a binding agreement to sell the Thermal Business to KKR. For further discussion of the Thermal Disposition, refer to Item 15 — Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.

Competitive Strengths
Stable, high quality cash flows. The Company's facilities have a stable, predictable cash flow profile consisting of predominantly long-life electric generation assets that sell electricity under long-term fixed priced contracts or pursuant to regulated rates with investment-grade and certain other creditworthy counterparties. The Company's facilities have minimal fuel risk. For the Company's contracted conventional assets, fuel is provided by the toll counterparty or the cost thereof is a pass-through cost under the Contract for Differences. Renewable facilities have no fuel costs, and most of the Company's thermal infrastructure assets have contractual or regulatory tariff mechanisms for fuel cost recovery. The offtake agreements for the Company's conventional and renewable generation facilities have a weighted-average remaining duration, based on CAFD, of approximately 12 years as of December 31, 2021, providing long-term cash flow stability. The Company's generation offtake agreements with counterparties for whom credit ratings are available have a weighted-average Moody’s rating of Ba1 based on rated capacity under contract and continues to be influenced by the PG&E Bankruptcy. All of the Company's assets are in the U.S. and accordingly have no currency or repatriation risks.
Environmentally well-positioned portfolio of assets. The Company's portfolio of electric generation assets consists of over 5,000 net MW of renewable generation capacity that are non-emitting sources of power generation. Additionally, the Company's California conventional assets consist of efficient gas generation facilities that support electric system reliability. The Company does not anticipate having to expend any significant capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with current environmental regulations applicable to its generation assets. Taken as a whole, the Company believes its strategy will be a net beneficiary of current and potential environmental legislation and regulatory requirements that may serve as a catalyst for capacity retirements and improve market opportunities for environmentally well-positioned assets like the Company's assets once its current offtake agreements expire.
High quality, long-lived assets with low operating and capital requirements.  The Company benefits from a portfolio of relatively younger assets, other than thermal infrastructure assets. The Company's assets are comprised of proven and reliable technologies, provided by leading original solar and wind equipment manufacturers such as General Electric, Siemens AG, SunPower Corporation, or SunPower, First Solar Inc., or First Solar, Vestas, Mitsubishi, Trina Solar, JA Solar and Siemens Gamesa. Given the modern nature of the portfolio, which includes a substantial number of relatively low operating and maintenance cost solar and wind generation assets, the Company expects to achieve high fleet availability and expend modest maintenance-related capital expenditures.
Significant scale and diversity. The Company is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S. with over 5,000 net MW of installed wind and solar generation projects. The Company's over 9,000 net MW of assets also includes approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities as well as the Thermal Business. The Company's contracted renewable and conventional generation assets benefit from significant diversification in terms of technology, fuel type, counterparty and geography. The Company's Thermal Business consists of fifteen operations, seven of which are district energy centers that provide steam and chilled water to approximately 685 customers, and eight of which provide generation. The Company believes its scale and access to best practices across the fleet improves its business development opportunities through enhanced industry relationships, reputation and understanding of regional power market dynamics. Furthermore, the Company's diversification reduces its operating risk profile and reliance on any single market.
Relationship with GIP and CEG. The Company believes that its relationship with GIP and CEG provides significant benefits. Global Infrastructure Management, LLC, or GIM, the manager of GIP, is an independent infrastructure fund manager that makes equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets and businesses in both the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and select emerging market countries. GIM has a strong track record of investment and value creation in the renewable energy sector. GIM also has extensive experience with publicly traded yield vehicles and development platforms, ranging from Europe's first application of a yield company/development company model to the largest renewable platform in Asia-Pacific. Additionally, the Company believes that CEG provides the Company access to a highly capable renewable development and operations platform that is aligned to support the Company's growth.

Thermal infrastructure business has high entry costs. Significant capital has been invested to construct the Company's thermal infrastructure assets, serving as a barrier to entry in the markets in which such assets operate. The Company's thermal district energy centers are located in urban city areas, with the chilled water and steam delivery systems located underground. Constructing underground delivery systems in urban areas requires long lead times for permitting, rights of way and inspections and is costly. By contrast, the incremental cost to add new customers in existing markets is relatively low. Once thermal infrastructure is established, the Company believes it has the ability to retain customers over long periods of time and to compete effectively for additional business against stand-alone on-site heating and cooling generation facilities. Installation of stand-alone equipment can require significant modification to a building as well as significant space for equipment and funding for capital expenditures. The Company's system technologies often provide economies of scale in terms of fuel procurement, ability to switch between multiple types of fuel to generate thermal energy, and fuel conversion efficiency. On October 22, 2021, Clearway Energy Operating LLC entered into a binding agreement to sell the Thermal Business to KKR. For further discussion of the Thermal Disposition, refer to Item 15 — Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.

Policy Incentives
Policy incentives in the U.S. have the effect of making the development of renewable energy projects more competitive by providing tax credits or grants and accelerated depreciation for a portion of the development costs, decreasing the costs and risks associated with developing such projects or creating demand for renewable energy assets through RPS programs. The elimination of, loss of or reduction in such incentives could decrease the attractiveness of renewable generation projects to developers, including, but not limited to, CEG, which could reduce the Company's acquisition opportunities. Such an elimination, loss or reduction could also reduce the Company's willingness to pursue or develop certain renewable energy projects due to higher operating costs or decreased revenues under its PPAs. 
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS, wind and solar projects are generally fully depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period (before taking into account certain conventions) even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, also provides the ability for wind and solar projects to claim immediate expensing for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.

Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to a percentage of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. In order to qualify for the PTC (or ITC in lieu of the PTC), construction of a wind facility must begin before a specified date and the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, issued guidance stating that the safe harbor for continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four years after the year in which construction of the facility began. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRS extended this safe harbor by one year for facilities that began construction in 2016 or 2017. In 2021, the IRS further extended the continuity safe harbor period to six years for facilities that began construction in 2016 through 2019. For facilities that began construction in 2020, the continuity safe harbor was extended to five years.
Owners of solar projects are eligible to claim an ITC for new solar projects. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and has also been extended several times, including most recently by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020.
 Tax credits for qualifying wind and solar projects are subject to the following phase-down schedule:

 | Year construction of project begins
 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | | 2022 | | 2023 | 2024
PTC (a) | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 80 | % | | 60 | % | 40 | % | | 60 | % | 60 | % | — | % | — | % | — | %
On Shore Wind ITC (b) | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 24 | % | | 18 | % | 12 | % | | 18 | % | 18 | % | — | % | — | % | — | %
Solar ITC (c) | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 26 | % | 26 | % | 26 | % | 22 | % | 10 | %

(a) Percentage of the full PTC available for wind projects that begin construction during the applicable year.
(b) The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 provides for a new 30% ITC for offshore wind projects that begin construction before January 1, 2026.
(c) ITC is limited to 10% for projects not placed in service before January 1, 2026.
RPS, currently in place in certain states and territories, require electricity providers in the state or territory to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have set renewable energy goals to reduce GHG emissions from historic levels. The Company believes that these standards and goals will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future.
Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and thermal energy markets, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These agencies include FERC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Company's assets are located. Each of the Company's U.S. generating facilities qualifies as an EWG or QF. In addition, the Company is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain of the Company's subsidiaries must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company has generating facilities subject to NERC's reliability authority. The Company's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by PUCT.
FERC
FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. The transmission and sale of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. Under existing regulations, FERC has the authority to determine whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG, as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also has the authority to determine whether a generation facility meets the applicable criteria of a QF under the PURPA. Each of the Company’s U.S. generating facilities qualifies as either an EWG or QF.
The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce of public utilities (as defined by the FPA). Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates owners and operators of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public utilities, and is charged with ensuring that market rules that are just and reasonable.
11 



Public utilities are required to obtain FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Several of the Company's QF generating facilities and all of the Company’s non-QF generating facilities located in the U.S. outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates. FERC conducts a review of the market-based rates of Company public utilities and potential market power every three years according to a regional schedule established by FERC.
In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has approved the NERC as the national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system, with such authority delegated in part to regional reliability entities charged with enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the region which they are responsible for overseeing.
The PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. The PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering the PURPA as it applies to QFs. QFs are exempt from certain regulations under the FPA.
The PUHCA provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies. The Company is exempt from many of the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA.
Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to a wide range of environmental laws during the development, construction, ownership and operation of facilities. These existing and future laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of facilities. The Company is obligated to comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and required to implement environmental programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted energy assets. Federal and state environmental laws have historically become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the future.
A number of regulations that may affect the Company are under review for potential revision or rescission in 2022, including the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) incidental take permit regulations and federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act incidental take permit regulations. Government leaders have also considered proposed MBTA legislation (Lowenthal Bill). The Company will evaluate the impact of the legislation and regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions and legal challenges are resolved. To the extent that proposed legislation and new or revised regulations restrict or otherwise impact the Company's operations, the proposed legislation and regulations could have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance.
Proposed Federal MBTA Incidental Take Legislation and Regulations — On October 4, 2021, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issued the final MBTA rule, effective December 3, 2021, restoring the MBTA to prohibit the incidental take of migratory birds. FWS also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) advising that it intends to gather information necessary to develop proposed regulations to authorize the incidental take of migratory birds under prescribed conditions and prepare a draft environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. In the ANPR, FWS is considering authorizing incidental take using three primary mechanisms: exceptions to the MBTA’s prohibition on incidental take, general permits for certain activity types and specific or individual permits. FWS is seeking comments on when and how it should apply these three mechanisms to different types of activities. The Company is working with renewable industry groups to provide comments on the proposed rule. Scoping comments on the ANPR were due to FWS by December 3, 2021 and the company participated in this process through the industry groups. FWS is expecting to have the Draft Environmental Impact Statement out for public review during the summer 2022 and the Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision are anticipated for the following summer 2023.
Changes to the National Environmental Policy Act — On October 7, 2021, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) published notice of proposed rulemaking that would alter regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in order "to generally restore regulatory provisions that were in effect for decades before being modified in 2020." Specifically, the proposed rule would (1) grant federal agencies greater discretion in developing project alternatives; (2) allow federal agencies to adopt NEPA regulations more stringent than CEQ’s regulations; and (3) require agencies to consider direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of major federal actions. The Notice represents "Phase 1" of the Biden Administration’s plans to revise NEPA regulations, which focuses on provisions that pose significant near-term interpretation or implementation challenges and that "make sense to revert to the 1978 regulatory approach." A "Phase 2" proposal that will "more broadly revisit the 2020 NEPA Regulations" is expected to be released in 2022.
12 



Proposed Federal Eagle Incidental Take Permit Proposed Rule — On September 14, 2021, the FWS published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) seeking public and regulated-community input on potential approaches for further expediting and simplifying the permit process authorizing incidental take of eagles. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeks comment on several approaches that could potentially underpin a more streamlined eagle incidental-take-permitting framework that was first established in 2009. Specifically, FWS is interested in comments clarifying specific aspects of the current permitting process that hinder permit application, processing, or implementation. FWS is also seeking recommendations for additional guidance that would reduce the time and/or cost associated with applying for and implementing long-term, eagle incidental take permits under existing regulations. FWS is looking for recommendations for targeted revisions that could be made to existing regulations consistent with the overall permitting framework that would reduce the time and/or cost associated with applying for and processing long-term permits for incidental take of eagles. Finally, FWS is interested in comments regarding potential new regulatory approaches to authorizing incidental take under the Eagle Act, particularly for projects that can be shown in advance to have minimal impacts on eagles, that would reduce the time and/or cost associated with applying for and operating under long-term permits for the incidental take of eagles. The Company is working with renewable industry groups to provide comments on the proposed rule. Comments on the ANPR were due to FWS by October 29, 2021 and the company participated in this process through the industry groups.
Local California Air District Rules — Air districts have proposed updates to its respective rules to amend, as applicable, Best Available Control Technology criteria for stationary emissions sources including gas turbines, Toxic Air Contaminant Health Risk reporting and general reporting requirements. Rulemaking in the Los Angeles Air Basin, as regulated by South Coast Air Quality Management District, or SCAQMD, continues to update command-and-control regulations that limit NOx  emissions for stationary sources in preparation for sunsetting SCAQMD’s Regional Clean Air Market, or RECLAIM, NOx cap and trade program in the next few years. The Company’s conventional generation plants meet the district’s existing and proposed amendments to command-and-control regulations. Proposed updates to local California Air District Rules are not expected to affect the operations nor compliance of the Company’s conventional generation plants.

Our Product & Customers focuses on pursuing opportunities that provide more equitable access to renewable energy for low-to-moderate income customers; supporting the diversity, equity and inclusion goals of the Company's offtakers; and meaningfully representing that work in the external market. 
Our Purchasing focuses on establishing a non-discriminatory practices standard for the Company’s suppliers, diverse vendor sourcing and benchmarking. 
In addition to the personnel of CEG, the Company relies on other third-party service providers in the daily operations of its conventional facilities and certain renewable facilities.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
The Company is committed to engaging with its stakeholders on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, matters in a proactive, holistic and integrated manner. The Company strives to provide recent, credible and comparable data to ESG agencies while engaging institutional investors and investor advocacy organizations around ESG issues. The Company's Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee reviews developing trends and emerging ESG matters as well as the Company’s strategies, activities policies and communications regarding ESG matters, and makes recommendations to the Company's Board of Directors regarding potential actions by the Company.
Since December 2019, the Company has issued $2.1 billion of corporate green bonds under a green bond framework that applies the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and assets meeting certain criteria focused on the supply of energy from renewable resources, including solar energy and wind energy. The Company's projects and alignment of its Green Bond Principles (2018) are reviewed by Sustainalytics, an outside consultant with recognized expertise in ESG research and analysis.
The Company includes safety performance goals in the annual incentive plan for its management and the Company had zero fatalities in 2021. In response to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Company has implemented preventative measures and developed corporate and regional response plans to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers and other business counterparties, while supporting the Company’s suppliers and customers’ operations to the best of its ability in the circumstances. The Company also has modified certain business practices (including limiting non-essential business travel, implementing a temporary work-from-home policy for employees who can execute their work remotely and encouraging employees to adhere to local and regional social distancing, more stringent hygiene and cleaning protocols across the Company’s facilities and operations and self-quarantining recommendations) to support efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and its variants and to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. The Company continues to evaluate these measures, response plans and business practices in light of the evolving effects of COVID-19 and its variants.
As discussed in greater detail above, the Company has focused its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in three areas: Our People, Our Product & Customers and Our Purchasing – through its launch of EPIC. With the involvement of the Company’s employees, EPIC is advancing efforts in each of these areas to identify and implement opportunities for the Company to address equity, partnership and inclusion issues in its business activities.
