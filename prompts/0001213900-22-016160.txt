ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a biotechnology company focused on the research and discovery of new and effective treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Epidemiological data indicate neuropsychiatric disorders as being some of the most prevalent, devastating, and yet poorly treated illnesses.



Our biotech operations focus on developing drugs that target the pathophysiology underlying such disorders rather than symptomatic treatments, with the goal of developing new pharmacological agents that display significant advantages over conventional therapies with respect to efficacy and tolerability. We particularly focus on the cross-talk between the immune system and brain disorders and how immune dysregulation affects CNS function.



For many years the brain was considered an “immune-privileged” organ. The anatomical and physiological characteristics of the central nervous system, in addition to the presence of the blood brain barrier, were thought to underlie slow immune reactions in the brain. However, according to a 2020 article published by Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, a 2020 article published by Nature Reviews Immunology, a 2019 article published by Frontiers in Immunology, and a 2020 article published by Frontiers Pharmacology, recent studies have shown substantial progress in the understanding of neuroimmune interactions, and there is now strong evidence for a close and bi-directional communication between nerve and immune cells. Altered communication between the immune and nervous system is emerging as a common hallmark in neuro-developmental, neurodegenerative, and neuro-immunological diseases. On the one hand, the brain is able to modulate the immune response through the connections between the autonomic nervous system (parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves) and lymphoid organs. Furthermore, brain hormones such as corticotrophin-releasing hormone and substance P can regulate cytokine levels. On the other hand, the immune system regulates the brain through its modulation of microglia cells and the release of peripheral cytokines, a phenomenon referred to as “cross talk” due to the close, reciprocal relationship of these two systems. Our drug discovery efforts focus on neuropsychiatric disorders that, although phenotypically distinct, are pathogenically related. We focus on mechanism-based immune treatments for the treatment of these disorders.



The first new chemical entity drug development program is focused on schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is an inherited brain disease and an incurable chronic mental disorder. With treatment, most recover from the first episode but then relapse. The pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown, while the loss of grey matter and a reduced number of synaptic structures on neurons are evident. Converging lines of genetic, epidemiological and clinical evidence indicate that inflammatory pathways are altered in schizophrenia. Studies in numerous scientific journals, including a 2013 study from the Journal of Psychiatric Research, a 1998, 2005 and a 2014 study from the Schizophrenia Research, a 2015 study from the Journal of Psychiatry & Neuro Science, a 2009 study from Molecular Psychiatry and a 2004 study from the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry have repeatedly shown that patients with schizophrenia have increased serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Several other studies in scientific journals, including a 1997 study from Psychiatry Research, a 2016 study from Nature and a 2012 study from Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria, have also reported increased complement gene expression, protein concentration, and overall activity in the serum or plasma of schizophrenia cases compared to controls. Taken together, this evidence has led to the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a neuroimmune disorder mediated by alterations in pro- and anti-inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS). We are currently developing a brain-penetrant small molecules able to down regulate a novel neuroinflammatory pathway for the systemic treatment of schizophrenia. The work is currently being conducted by Evotec, utilizing Evotec’s integrated research and development expertise and state-of-the-art structure-based drug design techniques.



The second new chemical entity drug development program is focusing in a tolerizing vaccine in Multiple Sclerosis. Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has long been postulated to trigger multiple sclerosis (MS) and recent data, according to a 2022 article published by Science, in a cohort of >10 million people have provided compelling evidence to show that EBV is the trigger for the development of MS. Furthermore, in a 2022 article published by Nature, the mechanism through which EBV mediate MS development was elucidated. Through a process of molecular mimicry, antibodies targeting EBNA-1 residues 386–405 that cross-react with the CNS cell adhesion molecule, glialCAM, Preclinical work is currently being conducted at Hooke Laboratories, a full-service Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) with deep experience in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (“EAE”), the standard animal model of MS.



Our secondary operations are focused on providing business support services to anti-depression clinics in the U.K. and in the United States.

We believe that the current treatments for mental health disorders, such as depression, are inadequate and that conventional medicines have low success rates in long-term treatment. According to an article published by PLOS One, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressants were only effective for 42-51% of patients with MDD. For example, current pharmacotherapies for MDD and BDep have a distinct lag of onset that can generate further distress and impairment in patients. According to an article published in 2000 by The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, and an article published in 2010 by Pharmaceuticals (Basel), available antidepressant medications usually take several weeks before patients display significant therapeutic benefit. This delayed onset of treatment can result in increased morbidity and increased risk for suicidal behavior. This has been reported in a base population study including 159,810 users of 4 antidepressant drugs showing that the risk of suicidal behavior increased in the first month after starting antidepressants, and in particular during the first 1 to 9 days, regardless of the chemical class of antidepressant. This study was published in a 2004 article published by The Journal of the American Medical Association. Similarly, other studies including a 2006 article published by The American Journal of Psychiatry have shown a significantly higher risk of suicide attempts during the first week of antidepressant treatment compared to subsequent weeks. Furthermore, depressive symptoms are commonly known to affect the ability of patients to function across multiple domains, impacting self-esteem, motivation and cognitive function. Delayed onset of antidepressants contributes to ongoing functional impairment and may interfere with integration back into daily life, in turn delaying full functional recovery. Furthermore, according to a 2012 article published by Biological Psychiatry and a 2013 article published by Brain Stimulation, the continued presence of depressive symptoms may promote chronic neuronal loss and suppress neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Traditional psychiatric drugs can also cause side effects. Furthermore, the approval of psychotropic drugs with novel mechanisms of action has been rare in recent years.



Our operations in the U.K. involve providing business support services to registered healthcare providers who assess patients, and if appropriate, administer intravenous infusions of ketamine, and our operations in the United States involve providing business support services to entities that furnish similar services to patients who personally pay for those services. Operations currently take place in several districts of London in the United Kingdom. We intend to commence operations in the United States, with operations in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. In addition, we intend to expand our coverage to other jurisdictions in the United States, including Florida and Nevada. We operate through partnerships with healthcare companies, including with Zen Healthcare and The IV Doc. Our operations in the U.K., and our future operations in the United States, are limited to providing business support services to healthcare companies. In the United States, certain of these business support services are subcontracted to The IV Doc through a Business Support Services Subcontract. We do not provide professional medical services, establish or own anti-depression clinics, provide psychiatric assessments, or are responsible for the administration of intravenous infusions of ketamine in the United States. Furthermore, we do not obtain or administer ketamine, nor will we maintain any license or registration to own, maintain or dispense controlled substances in the U.K. or in the United States. We provide business support services to properly authorized companies that provide clinical services of the type described above to self-pay patients, and we subcontract certain of these business support services to The IV Doc.



Ketamine was first introduced to the medical community as a surgical anesthetic more than 50 years ago. According to a 2015 article published by Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease, and a 2019 article published on the Harvard Medical School’s website, as of the date of this 10-K, ketamine is gaining grounds as a promising treatment for some cases of major depression. It works differently than traditional antidepressants, which target the brain’s serotonin and noradrenalin systems. Ketamine blocks NMDA, a receptor in the brain that is activated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter. A single subanesthetic dose infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to have potentially rapid and potent antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant MDD as well as for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

While not approved by the FDA or the MHRA to treat depression, and while recreational use remains prohibited, ketamine has been repurposed for the treatment of MDD. As detailed below, the use of ketamine has been subject to consensus statements by the APA Council of Research Task Force on Novel Biomarkers and Treatments, the Royal College of Psychiatrists Committee on Electroconvulsive Therapy and Related Treatments, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Committee for Evidence-Based Practice, and by an international expert opinion paper published in the American Journal of Psychiatry that was written by an international group of mood disorder experts:





● | APA Council of Research Task Force on Novel Biomarkers and Treatments - A Consensus Statement on the Use of Ketamine in the Treatment of Mood Disorders Council of Research Task Force on Novel Biomarkers and Treatments (April 2017) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The report highlights the current state of the field and the critical issues to be considered when contemplating the use of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression but has not been endorsed or promulgated as policy by the APA. Pursuant to the report, it is recommended that each patient undergo a thorough pre-treatment evaluation process and that the strongest data supporting ketamine’s clinical benefit in psychiatric disorders are in the treatment of major depressive episodes without psychotic features. The report states that most clinical trials and case reports available have used the ketamine hydrochloride dose of 0.5 mg/kg per 40 minutes IV. It has also been noted that at this dose, ketamine does not appear to have any significant effects on the respiratory status of healthy individuals or patients with depression who are otherwise generally healthy. However, ketamine treatment can have meaningful effects on blood pressure and heart rate, and it is recommended that clinicians delivering ketamine treatment be prepared to manage potential cardiovascular events should they occur. It is further recommended that clinicians be familiar with behavioral management of patients with marked mental status changes and be prepared to treat any emergency behavioral situations. Additionally, it is recommended that clinicians develop some level of experience before performing the procedure independently. Furthermore, it is recommended that site-specific standard operating procedures be developed and followed for the delivery of ketamine treatments. The report highlights that the existing data surrounding the benefits of repeated infusions of ketamine remain limited. The report notes that most other articles describing the effects of repeated ketamine treatments show the largest benefits occurring early in the course of treatment, but some reports have shown cumulative benefit of continued treatment. Finally, the report suggests that assessments of cognitive function, urinary discomfort, and substance use should be considered if repeated administrations are provided.

● | Royal College of Psychiatrists Committee on Electroconvulsive Therapy and Related Treatments - Statement on Ketamine to Treat Depression (February 2017) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In this statement, the authors indicate that ketamine for the treatment of depression is a novel treatment. Pursuant to the statement, it is recommended that the treating psychiatrist should consider this treatment as novel or innovative, which should include discussion with peers (preferably including a second opinion). Additionally, the statements notes that individuals considering ketamine as a treatment and their caregivers should be provided with clear information and an explanation that this is a novel treatment. This information should include a detailed explanation of the current evidence and potential risks, and be documented in the clinical notes. The statement recommends that ketamine treatment for depression occurring outside formal research studies should be coordinated across centers using a regular mood monitoring framework.

● | Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Committee for Evidence-Based Practice - Use of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (November 2019) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In this clinical memorandum, the authors highlight that there is currently limited evidence to recommend ketamine as a viable treatment option for treatment-resistant depression. Short-term efficacy has been demonstrated after a single treatment, but benefits are not lasting for most patients. The memorandum recommends that psychiatrists considering prescribing ketamine for a patient with treatment-resistant depression (outside of a research trial) should ensure the patient is willing and able to consent and should discuss this treatment with peers, preferably including a second opinion, and/or institutional review by a medicines advisory committee or medicines assessment advisory committee.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | This report provides practitioners with a synthesis of the current knowledge as it relates to ketamine’s pharmacology, efficacy, tolerability, and safety and reviews the clinical aspects related to administration of ketamine at point of care. In their consensus statement, the authors note that evidence supports the rapid-onset (i.e., within 1–2 days) efficacy of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression and that efficacy is best established for intravenous ketamine with insufficient evidence for oral, subcutaneous, or intramuscular administration. Additionally, the article indicates that evidence for long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression is insufficient. The statement identifies safety concerns with respect to ketamine, which include but are not limited to, psychiatric (e.g., dissociation, psychotomimetic), neurologic/cognitive, genitourinary, and hemodynamic effects. Pursuant to the article, it is recommended that ketamine be administered only in settings with multi-disciplinary personnel, including those with expertise in the assessment of mood disorders.

● | In 2013, a randomized, controlled trial of a single infusion of ketamine compared to an active placebo control condition, the anesthetic midazolam on treatment-resistant MDD was performed by Murrough JW, Iosifescu DV, Chang LC, Al Jurdi RK, Green CE, Perez AM, Iqbal S, Pillemer S, Foulkes A, Shah A, Charney DS, Mathew SJ. The study lasted 4 weeks and included 72 patients, who received 0.5mg/kg IV infusion or active placebo (midazolam). The clinical response was defined as greater than 50% improvement from baseline in the score on the MADRS. The results of the study showed response rates at 24h were 64% in the ketamine group and 28% in the placebo group. There were 2 serious adverse events that occurred during the study. Patient 1’s adverse event occurred on the day of infusion and consisted of hypotension (BP=73/40 for 1 min)/bradycardia (HR <30 bpm for 30 sec, followed by spontaneous recovery). This occurred while the subject was undergoing venipuncture at the 30 min time point and was considered a vaso-vagal episode. According to the study physician, there was a possible relation to study drug. Patient 2’s adverse event occurred during the washout phase and consisted of a suicide attempt while tapering off of psychotropic medication. The patient was hospitalized following the attempted overdose. According to the study physician, there was no relation to study drug.

About Our Target Market



According to the National Institute of Mental Health, mental illnesses are common in the United States. Mental illnesses include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe. Two broad categories can be used to describe these conditions: AMI and SMI. AMI encompasses all recognized mental illnesses, whereas SMI is a smaller and more severe subset of AMI.

In 2019, there were an estimated 51.5 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with AMI. Among the 51.5 million adults with AMI, 23.0 million (44.8%) received mental health services in the past year. In 2019, there were an estimated 13.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with SMI, which represented 5.2% of all U.S. adults. Out of the 13.1 million adults with SMI, 8.6 million (65.5%) received mental health treatment in the past year.



A 2004 article published in the bulletin of the WHO suggests that many people with depression do not receive treatment, and that the “treatment gap” for major depression was 45.4% in the WHO European Region and 56.9% in the Americas. A comprehensive study of such undertreatment published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in 2017 showed that 1 in 5 patients with MDD in high-income countries and 1 in 27 in low-income countries received minimally adequate treatment and that only a minority of those with MDD, generally, receive either minimally adequate counseling, psychotherapy or antidepressant therapy. In addition, according to an article published by Cambridge University Press in 2018, the overall drop-out rate, or percentage of drop-outs from out-patient mental healthcare in WHO’s Mental Health Survey initiative, sits at 31.7%.



According to BlueCross BlueShield, diagnosis of major depression in the US increased 33% between 2013 and 2016, and the rate is rising even faster among millennials (up to 47%) and adolescents (up to 47% for boys and 65% for girls). Further, a 2020 report published by Reports and Data indicates that the global anxiety and depression treatment market is anticipated to grow at a rate of 2.4% from $15.85 billion in 2019 to $19.21 billion in 2027, and that the market is mainly driven by the increasing prevalence of mental health issues like anxiety disorder and depression. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, mental health conditions alone will account for the loss of $16.1 trillion over a span of 20 years, from 2010 to 2030, with dramatic impact on productivity and quality of life.



According to the Mayo Clinic, treatment for mental illness largely depends on the type of mental illness and its severity. Currently, treatment can include psychiatric medication (such as anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs), psychotherapy, brain-stimulation treatments, hospitalization, substance misuse treatment, or any combination of the foregoing.

We incurred offering costs of $3,445,200, consisting of $2,137,800 of underwriting fees and expenses and $1,307,400 of costs related to the Initial Public Offering.



In October 2021, services commenced under the terms of an agreement entered into between our wholly owned UK subsidiary, Pasithea Therapeutics Limited (“Pasithea UK”) and Purecare Limited (operating as Zen Knightsbridge Clinic) on 31 December 2020 and amended and re-stated on 4 August 2021 (the “Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement”). 



In December 2021, services commenced under the terms of an agreement entered into between Pasithea UK and Portman Limited (operating as Zen Baker Street Clinic) on 31 December 2020 and amended and re-stated on 4 August 2021 (the “Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement”).



On November 17, 2021, we announced that Pasithea Clinics Corp. (“Pasithea Clinics”), our wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, intends to begin operations providing business support services to registered healthcare providers who assess patients and, if appropriate, administer intravenous infusions of ketamine in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, offering in-home IV ketamine therapy to patients in those cities. On December 1, 2021, Pasithea Clinics announced its intention to expand its business support services to clinics in Nevada, and to offer, through registered healthcare providers, in-home IV ketamine therapy in the United States to patients in Florida, and Pasithea Clinics is exploring potential licensure necessary for the provision of such services. On January 26, 2022, Pasithea Clinics announced it intends to provide business support services at in-person clinics operated by registered healthcare providers in the United States, in the Los Angeles area during the second quarter of 2022.

On November 29, 2021, we consummated the November 2021 Private Placement, pursuant to which we issued 8,680,000 PIPE Shares and 8,680,000 Warrants to 21 institutional investors. The offering price per PIPE Share and accompanying Warrant was $3.50, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $30,380,000. 



On February 3, 2022, we announced a new chemical entity (“NCE”) development program aimed at developing a tolerizing vaccine for multiple sclerosis (“MS”). As part of this NCE development program, we named Hooke Laboratories as our research partner. 



On March 8, 2022, we announced a partnership with The Glimpse Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRAR), a virtual reality (“VR”) and augmented reality platform company. Pursuant to this partnership, we will co-develop with The Glimpse Group, Inc. (and its subsidiary Foretell Reality) VR-environments that will assist in our treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders. 



Services



Our secondary operations in the U.K., and our intended secondary operations in the United States, are focused on providing business support services to anti-depression clinics. Our operations in the U.K. involve providing business support services to registered healthcare providers who assess patients, and if appropriate, administer intravenous infusions of ketamine, and our intended operations in the United States involve providing business support services to entities that furnish similar services to patients who personally pay for those services. Operations initially take place across the United States and the U.K. through partnerships with healthcare companies, including Zen Healthcare and The IV Doc. Our operations in the U.K. are, and our intended operations in the United States will be, limited to providing business support services to healthcare companies. In the United States, certain of these business support services will be subcontracted to The IV Doc through a Business Support Services Subcontract. (See “Business – License Agreements and Strategic Collaboration”) We do not provide professional medical services, establish or own anti-depression clinics, provide psychiatric assessments, or be responsible for the administration of intravenous infusions of ketamine in the United States. Furthermore, we do not obtain or administer ketamine, nor do we maintain any license or registration to own, maintain or dispense controlled substances in the U.K. or in the United States. We provide business support services to properly authorized companies that provide clinical services of the type described above to self-pay patients, and we subcontract certain of these business support services to The IV Doc.



United Kingdom. In the U.K., we have established Pasithea Therapeutics Limited as a wholly owned subsidiary  to provide business support to ketamine services providers. As of December 31, 2021, Pasithea Therapeutics Limited had hired one employee who is responsible for marketing. Our U.K. branch has already partnered with Purecare Limited and Portman Health Ltd, which own Zen Healthcare, a general practice group with two locations in London: Knightsbridge and Baker Street. Zen Healthcare clinics treat patients, including providing psychiatric consultations, and have pharmacies that procure, handle, and administer ketamine in treatment rooms, providing all pharmaceuticals and equipment necessary for the assessment of patients and the provision of the Treatments. Zen Healthcare has been operating for five years and has approximately 30,000 patients. Its practices give us immediate exposure in the U.K.. Other advantages include gaining access to an existing management structure and qualified general practitioners, pharmacists, therapists, and psychotherapists.



During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement with Purecare, as amended and restated on August 4, 2021, and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement with Portman, as amended and restated on August 4, 2021. Under the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, Purecare and Portman provide consulting and treatment rooms, apply for and maintain CQC registrations, employ or engage licensed and qualified staff, assess patients and, if appropriate, administer the Treatments, maintain equipment and provide all ketamine and other pharmaceuticals necessary for the Treatments at the Zen Knightsbridge Clinic and the Zen Baker Street Clinic, respectively. Under the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, we, among other things, market the Treatments to the extent permitted under law, arrange and pay for the fit-out of the consulting room, provide equipment necessary for the Treatments, develop, operate and maintain a booking website for the Treatments, make bookings and take payments, and employ or engage customer services advisers to liaise with clinical staff and pay certain staff costs. Under both the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, we receive 30% of all revenues less certain clinical staff costs which results from the provision of the Treatments provided at the Zen Knightsbridge Clinic and the Zen Baker Street Clinic. Services commenced in October 2021 and December 2021 under the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement respectively. (See “Business – License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations).

Our Chief Operating Officer, Head of U.K. Clinics and Director, Dr. Yassine Bendiabdallah, is a co-founder, current managing director, and 25% shareholder of Purecare. Dr. Bendiabdallah is also a co-founder and 16.25% shareholder of Portman. (See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”)



Our risks are mostly related to our reliance on ketamine as a key aspect of treatment because (i) ketamine is a controlled substance, (ii) ketamine would be prescribed for an unlicensed therapeutic indication, (iii) ketamine requires specific manufacture, storing, promotion and administration compliance, and (iv) ketamine poses certain clinical risks to patients.



First, in the U.K., ketamine is a Schedule II controlled substance under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 and is controlled with regard to synthesis, storage and distribution as a Class B substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as amended. Possession of ketamine requires Home Office licensing and may only be stored on premises complying with professional strictures of the GPhC. As a controlled substance, ketamine requires production and supply from a manufacturer possessing MHRA manufacturing authorization which ensures the production of GMP quality ketamine. Additionally, like in the US, because IV ketamine has not yet been granted marketing authorization for the psychotherapy indication in the U.K., it must be regarded as an unlicensed medicine that is being used off label without its authorized indications for anesthesia and/or chronic pain. The GMC code of good practice allows a physician to prescribe an unlicensed medicine under his own responsibility and they will be required to abide by their professional regulatory requirements.



Moreover, English laws restrict the offering of inducements to persons qualified to prescribe medicinal products. The Human Medicines Regulations 2012, at Regulation 300(1), make it a criminal offence for a person, in connection with the promotion of medicinal products to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, to supply, offer or promise to such persons any gift, pecuniary advantage or benefit unless it is inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. It is also an offence for any person qualified to prescribe or supply medicines to solicit or accept any gift, pecuniary advantage or benefit in kind (Regulation 300(4)). The Bribery Act 2010, which provides a legal framework to combat bribery in the public and private sectors, includes criminal offenses covering the offering, promising or giving of an advantage, and requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting of an advantage; bribing a foreign public official and the corporate offense of failing to prevent bribery. A company will be found liable of committing this offence if an “associated person” performing services on its behalf bribes another person to obtain or retain business or a business advantage. The definition of associated persons is broad and will capture many business relationships, including joint venture partners, introducers and other intermediaries. The associated individual or entity that carries out the act of bribery on behalf of the organization need not have any connection to the U.K.. The SFO, which enforces the Bribery Act, will typically not seek to prosecute unless it considers that to do so is in the public interest; and in reaching that decision it would have regard to any relevant action already taken by the MHRA and the PMCPA. Further, the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, at Regulation 284, prohibit the publishing of any advertisement that is likely to lead to the use of a prescription only medicine such as ketamine.



Under English law, the provision of health and care services is a regulated activity and requires registration with the Care Quality Commission. The provision of regulated activities without registration is an offence .



Specifically, in the UK, we currently operate under Zen Healthcare’s CQC registration and regulatory approvals and will have no independent employees providing health services.




Therefore, the associated risk factors relating to our ownership and operation of outpatient clinics dispensing and prescribing intravenous infusions of ketamine in the U.K. include that the MHRA may not approve manufacturing authorization for the production site responsible for production of ketamine; product defects may cause liabilities under civil law for negligence and products liability under the Consumer Protection Act 1987; clinics or the medical staff operating the clinics may not be able to comply with regulatory requirements and standards of performance demanded by the CQC and the GMC code of practice; similarly the operation of the clinics themselves may not comply with CQC rules on hygiene and safety; we may be found not to comply with the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 with respect to advertising requirements (including the prohibition of any advertisement that is likely to lead to the use of a prescription only medicine) or the Advertising Standards Authority standards and rules (The MHRA Blue Guide on Advertising and Promotion of Medicines in the U.K. Third Edition 2020) with regard to promotion and marketing of medicinal products; we and/or associated persons may be found to not be compliant with the Bribery Act 2010; and the prescription of ketamine for the unlicensed indication of acute depressive illness may increase prevalence of serious adverse events during the post marketing vigilance of the new formulation, damaging the commercial reputation of our potential products.

United States (including New York and California). In New York and California, we have established business support services agreements (BSSAs) with a California independent professional services company and an independent professional services company in New York that is organized and established under the laws of the state of New York. The independent professional services companies, through their employed or contracted medical providers (i.e., physicians and nurses), will provide clinical services. Individual clinicians, including psychiatrists, anesthesiologists, and nurses, all licensed and qualified to provide clinical services, will contract with the independent professional services companies to provide their services. Through our business support services agreements, we, in conjunction with The IV Doc, will provide non-clinical business support services necessary for the professional services companies to operate, including administrative services, information technology services and marketing services, online advertising, and other channels, in exchange for a flat fee.



Pasithea Clinics, an affiliate of the Company, has entered into a BSSA with the following professional corporations: Nadelson Medical PLLC and Nadelson Medical of CA, P.C. Elliot J. Nadelson, MD, is the sole owner of Nadelson Medical PLLC and Nadelson Medical of CA, P.C. These professional corporations are separate and independent entities from Pasithea Clinics, and have been organized consistent with the state professional licensing laws, including fee-splitting prohibitions, and all requirements for establishment of professional corporations in their respective states. The BSSA sets forth the details of the support services which will include non-medical administrative, financial, human resources, technology, and legal services to the professional corporations. Any service fees will be based on fair market value for the services Pasithea Clinics provides and no professional fees will be shared with Pasithea Clinics by the professional corporations.



As noted above, we have partnered with The IV Doc, a leading provider of administrative and support services to affiliated clinical practices providing intravenous infusions. Adam J. Nadelson, MD, serves as the Chief Executive Officer of The IV Doc and also holds voting power over the Living Trust of Adam Nadelson, a minority stockholder in the Company. (See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”) The IV Doc itself and through clinical affiliates has treated over 50,000 patients over the past seven years and has developed significant business support resources. The IV Doc has established relationships with over 800 clinicians in the intravenous infusion space. Through these efforts, The IV Doc has developed a national reputation for the provision of in-home infusion services, testing, and outpatient medical care. Pursuant to the Business Support Services Subcontract, we have access to The IV Doc’s business support resources, which will allow us to provide superior business support services to the professional services companies with which we contract. We expect The IV Doc’s business support resources will facilitate the efficient expansion of our intended operations in New York and Los Angeles to other locations utilizing The IV Doc business support services to assist their patient service delivery model, including The IV Doc software and technology and clinical services management resources.



We provide business support services to one or more professional services companies that utilize psychiatrists to perform diagnostic services and anesthesiologists to administer IV ketamine. Our business support services agreements require all independent practices receiving our business support services to ensure all clinicians possess and maintain all applicable state and local licenses during the course of their employment or contractual obligations. At this time, we do not plan on entering into business support services agreements with professional services companies that receive third-party reimbursement for their services.



In the United States, the FDA, the DEA and state agencies regulate the use, maintenance and distribution of ketamine. At the federal level, the FDA has approved ketamine for use as an anesthetic but not for subanesthetic intravenous administration for psychotherapy. However, in general, physicians may prescribe FDA-approved drugs for conditions other than what the drugs have been explicitly approved for (off-label use). Once a drug such as ketamine is approved for any use, physicians may prescribe those drugs for off-label uses consistent with applicable state medical practice requirements (see below). The DEA, under the federal Controlled Substance Act, oversees the maintenance and distribution of all controlled substances, including ketamine. Depending on the specific clinical protocols and standards established by the independent professional services company and the contracted or employed physicians prescribing and administering ketamine, the entity and/or the contracted or employed physicians will be required to comply with all DEA requirements. Our business support services agreements require all independent practices receiving our business support services to ensure the entity and/or the contracted or employed physicians comply with all DEA requirements.



Our business support services arrangements are subject to state laws, including those in certain of the states where we operate, which prohibit the practice of medicine by, and/or the splitting of professional fees with, non-professional persons or entities such as general business corporations. Corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions vary widely from state to state. In addition, such prohibitions are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Our failure to comply with state regulations could lead to adverse action against us and/or our providers by courts or state agencies, civil or criminal penalties, loss of provider licenses, or the need to restructure our business model and/or physician relationships, any of which could harm our business.

Under our BSSAs we provide various administrative and operations support services in exchange for scheduled fees at the fair market value of our services provided to each professional services company. As a result, our ability to receive cash fees from the professional services companies is limited to the fair market value of the services provided under the BSSAs. To the extent our ability to receive cash fees from the professional services companies is limited, our ability to use that cash for growth, debt service or other uses may be impaired and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.



Our ability to perform business support services in a particular U.S. state is directly dependent upon the applicable laws governing the practice of medicine, healthcare delivery and fee splitting in such locations, which are subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. The extent to which a U.S. state considers particular actions or contractual relationships to constitute the practice of medicine is subject to change and to evolving interpretations by medical boards and state attorneys general, among others, each of which has broad discretion. There is a risk that U.S. state authorities in some jurisdictions may find that our relationships with professional services companies violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. Accordingly, we must monitor our compliance with laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate on an ongoing basis, and we cannot provide assurance that our activities and arrangements, if challenged, will be found to be in compliance with the law. Additionally, it is possible that the laws and rules governing the practice of medicine and fee splitting in one or more jurisdictions may change in a manner adverse to our business. While our BSSAs prohibit us from controlling, influencing or otherwise interfering with the practice of medicine at each professional services company, and provide that licensed physicians retain exclusive control and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services, we cannot assure you that our contractual arrangements and activities with the professional services companies are free from scrutiny from U.S. state authorities, including the possibility that a U.S. state regulatory authority would find that the BSSAs create an impermissible delegation of clinical control by a physician practice to an unlicensed person. We further cannot guarantee that subsequent interpretation of the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws will not circumscribe our business operations. Further, notwithstanding our belief that the professional corporations have been organized and operate consistent with all applicable laws, these risks may be heightened due to the immediate familial relationship between Adam J. Nadelson, MD, the Chief Executive Officer of The IV Doc and the individual with voting power of the Living Trust of Adam Nadelson, a minority stockholder in the Company, and Elliot J. Nadelson, MD, the sole shareholder of each of Nadelson Medical PLLC and Nadelson Medical of CA, P.C. State corporate practice of medicine doctrines also often impose penalties on physicians themselves for aiding the corporate practice of medicine, which could discourage providers from participating in our network of physicians. If a successful legal challenge or an adverse change in relevant laws were to occur, and we were unable to adapt our business model accordingly, our operations in affected jurisdictions would be disrupted, which could harm our business.



Any material changes in our relationship with or among the professional services companies, whether resulting from a dispute among the entities, a challenge from a governmental regulator, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these relationships or contracts with the professional services companies, could impair our ability to provide services to the professional services companies and could harm our business. Any scrutiny, investigation or litigation with regard to our arrangements with professional services companies, and any resulting penalties, including monetary fines and restrictions on or mandated changes to our current business and operating arrangements, could harm our business.



Moreover, identifying professional services companies, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be more effective in executing such relationships and performing against them. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with professional services companies, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our net revenue could be impaired and our results of operations may suffer.



Financial Overview



We have experienced losses since inception and, at December 31, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $2.2 million. We expect to incur additional losses in the future and expect cumulative losses to increase. In January 2021, we received approximately $1.2 million in equity financing in connection with which we issued 635,594 shares of Common Stock to 29 accredited investors through a series of financings conducted pursuant to the Rule 506(b) Regulation D “safe harbor” for the private offering exemption of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act completed in January 2021. On September 17, 2021, we sold 4,800,000 Units in our Initial Public Offering at a price of $5.00 per Unit for a total of $24,000,000. We incurred offering costs of $3,445,200, consisting of $2,137,800 of underwriting fees and expenses and $1,307,400 of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. On November 29, 2021, we consummated the November 2021 Private Placement, pursuant to which we issued 8,680,000 PIPE Shares and 8,680,000 Warrants to 21 institutional investors. The offering price per PIPE Share and accompanying Warrant was $3.50, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $30,380,000.

Competition in our Pharmaceutical Model



The pharmaceutical market for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics. A number of these marketed antidepressants will be generic, and would be key competitors to our future drug candidates. These products include Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Spravato (esketamine), Forest Laboratory’s Lexapro/Cipralex (escitalopram) and Viibryd (vilazodone), Pfizer, Inc.’s Zoloft (sertraline), Effexor (venlafaxine) and Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), GlaxoSmithKline plc’s Paxil/Seroxat (paroxetine), Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac (fluoxetine) and Cymbalta (duloxetine), AstraZeneca plc’s Seroquel (quetiapine) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s Abilify (aripiprazole), among others.



We anticipate that competition in our industry will increase. In addition, the health care industry is characterized by rapid technological change, resulting in new product introductions and other technological advancements. Our competitors may develop and market products that render future product candidates, or any products manufactured or marketed by us, non-competitive or otherwise obsolete.



Intellectual Property



We currently do not hold any intellectual property, but intend to develop product candidates that may be the subject of future patent applications.



TraDigital Services Agreement



On September 18, 2021, the Company entered into a services agreement with TraDigital Marketing Group (“TraDigital”) pursuant to which TraDigital provide consulting services from September 18, 2021 through December 17, 2021 (the “Services Agreement”). The Services Agreement included a prepaid cash consulting fee of $394,000, payable and paid upon the agreement date; the Company expensed the total amount over the term of the agreement as selling, general and administrative expense as of December 31, 2021. The Services Agreement also includes 150,000 common shares of the Company due and earned upon the agreement date of September 18, 2021.
License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations



Zen Clinics



During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement, as amended and restated on August 4, 2021, with Purecare, a company that operates the Zen Knightsbridge Clinic, whereby both parties have agreed to collaborate on the provision of Treatments at Purecare’s London based clinic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, as amended and restated on August 4, 2021, with Portman, a company that operates the Zen Baker Street Clinic, whereby both parties have agreed to collaborate on the provision of Treatments at Portman’s London based clinic.





11







Under the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, Purecare and Portman provide consulting and treatment rooms, apply for and maintain CQC registrations, employ or engage licensed and qualified staff, assess patients and, if appropriate, administer the Treatments, maintain equipment and provide all ketamine and other pharmaceuticals necessary for the Treatments at the Zen Knightsbridge Clinic and the Zen Baker Street Clinic, respectively. Under the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, we, among other things, market the Treatments to the extent permitted under law, arrange and pay for the fit-out of the consulting room, provide equipment necessary for the Treatments, develop, operate and maintain a booking website for the Treatments, make bookings and take payments, and employ or engage customer services advisers to liaise with clinical staff and pay certain staff costs. Under both the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, we receive 30% of all revenues less certain clinical staff costs which results from the provision of the Treatments provided at the Zen Knightsbridge Clinic and the Zen Baker Street Clinic. The initial term of the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continues in effect for an initial term of two years and thereafter continues unless terminated on three months’ notice by either party provided that this notice of termination may not be given during the initial term. Each party may terminate the Amended and Restated Zen Knightsbridge Collaboration Agreement and the Amended and Restated Zen Baker Street Collaboration Agreement, as applicable, immediately at any time by giving written notice to the other party upon the occurrence of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the other party committing any default, breach or fraud, or the other party suspending or ceasing to carry on all or a substantial part of its business.



The IV Doc



On April 9, 2021, Pasithea Clinics, entered into a Business Support Services Subcontract (the “Subcontract”) with The IV Doc, pursuant to which The IV Doc provides certain non-clinical administrative, back office, and other business support services to one or more professional medical practices in the State of New York provided under a BSSA with Pasithea Clinics. During the term of the Subcontract, Pasithea Clinics will pay The IV Doc monthly subcontract fees in consideration of the subcontract services rendered by The IV Doc. The subcontract fees, which are equal to $22,500 per month, which represents fair market value for the subcontract services and are commensurate with the subcontract services to be provided, and do not constitute an illegal fee-splitting or impermissible profit-sharing arrangement in violation of any applicable laws. In addition to the subcontract fees, Pasithea Clinics reimburses The IV Doc for all reasonable expenses, including travel, meals and lodging expenses, incurred by The IV Doc in connection with the services provided pursuant to such agreement, provided that such expenses are otherwise commercially reasonable and necessary. The initial term of the Subcontract is 15 years, and will automatically renew for successive five-year terms unless either party delivers written notice to the other party of its intent not to renew at least 180 days before the end of the initial term or unless the Subcontract is earlier terminated pursuant to the terms thereof. The Subcontract may be terminated during the term by (a) mutual agreement of the parties, (b) by Pasithea Clinics immediately and without notice upon termination of the BSSA, (c) by Pasithea Clinics immediately upon written notice if The IV Doc breaches the Subcontract and fails to cure such breach within 45 days after receiving written notice from Pasithea Clinics or if The IV Doc admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts generally when due, or (d) by The IV Doc immediately upon written notice if Pasithea Clinics breaches the Subcontract and fails to cure such breach within 45 days after receiving written notice from The IV Doc or if Pasithea Clinics admits in writing that it is unable to pay its debts generally when due.
Government Regulation and Drug Approval



Governmental Regulations 



Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as our future product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

U.S. Government Regulation



In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our future product candidates. Accordingly, we have and plan to continue to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA pathway. The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with good manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.



The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:




● | Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II. Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.

● | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.

A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase III studies but may be Phase II studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.





13







The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.



Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.



Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, within 60 days following submission, the FDA’s goal is to review applications for new molecular entities within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to a serious or life-threatening indication and demonstrates the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over currently marketed therapies, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.



After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, manufacturers are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. The holder of an approved NDA must report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for the approved product. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.



 We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our future product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.



Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs



The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.





14







A drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. In addition, a drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.



Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review designation, once an NDA or a biologics license application, or BLA, is submitted, if the drug that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.



Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.



Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.



Controlled Substances



The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.



The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence.



To conduct clinical trials with controlled substances in the United States prior to approval, each of the research sites must submit a research protocol to the DEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle and dispense the products and to obtain the product from a supplier. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the clinical trial could be significantly delayed, and the clinical trial sites could be lost. The supplier for the clinical trials must also obtain a Schedule I registration.





15







If any proposed products developed receive FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place it in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. Consequently, its manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use may be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in the loss of our DEA registration, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. In addition, the scheduling process may take one or more years, thereby delaying the launch of any product in the United States. Furthermore, if the FDA, DEA, or any foreign regulatory authority determines that any product may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate to establish whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of any proposed product.



Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s).



The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary, to ensure that the United States complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.



For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.



The DEA, and some states, also conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Facilities that conduct research, manufacture, store, distribute, import or export controlled substances must be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.



The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.



Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation



In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our future product candidates.



Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”), must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.





16







Following the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, a separate regulatory regime applies in the U.K. to clinical trials and licensing of medicines.



The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 



To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of centralized MAA. Once granted by the European Commission, the centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 



For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 



If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.



Authorization Procedures in the European Union



In all cases, the application for marketing approval requires the completion of clinical trials. Clinical trials are currently regulated under Directive 2001/20/EC. EU directives are not directly applicable in the Member States. They have to be transposed into national law. National law transposing EU directives often varies to a great extent. However, in April 2014 a new regulation on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use was adopted. Regulations are directly applicable in the Member States, so they generally lead to greater harmonization. Regulation 536/2014 (“CTR”), entered into force on in June 2014. The CTR will harmonize the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, which will contain a centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials. The exact timing of the Regulation’s application depends on confirmation of full functionality of CTIS through an independent audit.



Medicines can be authorized in the EU by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.




● | Centralized Procedure (regulated in Regulation (EC) 726/2004). Under the Centralized Procedure a so-called Community Marketing Authorization is issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The Community Marketing Authorization is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which includes the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cooperative Authorization Procedures (regulated in Directive 2001/83/EC and implemented into Member States’ national law). There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Decentralized Procedure. Using the Decentralized Procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure the applicant chooses one country as Reference Member State. The regulatory authority of the Reference Member State will then be in charge of leading the assessment of the marketing authorization application. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






17








o | Mutual Recognition Procedure. In the Mutual Recognition Procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Furthermore, there is the option to obtain a national authorization in just one Member State. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and there is a risk that products may not qualify for data exclusivity.



U.K. Regulation



The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care in the U.K. which is responsible for ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.



The MHRA has the following roles:




● | Operate post-marketing surveillance – in particular the Yellow Card Scheme – for reporting, investigating and monitoring of adverse drug reactions to medicines and incidents with medical devices. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assess and authorize medicinal products for sale and supply in the U.K. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oversee the Notified Bodies that ensure medical device manufacturers comply with regulatory requirements before putting devices on the market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operate a quality surveillance system to sample and test medicines to address quality defects and to monitor the safety and quality of unlicensed products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investigate internet sales and potential counterfeiting of medicines, and prosecute where necessary. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulate clinical trials of medicines and medical devices. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Monitor and ensure compliance with statutory obligations relating to medicines and medical devices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promote safe use of medicines and devices.

In the United Kingdom and following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, EU medicines regulation has been adopted as standalone United Kingdom legislation with some amendments to reflect procedural and other requirements with respect to marketing authorizations and other regulatory provisions.



In order to market a medicinal product in the United Kingdom, a licence or marketing authorization must be obtained from the MHRA The United Kingdom legislation includes multiple assessment routes for applications for medicinal products, including a 150-day national assessment or a rolling review application. Further, and for a transitional period until 31 December 2022, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorisation in the centralized procedure. In addition, the MHRA has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU member states.



The United Kingdom has adopted new legislation, the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 and may make changes to the licensing or authorization of medicines in the future. The separate UK authorization system, albeit with transitional recognition procedures in the UK, may lead to additional regulatory costs. In addition, further regulatory costs will be incurred with respect to the lack of mutual recognition of batch testing and related regulatory measures between the European Union and the United Kingdom.



The CQC is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care of the U.K. It regulates and inspects health and social care services in England and registration is required prior to the provision of health and care services. Further, certain drug and pharmaceutical licences and registrations may be required for the possession and/or supply of certain drugs.

The GPhC is the body responsible for the independent regulation of the pharmacy profession within Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) regulation and enforcement by, responsible for the regulation of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy premises.



Zen Healthcare has established consultants and advisors to ensure it operates in accordance with the CQC. Zen Healthcare also has responsibility under our agreements to obtain all the regulatory approvals and licenses to operate from the aforementioned bodies and complies with the MHRA, CQC and GPhC.



Other Health Care Laws



We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the US federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. The US laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician sunshine and privacy and security laws and regulations with corresponding laws in non-US countries.



The US federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.



Additionally, the US Civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the United States, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion-dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.



HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.



There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, “the Affordable Care Act”), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.2 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.





19







We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing such civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.



Coverage and Reimbursement



Sales of our product candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products and product candidates, if approved, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of products and our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our products and future product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.



In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products and future product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products or future product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products and future product candidates, if approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.



Health Care Reform



In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.



In particular, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts, which, through subsequent legislative amendments, was increased to 70%, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance were also enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities.



Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. If a law is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs. While we are unable to predict what changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that future changes affect how any future products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers our business could be adversely impacted. In November 2020, Joseph Biden was elected President and, in January 2021, the Democratic Party obtained control of the Senate. As a result of these electoral developments, it is unlikely that continued legislative efforts will be pursued to repeal ACA. Instead, it is possible that legislation will be pursued to enhance or reform ACA. We are not able to state with certainty what the impact of potential legislation will be on our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our future product candidates or additional pricing pressures.



Facilities and Operational Regulation



U.S.



Federal, state and local regulations (implemented by CMS, FDA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“OSHA”), the DEA, and state departments or boards of public health, public welfare, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and medical assistance, among others) would require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, the management, licensing, safety, security and operation of facilities (including, e.g., laboratories, pharmacies, and clinics), personnel qualifications and licensing, the maintenance of proper records, equipment, and quality assurance programs, and the dispensing, storage, and administration of controlled substances. All of our clinics and facilities in the U.S. would be subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local agencies to determine if the operations, premises, equipment, personnel and patient care meet applicable standards.



Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local hazardous and medical waste disposal laws. As currently in effect, laws governing the disposal of hazardous waste do not classify most of the waste produced in connection with the provision of our health care services as hazardous, although disposal of non-hazardous medical waste is subject to specific state regulation. Our operations are also subject to various air emission and wastewater discharge regulations.



Non-U.S.



We would be subject to a broad spectrum of regulation in other countries. Our operations must comply with various environmental and transportation regulations in the countries in which we operate. Our facilities and clinics are also subject to various standards relating to, among other things, facilities, management, personnel qualifications and licensing, maintenance of proper records, equipment, quality assurance programs, the operation of pharmacies, the protection of workers from blood-borne diseases and the dispensing of controlled substances. All of our operations may be subject to periodic inspection by various governmental authorities to determine if the operations, premises, equipment, personnel and patient care meet applicable standards. Our clinic operations and our related activities generally require licenses, which may be subject to periodic renewal and may be revoked for violation of applicable regulatory requirements.



In addition, many countries impose various investment restrictions on foreign companies. For instance, government approval may be required to enter into a joint venture with a local partner. Some countries do not permit foreign investors to own a majority interest in local companies or require that companies organized under their laws have at least one local stockholder. Investment restrictions therefore affect the corporate structure, operating procedures and other characteristics of our subsidiaries and joint ventures in these and other countries.



Human Capital Management



As of December 31, 2021, we had three full time employees, two part time employees and 7 contractors/consultants, in addition to Zen Healthcare’s staff of over 60 team members across three clinics.] None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.



We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management and research personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other medical device, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.

We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plan, pension, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and on-site services, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.



The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.



We consider our relations with our employees to be good.]



Environmental, Social and Governance Efforts 



Environmental Commitment



We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations. We monitor resource use, improve efficiency, and at the same time reduce our emissions and waste.



We are systematically addressing the environmental impacts of the buildings we own as we make improvements, including adding energy control systems and other energy efficiency measures. Waste in our own operation is minimized by our commitment to reduce both single-use plastics and operating paper-free, primarily in a digital environment. We have safety protocols in place for handling biohazardous waste in our labs, and we use third-party vendors for biohazardous waste and chemical disposal.



Social Responsibility



For third-party vendor selection and oversight, we have standard operating procedures that apply to employees and subcontractors who on our behalf, oversee and conduct research regulated by the FDA. We retain ultimate authority and responsibility for the conduct of regulated research, manufacturing, and testing and we must ensure that contracted services are conducted in accordance with Good Practice Guidelines and all applicable regulations.
Facilities



Our principal executive office is located at 1111 Lincoln Road, Suite 500, Miami Beach, FL 33139. We rent approximately 300 square feet of space, which includes our executive offices and research and development operations.
Legal Proceedings



We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings.
