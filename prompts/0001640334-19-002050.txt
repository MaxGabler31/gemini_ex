Also as used in this annual report, the term “Gen Next” refers to Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc., “FHV LLC” refers to Fresh Healthy Vending LLC, “R&I” refers to Reis & Irvy’s, Inc., “19 Degrees” refers to 19 Degrees, Inc., “Fresh and Healthy” refers to Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation, and “GNVR” refers to Generation Next Vending Robots.

Business

Generation Next Franchise Brands Inc. primarily develops and operates unattended retail platforms and related technology through franchise, licensing, wholesale, and corporate owned business models. Generally, the franchise business model allows other individuals or companies (franchisees) to own and operate businesses using the trademarks, intellectual property, expertise, ideas, and processes that are owned and developed by Generation Next or one of its subsidiaries, such as Reis & Irvy’s Inc., a franchise concept involving robotic soft serve vending robots. The Company’s segments are Reis & Irvy’s, Print Mates, Inc., and 19 Degrees, Inc.

Not all of the Company’s business opportunities will strictly involve a franchise business model. In some instances, the Company may seek to license the rights to its unattended retail technology or seek revenue from a combination of the license and sale of unattended retail technology. To date, the Company has not yet received royalties from such agreement. In other instances, the Company may license the rights to another company to become the franchisor of the Company’s franchise concepts. 

Previous to our focus on the current segments, we were a franchisor of vending machines and operator of Company-owned vending machines and micro markets that made healthy eating more convenient through access to high quality healthy foods at high foot traffic destinations. By March 2016, we began to wind down the marketing our healthy vending franchises, although we continued to support our ongoing franchisees. As of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third-party fiduciary who will liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC’s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.

We anticipate cultivating and growing other concepts that complement our existing portfolio.

History

We are a public company traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol “VEND.” We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 8, 2011 as Green 4 Media, Inc. Prior to July 19, 2013, we were an eco-marketing and advertising company (“GEEM Business”). On July 22, 2013, we entered into the Indemnity Agreement and in connection with that agreement we transferred the GEEM Business to our former Chief Executive Officer. Effective August 8, 2013, we changed the name of our Company from Green 4 Media, Inc. to Fresh Healthy Vending International, Inc., and in March 2016, we changed the name of our Company to Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc. In August 2019, shareholders approved a shortened name, Generation Next, to reflect the multiple go-to-market channels used by the Company.

FHV LLC was formed as a limited liability company in California in 2010, as a franchisor of healthy drinks and snack vending machines. Including the operating history of YoNaturals, whose assets were contributed to FHV LLC in August 2010, we have a combined nine-year operating history in vending machines providing food and beverages. Because it was determined the assets of FHV LLC are currently insufficient to satisfy FHV LLC’s obligations to creditors, as of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC’s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.

On July 19, 2013 (the “Closing Date”) our wholly-owned subsidiary, FHV Acquisition Corp., completed a Reorganization and Asset Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with FHV Holdings Corp, a California corporation (“FHV Cal”) (the “FHV Acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, we issued 15,648,298 shares of our Company’s common stock (as adjusted for the Stock Split) to FHV Cal, in exchange for all FHV Cal’s assets as of the Closing Date. FHV Cal’s principal asset consisted of the operations and assets of Fresh Healthy Vending LLC, a California limited liability company. At the closing, FHV Cal distributed the Company’s common stock to the sole shareholder of FHV Cal, a trust affiliated with Nicholas Yates.

On July 19, 2013, we also completed the sale of 2,235,951 shares of our common stock to 18 investors (“Stock Sale”) in exchange for gross proceeds totaling $1,000,000 (approximately $996,000 net of estimated related costs in connection with the transaction). In addition, on July 19, 2013, we converted $210,000 of convertible notes payable into 552,418 shares of common stock. For accounting purposes, the transaction was determined to be and accounted for as a reverse merger.

In connection with the Acquisition Agreement, we entered into a Business Transfer and Indemnity Agreement dated July 22, 2013 (the “Indemnity Agreement”) with our former Chief Executive Officer Daniel Duval providing for:


1. | The sale to Mr. Duval of our business existing on the date of the Indemnity Agreement (the “GEEM Business ”); 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The assumption by Mr. Duval of all liabilities of our Company and the indemnification by Mr. Duval holding our Company harmless for any and all liabilities arising at or before the date of the Indemnity Agreement;
3. | The payment to Mr. Duval of $191,000 in cash; and 
4. | The surrender by Mr. Duval of 11,671,713 shares of our Company’s common stock (all of which shares were cancelled by our Company).

Reis & Irvy’s Robotic Soft Serve Vending Robot

On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Robofusion, Inc. (“RFI”), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt and ice cream vending robots, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis & Irvy's (the “Acquisition”). The Company considered the guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations, and determined the transaction was a purchase of an asset. As a result, the estimated fair of the assets acquired were capitalized. The intent of the purchase was to combine robotics and artificial intelligence platforms to facilitate the manufacture of an unattended robot in order to disrupt traditional frozen yogurt and ice cream retail establishments and, on a larger scale, establish ourselves as an industry leader in the emerging and fast-growing space of unattended retail. Since acquisition, we have developed a state-of-the art robotic soft serve vending robot that is a completely unique vending machine and entertainment experience. The robot accepts cash and credit cards. A proprietary software platform is utilized that allows us to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees’ and our corporate-owned machines, which assists our franchisees and us in facilitating the management and maintenance of the vending robot. In order to protect the Company’s rights, several patents have been approved and granted. Our vending standards are UL (“Underwriters Laboratories”) (approval in process), NSF (“National Sanitation Foundation”) recognized (approved in August 2018), and National Automated Merchandising Association (“NAMA”) certified (approved in September 2018), which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. NAMA estimates that 100 million Americans will use one of seven million vending machines each day. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. Our third-party cashless payment technology provides the highest level of data and network security compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, our robotic soft serve vending robots will contain minimal amounts of cash. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations. Funds from all electronic transactions are collected by Reis & Irvy’s and remitted to the franchisee within ten days of the subsequent month. 

Reis & Irvy’s sells franchise rights, generally a 10-year term, for the use of its trademarks and technology, robotic soft serve vending robots, and secures locations for franchisee robots. Potential franchisees are interviewed by salespeople and complete a questionnaire. Those who meet certain financial criteria and deemed a good fit are provided franchising information based on their respective state’s franchise regulations, generally a Franchise Disclosure Document. After the cooling off period, approximately 14 calendar days, Reis & Irvy’s and the franchisee enter into a franchise agreement, which contains the term, sales price, location of the franchise, and each party’s rights and obligations. Reis & Irvy’s offers franchises in every state in the Unites States with the exception of South Dakota. Master franchises are offered for certain large geographic locations. To date, the Company has entered into master franchise agreements in Australia, Canada, Israel, and Oman. 

As of the date of this report, the Company sold 1,296 units representing approximately $58 million in vending machine sales and franchise fees. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company had recognized revenue on 426 kiosks equating to revenues of approximately $16.3 million from the sale of vending robots and $1.4 million in franchise fees, respectively. No non-franchise royalty revenues from licenses were earned or recognized. Further, the Company has contractual commitments for approximately 2,342 units representing approximately $92 million in potential revenue. 

In order to assist franchisees with support and pay for certain administrative costs (e.g. merchant fees, software fees, etc.) Reis & Irvy’s charges a monthly royalty fee of 12% of gross receipts. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the company recognized approximately $315,000 in franchise royalty revenue.

Franchisees are responsible for obtaining all Federal, state and local health department licenses and certifications. Further, franchisees are responsible for all routine repairs and maintenance. However, a 1-year warranty for all parts is provided, and extended warranties are available for purchase from Reis & Irvy’s.

Frozen Yogurt and Ice Cream Products

The Company has set up distribution partners to carry the consumable products required for the frozen yogurt and ice cream robots. Franchisees order consumable products directly from the distribution partners and are responsible for 
those costs. If consumable products became unavailable from the Company’s distribution partners, the Company believes a replacement would be readily available due to the homogeneous nature of the product. 
Competition

The vending industry is large and highly fragmented but consolidating. We have laid the foundation for a robust network of vending robots for our franchisees by implementing a strong business model that offers the following competitive advantages:

· | Partnering with national food service management companies such as Compass Group USA, and other large multi-site operators to provide host locations for our vending Robots. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Completing a three-year research and development cycle culminating in validated component suppliers, assembly know how, quality control procedures, and operating support systems.
· | Procuring components of the vending robot from trusted vendors with a history of high-quality products. 
· | Securing distribution of the highest quality consumable product from recognized industry leaders, such as Dannon. 
· | Issuance of U.S. patents. 

Our Principal Suppliers

The Company currently outsources contract manufacturing services for the assembly of the robotic soft serve vending kiosks. The components used in the assembly are sourced from multiple domestic and international suppliers. The use of extended payment terms and interruptions in purchasing patterns due to cash flow constraints have strained supplier relationships; however, we expect all component supplier relationships to continue. Nonetheless, we maintain contact with alternative sources to both stay attuned to economic and technical advantages we may bring into the kiosk. We are transitioning contract manufacturers after a planned exit from Flex in August 2019. We have prepared to mitigate disruptions from this change by accumulating 140 finished goods by the end of August which will be used to fill demand while the transition is completed. 

The Company has also entered into an agreement with Dannon YoCream, for Dannon YoCream to be a primary supplier of all frozen desserts available within the Reis & Irvy’s Froyo Robots, including a wide assortment of frozen yogurts, sorbets and gelatos. 

Governmental Regulation

We are required to comply with regulations governing the sale of franchises – the primary component of our business. Fifteen states directly regulate franchising and fourteen require pre-sale registration of a Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”), or offering prospectus, by the franchisor, normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state, and pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate by a franchisor before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. Franchise sales in the remaining 35 states are generally subject to the Franchise Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which requires the pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. A franchisor that fails to properly register and maintain the registration of its FDD and disclose its franchisee candidates in the 15 registration states, unless exempt from registration under a few narrowly drawn exceptions to the registration requirements, is subject to legal action by its franchisees for damages and, under certain circumstances, for rescission of the franchise agreements, and to administrative, civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed as well. The FTC’s Franchise Rule does not require registration of an FDD with the FTC. Reis & Irvy’s offers franchises in each state within the United States, with the exception of South Dakota. 

Reis & Irvy’s and franchisees are required to comply with all Federal, state and location regulations related to food handling. 

Available Information

We file various reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are available through the SEC’s electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system (“EDGAR”) by accessing the SEC’s home page (http://www.sec.gov). The documents are also available to be read or copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C., 20549. Information on the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

Our Employees

We had approximately 49 full-time employees as of June 30, 2019. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Seasonality

We do not expect that our business will experience significant seasonality due to the number and location of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robots.
