Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Cognizant is one of the world’s leading professional services companies. We are in business to help our customers adapt, compete and grow in the face of continual shifts and disruptions within their markets. We do so by partnering with them to apply technology to transform their business, operating, and technology models, allowing them to achieve the full value of digitizing their entire enterprises. We call this being “digital at scale.” When implemented, it enables customers to achieve more efficient and effective operations while reshaping their business models for innovation and growth. Our industry-based, consultative approach helps customers envision, build and run more innovative and efficient businesses. Our core competencies include: business, process, operations and technology consulting, application development and systems integration, enterprise information management, application testing, application maintenance, information technology, or IT, infrastructure services, and business process services. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries and use an integrated global delivery model that employs customer service teams based at customer locations and delivery teams located at dedicated global and regional delivery centers.
Industry Overview
In today’s fast-paced and complex business environment, most companies face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics. This more demanding environment is partially the result of the broadening use of new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, analytics, robotic process automation, cybersecurity and hybrid cloud. These technologies have become so effective at transforming business models and core processes that no large enterprise can ignore them and still remain competitive. As a result, advanced technologies are no longer only about supporting the business; increasingly, they are the business. In response, many companies now apply digital technologies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees, and to develop innovative products and services and bring them quickly to market. Companies are also eager to automate additional aspects of their business to improve their cost structures and increase the quality and velocity of their operations. Therefore, customers seek digital transformation experts who can help them reimagine, redefine, and remake their businesses and who can provide this capability through a global sourcing model.
Business Strategy
Our objective is to create value for both our customers and stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading professional services company in the digital era. Our key strategies to achieve this objective are described below.
Align Our Digital Services and Solutions Along Three Practice Areas
Our digital services and solutions are designed to help our customers win in the digital economy by applying technology and analytics to change consumer experiences to drive sustainable growth, deploying systems of intelligence to automate and improve core business processes, and improving technology systems by deploying cloud and cyber security solutions and as-a-service models to make them simpler, more modern and secure.
We have aligned our digital services and solutions into three practice areas across our four industry-oriented business segments, to mirror our clients' needs and the parts of their enterprise they need to transform. 

• | Cognizant Digital Business. Our digital business practice works with customers to envision and build human-centric digital solutions, fusing strategy, intelligence, experience and software to drive industry-aligned transformative growth. Our approach combines data science, design thinking, and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company’s offerings seamlessly across every channel. We help customers identify insights, develop business models and go-to-market strategies, and design, prototype and scale meaningful experiences.


• | Cognizant Digital Operations. Our digital operations practice helps customers re-engineer, digitize, manage and operate their most essential business processes to lower operating costs, improve user experiences and deliver better outcomes and top-line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated, data-driven platforms and industry utilities.


• | Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology. Our digital systems and technology practice helps clients create and evolve applications, platforms and infrastructure that meet the needs of modern enterprises. We work with customers to simplify, modernize and secure IT infrastructure and applications by leveraging automation, analytics and agile

development, allowing our customers to unlock the value in their legacy technology environments, adapt to change and maintain the integrity of their core IT infrastructure. We help customers create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost and flexibility.
Our global consulting team provides business, process, operations and technology consulting services to bring together the capabilities of all three of our digital practice areas into effective solutions for our customers. Our consulting professionals and domain experts from our industry-focused business segments work closely with our digital practice areas to create frameworks, platforms and solutions that customers find valuable as they pursue new efficiencies and revenue streams.
Scale Our Digital Practice Areas
We are investing to scale our digital practice areas across our business segments and geographies. We seek to drive organic growth through the extensive training and re-skilling of our technical teams and the expansion of our local workforces in the United States and other markets around the world where we operate. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and alliances that can expand our intellectual property portfolio, industry expertise, geographic reach, and platform and technology capabilities. 
In 2017, we completed several acquisitions to further enhance our digital capabilities. These include the acquisitions of Brilliant Service, a Japan-based intelligent products and solutions company; Netcentric, a leading independent Adobe partner in Europe and a leading provider of digital experience and marketing solutions for some of the world’s most recognized brands; and Zone, a UK-based leading independent, full-service digital agency that specializes in interactive digital strategy, technology and content creation. 
Continue To Develop Our Core Business
Our core business supports our ability to provide digital services and solutions to our customers. In many cases, our customers' new digital systems are built upon the backbone of their core, traditional systems. Our deep knowledge of their infrastructure and core systems provides us with a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities. Customers often look for efficiencies in the way they run their core operations so they can fund investments in new digital capabilities. We work with them to analyze and identify opportunities to apply advanced automation and deliver new efficiencies. We deploy a variety of commercial and delivery models, including managed services, fixed priced, output- and outcome-based pricing and platforms to meet their varied needs. 
Our services include consulting and technology services and outsourcing services. Consulting and technology services include business, process, operations and technology consulting, application development and systems integrations, application testing, enterprise information management and software solutions and related services. Outsourcing services include application maintenance, IT infrastructure services and business process services.
 We deliver services to our customers across our four business segments in a standardized, high-quality manner through our global delivery model. During 2017, we invested to broaden and deepen our services and capabilities and have created new tools to help our sales teams more crisply convey the distinctive value of our services to clients. At the same time, we have intensified our focus on developing industry-specific solutions across technologies.
Additionally, we seek to expand the geographic reach of our core portfolio of services. We believe that Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America will continue to present long-term growth opportunities.
Leverage Our Domain Expertise 
Our deep domain expertise in the industries we serve is central to understanding our customers' challenges and designing effective solutions to address them. We hire professionals who are industry experts and invest in continual industry training for our teams as we build out our portfolio of industry-specific services and solutions. This approach is key to our ability to develop relevant solutions that deliver measurable business results.
Utilize a Global Delivery Model
We utilize a global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide, to respond quickly to customers with high-quality services at competitive rates. Our four-tiered global architecture for service delivery and operations consists of employees co-located at customers’ sites, at local or in-country delivery centers, at regional delivery centers and at offshore delivery centers. As we develop our digital services, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries to expand our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure facilitates the seamless integration of our global workforce.
2

Across our business segments, we are highly dependent upon our foreign operations. Our delivery centers and technical professionals are positioned globally, with the majority located in India. Our operations in India and the rest of the world expose us to various risks, including regulatory, economic and political risks and instability, potentially unfavorable immigration, tax, import and export policies, fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international and civil hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics.
Deploy Customer-Centric, Collaborative Approach
We put our customers' priorities first and continuously seek to deliver not only what they need today but also what we believe they will need in the future. Our Global Technology Office and Cognizant Accelerator focus on developing innovative offerings for customers' emerging needs and support our business segments and practice areas. A cornerstone of our success is the collaboration of our associates and teams across segments and practice areas. We believe that when we share knowledge and work together, we can achieve more for our customers and our Company.
Business Segments
We are organized around and go to market across our four industry business segments:

Financial Services | Healthcare | Products and Resources | Communications, Media and Technology 
● Banking● Insurance | ● Healthcare● Life Sciences | ● Retail and Consumer Goods● Manufacturing and Logistics● Travel and Hospitality● Energy and Utilities | ● Communications and Media● Technology

Our Financial Services segment includes banking, capital markets and insurance services companies. Our Healthcare segment consists of healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies. Our Products and Resources segment includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality companies, as well as companies providing logistics and energy and utility services. Our Communications, Media and Technology segment includes information, media and entertainment, communications and technology companies.
This industry focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction. As the technology services industry continues to mature and shift from supporting the business to becoming one of the main sources of value, customers require service providers to have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their customers’ individual business needs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the distribution of our revenues across our four industry-focused business segments was as follows:
See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our business segments, including the disclosure of segment revenues, operating profit and financial information by geographic area.

Our Solutions and Services
We continually invest in the expansion of our service portfolio to anticipate and meet customers’ evolving needs. These services are delivered to our customers across our four business segments in a standardized, high-quality manner through our global delivery model. Our three digital practice areas span our portfolio of service offerings. Our current service areas include:
Consulting and Technology Services

• | Business, Process, Operations and Technology Consulting. Our global consulting team, Cognizant Consulting, helps customers re-imagine and transform their businesses to gain competitive advantage.

• | Enterprise Information Management. Our enterprise information management practice focuses on helping customers harness the vast amounts of data available on their operations, customers and markets, and convert that data into information and insights that are valuable to their businesses and can be used to drive management decisions. We help customers identify the types of data available both within their organizations and from outside sources and work to bring that data together in a meaningful “data to foresight” continuum. Among the trends driving this business are the desire of companies to better understand consumer demands and market opportunities in order to create new products and services, the need to manage reporting requirements in regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services, and the pressures to manage operations more efficiently and cost-effectively through the use of analytical tools.

Our solutions help physicians and healthcare organizations simplify business processes and execute strategies for population health management, accountable care, and value-based initiatives.
Outsourcing Services

• | Application Maintenance. Our application maintenance service offering supports some or all of a customer’s applications, ensuring that systems remain operational and responsive to changing user requirements, including the adaptation of systems to digital technologies, and provides on-going enhancements as required by the customer. Our application maintenance services enable customers to improve the overall agility, responsiveness, productivity and efficiency of their IT infrastructure and help reduce cost of ownership. As part of this process, we often introduce products and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support. Our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and cost-effective support services. Our on-site personnel often provide help-desk services at the customer’s facility. As part of our application maintenance services, we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations, new standards or other external events.

We also have cloud services offerings that utilize virtualization technologies across delivery solutions for private cloud, enterprise multi-tenant cloud and public cloud models. We provide services that harness and modernize legacy systems to be digital-ready with agility and speed without sacrificing the knowledge those systems contain. Customers are increasingly utilizing IT infrastructure services to sharpen their focus on core business operations, reallocate overhead costs to growth investments, enable businesses to respond more quickly to changing demands, decrease time to market, ensure that the IT infrastructure can scale as the business evolves and access skill sets outside the organization.

Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our global headquarters and business development offices, which are strategically located around the world. The sales and marketing group works with our customer delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider. The duration of the sales process may vary widely depending on the type and complexity of services.

Customers
The number of customers we serve has increased in recent years. As of December 31, 2017, we increased the number of our strategic customers to 357. We define a strategic customer as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. We provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. Revenues from our top customers as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:

 | For the years ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Top five customers | 8.9 | % | | 10.0 | % | 11.0 | %
Top ten customers | 14.9 | % | | 16.7 | % | 18.6 | %

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows:
