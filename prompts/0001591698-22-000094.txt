Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a leading cloud-based provider of human capital management, or HCM, and payroll software solutions that deliver a comprehensive platform for the modern workforce. Our HCM and payroll platform offers an intuitive, easy-to-use product suite that helps businesses attract and retain talent, build culture and connection with their employees, and streamline and automate HR and payroll processes. Excluding clients acquired through acquisitions, as of June 30, 2022, we provided our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions to approximately 33,300 clients across the U.S., which on average had over 100 employees. 
Effective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Organizations are faced with an ever-changing employment landscape, including numerous federal, state and local regulations across multiple jurisdictions, the complexity of increasingly geographically dispersed employees, and managing hybrid workplaces. At the same time, employees’ expectations are rising, and organizations need to prioritize communication, connection, and collaboration among their employees to differentiate how they attract and retain talent and build a culture of loyalty. Many companies also are operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel to implement or support large and complex systems in today’s dynamic environment. Existing solutions offered by third-party payroll service providers can have limited capabilities and configurability while other enterprise-focused software vendors can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to implement and manage. We believe that modern organizations are better served by SaaS solutions designed to meet their unique needs, delivering fast time to value, and providing their employees with the most engaging experience available. 
Our HCM and payroll software solutions provide the following key benefits to our clients:
•Single & Flexible End-to-End Platform - The foundation of our platform is a single employee system of record that supports the complete employee lifecycle: Talent, Payroll, Core HR, Workforce Management, and Benefits. Our platform centralizes payroll and HCM data, minimizing inconsistent and incomplete information that can be produced when using multiple databases. 
•Employee Experience –We embed employee experiences throughout the platform that help employees feel connected to their work whether they are hybrid, remote, on-the-go, or do not have computers or email addresses. Our platform provides tools to communicate, connect to organizations and peers, and focus on career development and growth, which drives engagement and adoption of self-service processes – and drives HR automation and digital transformation. 
•Insights & Recommendations – Our clients have access to their data for reporting and compliance needs, but we also provide prescriptive recommendations on how to interpret the data and where to focus next to achieve their goals. Our dashboards use advanced AI to deliver actionable next steps to improve efficiency and build a healthier workforce.
•Leading Customer Service - We supplement our comprehensive software solutions with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of our clients and prospects. 
•Seamless Integration with Extensive Ecosystem of Partners. Our software solutions offer our clients automated data integration with hundreds of third-party partner systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems. This integration reduces the complexity and risk of error of manual data transfers and saves time for our clients and their employees. We integrate data with these related systems through a secure connection, which significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized third-party access and other security breaches.
We market and sell our products through our direct sales force. We generate sales leads through a variety of focused marketing initiatives and from our extensive referral network of 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees and the amount, type and timing of services provided with respect to those client employees. Our annual revenue retention rate was greater than 92% in each of the fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Our total revenues increased from $561.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $635.6 million in fiscal 2021, representing a 13% year-over-year increase, and to $852.7 million in fiscal 2022, representing a 34% year-over-year increase. Our recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results.
Our Strategy
We intend to strengthen and extend our position as a leading provider of cloud-based HCM and payroll software solutions. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
•Extend Technological Leadership. We believe that our organically developed cloud-based software solutions, combined with our unified database architecture, enhances the experience and usability of our products, providing what we believe to be a competitive advantage over alternative solutions. Our modern, intuitive user interface utilizes features found in many popular consumer application experiences, enabling users to use our solutions with limited training. We plan to continue our technology innovation, as we have done with our mobile applications, social features and analytics capabilities.
•Grow Our Client Base. We believe that our current client base represents only a small portion of the organizations that could benefit from our solutions. Our clients typically have between 10 to 5,000 employees and while we provide our HCM and payroll software solutions to approximately 33,300 clients across the U.S. (excluding clients acquired through acquisitions) as of June 30, 2022, there are over 1.3 million businesses with 10 to 5,000 employees in the U.S., employing approximately 73 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2019. We estimate that if clients were to buy our entire suite of existing solutions at list prices, they would spend approximately $440 per employee annually. We believe our realized target addressable market is approximately $18.6 billion assuming $255 realized per employee per year as our existing clients do not typically own our entire suite of solutions. As we continue to expand our product offerings, we believe that we have an opportunity to increase the amount clients spend on HCM solutions per employee and to expand our addressable market. As we expand our client base and number of employees, we will also grow our sales organization. 
•Expand Our Product Offerings. We believe a significant part of our leadership position is the result of our investment and innovation in our product offerings. We plan to continue to invest in product development efforts that will allow us to offer a broader selection of products to new and existing clients. 
•Further Develop Our Referral Network. We have developed a strong network of referral participants, such as 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants that recommend our solutions and provide referrals. We believe that our platform’s automated data integration with hundreds of related third-party partner systems is valuable to our referral participants, as they are able to access payroll and HR data through a single system which decreases complexity and cost and complements their own product offerings. We plan to increase integration with third-party providers and expand our referral network to grow our client base and lower our client acquisition costs.

By modernizing the experience, clients can conveniently reach candidates wherever they are, including through embedded text messaging, and instantly track conversations in our platform. HR professionals can customize job applications and reach more candidates by automatically posting to online job portals. To promote an inclusive culture, clients can activate masking of certain candidate details to promote recruiting without bias, while still collecting all essential details, including diversity information. Additionally, our solution provides clients with the ability to auto-fill and simplify background checks, maintain and track personal and confidential data, and have real-time access to candidate information to enable timely staffing decisions. Recruiters can communicate with modern candidates in the ways they expect, including email and text messaging from right within our platform.

Employee Benefits Management – Clients can plan and administer competitive benefits packages in one place while offering a smooth, mobile-friendly enrollment and management experience for employees with our Employee Benefits Management tool. Benefit administrators can add enrollment rules, manage benefit offerings for different employee groups, customize user plan limits, and view plan documentation, among other features.

Third-Party Administrative (TPA) Solutions – Our TPA solutions are designed to modernize the administration of HSA, FSA, Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), Transportation Management Account (TMA) and Premium Only Plan (POP) benefits by providing users with a single, unified access point for payroll, HR, and benefits administration. Our TPA solutions include mobile and web access, allowing users to view transaction details and account balances while having the ability to submit claims from our integrated employee portal. It also eases the administration of COBRA coverage and retiree billing.
Employee Experiences
Community – Community is an integrated part of our platform that streamlines communication and fosters a culture of engagement not possible with broadcast emails, antiquated intranets or break room bulletin boards. It empowers clients to engage all employees—even those that are remote, on-the-go or do not have corporate email, which is more critical than ever in the new hybrid world of work. With Community, clients can optimize “broadcast” communications with a company feed that streamlines announcements into a single location. Announcements can be managed, sent and tracked with an intuitive dashboard. Clients can support their employees at scale with Ask an Expert groups where employees can pose questions to designated group experts who manage questions from a dashboard. Community also offers premium capabilities such as one-to-one and one-to many chat functionality to improve real-time communication; the ability to upload, create, edit, and share files; the automatic creation of team groups for supervisors and direct reports; updated user profiles allowing employees to list interests, team members, education, skills or hobbies and enhanced directory and search capability to easily find, follow and engage with co-workers. 
Premium Video – Premium Video provides clients the ability to record, upload and embed videos across our HCM platform to increase collaboration, morale, engagement and productivity. Clients can embed videos seamlessly into tasks that are critical to their business such as leadership announcements, job postings, onboarding, performance journals, surveys and more. 
Surveys – Our Surveys tool help clients gather valuable employee feedback to encourage ongoing and transparent conversations while staying in touch with their workforce.
Peer Recognition – Peer Recognition promotes positive interactions by allowing employees to recognize and celebrate colleagues’ achievements. It also gives employees the ability to post accolades on their profiles and share with co-workers. 
Insights & Recommendations
Modern Workforce Index – Leveraging data from more than 33,000 clients, our patent-pending Modern Workforce Index (MWI) puts sophisticated AI into an HR intelligence dashboard that gives clients insight into employee sentiment, performance metrics, and engagement. With MWI, clients can identify gaps and get smart, actionable recommendations on how to improve their organization’s health by increasing employee productivity and reducing turnover.
Data Insights – With our Data Insights solution, our clients can evaluate the health of their organizations with actionable insights in areas such as headcount, turnover, labor costs and composition of their employee populations so they can customize, fund and deploy strategies to support diverse employees and identify needs of underrepresented groups.
Reporting – Clients can build and customize reports within our platform. We also offer hundreds of standard reports that clients can use as is or adjust to suit their needs. New reports are added regularly in response to regulatory changes, compliance updates and client feedback.
Client Support Teams
We supplement our comprehensive software platform with an integrated implementation and client service organization with deep subject matter expertise. Our core operation consists of various specialists, including 
implementation teams, account managers, payroll processing and tax service teams. Delivering a positive experience and a high level of support is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain clients.
Implementation and Training Services
Our clients are typically either migrating to our platform from a competitive solution or are adopting their first online HCM and payroll solution. These organizations often have limited internal resources and rely on us to implement their HCM and payroll solutions. We typically implement our product suite within one to eight weeks, depending on the size and complexity of each client. Each client is guided through the implementation process by our knowledgeable consultants for all implementation matters. We believe our ability to rapidly implement our solutions is principally due to the combination of our emphasis on engagement with the client, our standardized methodology, our cloud-based architecture and our highly configurable, easy-to-use products.
We offer clients the opportunity to utilize on-demand or in-class training designed to provide clients with general knowledge on our solutions. We also host an annual client conference for clients to learn about new products and features and allow clients to provide feedback and learn best practices.
Client Service
Our client service model is designed to serve and support the needs of our clients and to build loyalty by developing strong relationships with clients. We strive to achieve high revenue retention, in part, by delivering high-quality service. Our revenue retention was greater than 92% in each of fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022. Each client is assigned an account management team that serves as the central point of contact for any questions or support needs. We believe this approach enhances client service by providing clients with knowledgeable resources who understand the client’s business, respond quickly, and are accountable for the overall client experience. Account managers are supplemented by teams with deep technical and subject matter expertise who help to expediently and effectively address client needs. We also proactively solicit client feedback through ongoing surveys from which we receive actionable feedback that we use to enhance our client service processes. We have also built an online knowledge repository for clients that provide industry content and Paylocity product and service information.
Tax and Regulatory Services
Our software contains a rules engine designed to make accurate federal, state, and local tax calculations that is continually updated to support all pertinent legislative changes across U.S. jurisdictions with the support of our tax compliance professionals. Our tax service teams provide a variety of solutions to clients including processing payroll tax deposits, preparing and filing quarterly and annual employment tax returns and amendments and resolving client employment tax notices. Our tax filing and compliance departments perform multiple audits to ensure that clients remit timely and accurate tax payments. In addition, a series of audit routines are run to ensure that quarterly tax filings are accurate and submitted on a timely basis. 
Clients
Excluding clients acquired through acquisitions, as of June 30, 2022, we provided our HCM and payroll software solutions to approximately 33,300 clients, across the U.S. The rate at which we add clients is variable period-to-period and is also seasonal as many clients switch solutions during the first calendar quarter of each year. Clients include for-profit and non-profit organizations across industries including business services, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, restaurants, retail, technology and others. For each of the three years ended June 30, 2020, 2021 and 2022, no client accounted for more than 1% of our revenues.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products and services through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographic territories throughout the U.S. We seek to hire experienced sales representatives wherever they are located and believe we have room to grow the number of sales representatives in each of our territories.
The sales cycle begins with a sales lead generated by the sales representative, through our third-party referral network, a client referral, our telemarketing team, our external website, marketing lead generation strategies or other 
territory-based activities. We support our sales force with a marketing program that includes seminars and webinars, email marketing, social media marketing, broker events and web marketing. 
Referral Network
As a core element of our business strategy, we have developed a referral network of third-party service providers, including 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants, that recommend our solutions and provide referrals. Our referral network has become an increasingly important component of our sales process, and in fiscal 2022, more than 25% of our new client revenue originated by referrals from participants in our referral network.
We believe participants in our referral network refer potential clients to us because of the strength of our products and services, the value we provide our referral partners through our broker portal, the fact that we do not provide services that compete with our referral networks, and because we offer third parties the ability to integrate their systems with our platform. Unlike other HCM and payroll solution providers who also provide retirement plans, health insurance and other products and services competitive with the offerings of the participants in our referral network, we focus only on our core business of providing HCM and payroll solutions. In some cases, we have formalized relationships in which we are a recommended vendor of these participants. In other cases, the relationships are informal. We typically do not compensate these participants for referrals.
Partner Ecosystem
We have developed a partner ecosystem of third-party systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems, with whom we provide automated data integration for their clients. These third-party providers require certain financial, payroll and other employee demographic information from their clients to efficiently provide their respective services. After securing authorization from the client, we exchange data with these providers. In turn, these third-party providers supply data to us, which allows us to deliver comprehensive HR and benefit management services to our clients. We believe our partnerships with these third parties are an important part of their service offerings. We have also developed our solutions to integrate with a variety of other systems used by our clients, such as accounting, point of sale, banking, expense management, recruiting, background screening and skills assessment solutions. 
Paylocity’s automated data integration reduces the complexity and risk of error of manual data transfers and saves clients and employees time. Direct and automated data transmission improves the accuracy of data and facilitates data collection in partners’ systems. Having automated data integration with a HCM and payroll provider differentiates partners’ product offerings, strengthening their competitive positioning in their own markets.
Technology
We offer our solutions on a cloud-based platform that leverages a unified architecture and a common code base that we organically developed. Clients do not need to install our software in their data centers and can access our solutions through any mobile device or web browser with Internet access.
•Multi-Tenant Architecture. Our software solutions were designed with a multi-tenant architecture. This architecture gives us an advantage over many disparate traditional systems, which are less flexible and require longer and more costly development and upgrade cycles.
•Mobile Focused. We employ mobile-centric principles in our solution design and development. We believe that the increasing mobility of employees heightens the importance of access to our solutions through mobile devices, including smart phones and tablets. Our mobile experience provides our clients and their employees with access to our solutions through virtually any device having Internet access. We bring the flexibility of a secure, cloud-based solution to users without the need to access a traditional desktop or laptop computer.
•Security. We maintain comprehensive security programs designed to ensure the security and integrity of client and employee data, protect against security threats or data breaches and prevent unauthorized access. We regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at our data centers. Our systems are monitored for irregular or suspicious activity, and we have dedicated internal staff perform security 
assessments for each release. Our systems undergo regular penetration testing and source code reviews by an independent third-party security firm.
We use multiple cloud hosting and third-party data center providers to host our solutions, including data centers in Franklin Park, Illinois and Kenosha, Wisconsin (for backup and disaster recovery). We supply the hardware infrastructure and are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of our equipment at all data center locations.
Competition
The market for HCM and payroll solutions is both fragmented and highly competitive. Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and primarily include payroll and HR service and software providers, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc., Paycom Software, Inc., Paycor, Inc., Ultimate Kronos Group and other local and regional providers.
We believe the principal competitive factors on which we compete in our market include the following:
•Solutions built to connect with today’s modern workforce;
•Comprehensive HCM and payroll product suite on a single platform;
•Breadth and depth of product functionality;
•Configurability and ease of use of our solutions;
•Modern, mobile, intuitive and consumer-oriented user experience;
•Benefits of a cloud-based technology platform;
•Ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly;
•Domain expertise in HCM and payroll;
•Quality of implementation and client service;
•Ease of implementation;
•Real-time web-based payroll processing; and
•Access to a wide variety of complementary third-party service providers.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on the success of our continued investment in sales and marketing, research and development and implementation and client services.
Research and Development
We invest heavily in research and development to continuously introduce new modules, technologies, features and functionality. We are organized in small product-centric teams that utilize an agile development methodology. We focus our efforts on developing new modules and core technologies and on further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing modules.
Research and development costs, including research and development costs that were capitalized, were $91.0 million, $108.5 million and $145.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to 
establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on laws respecting intellectual property rights, including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our modules are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Governmental Regulation
As a provider of HCM and payroll solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, business partners and our employees. Data privacy has become a significant issue for organizations globally, including those in the United States. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Many national, state and local government bodies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations related to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), state breach notification laws, and state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”). Further, because some of our clients have international operations, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other foreign data privacy laws may impact our processing of certain client and employee information.
In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that apply to them. As such, our products and services may become subject to increasing and/or changing regulatory requirements, including changes in tax, benefit and other laws, and as these requirements proliferate, we may be required to change or adapt our products and services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might reduce or eliminate the need for some of our products and services, block us from developing new products and services or have an adverse effect on the functionality and acceptance of our solution. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply, modify or further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new products and services more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate or prevent introduction of such new products and services. For example, the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions or changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed. 
Our ability to comply with and address the continuously evolving requirements and regulations applicable to our business depends on a variety of factors, including the functionality and design of our solutions and the manner in which our clients and their employees utilize them. We have implemented operating policies and procedures to protect the accuracy, privacy and security of our clients’ and their employees’ information and voluntarily undergo certain periodic audits and examinations and maintain certain certifications to demonstrate our commitment to regulatory compliance.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
Human Capital
As a leading provider of cloud-based HCM and payroll software solutions, we are committed to delivering the most modern suite of solutions that drive employee engagement and a more connected culture for both our clients and our employees. Our Co-CEOs, together with our senior executive team and Board of Directors, drive our human capital strategy including key initiatives related to our employees and company culture. 
For additional information regarding our human capital initiatives, we encourage investors and other users of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to visit our Corporate Social Responsibility website at https://www.paylocity.com/who-we-are/about-us/corporate-responsibility/. The information contained on this website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As of June 30, 2022, our workforce consisted of approximately 5,300 employees, substantially all of which were employed on a full-time basis in the United States.
Culture & Engagement
At Paylocity, we strive to be an organization where every employee has a voice, feels welcomed and is empowered to do their best work. Our core values drive our culture – we believe in earning it every day, that growth fuels opportunity, thinking next generation, living the reputation, and being unbeatable together. Our core values serve as the foundation from which we create an engaging culture for our employees, how we train and develop our teams and how we identify the right talent for our organization. Our approach to drive a strong culture and employee engagement has been validated externally as Paylocity has been named Forbes 2022 Best Employers for Diversity, Forbes 2022 America’s Best Mid-Size Employers and was also certified Great Place To Work on multiple occasions.
We support a number of employee resource groups (“ERGs”) including PCTY Equality, which focuses on fostering a positive work environment and providing support for employees and allies of the LGBTQIA+ community, our PCTY OneWorld group, which fosters an inclusive work environment and provides support for our employees of diverse ethnic backgrounds, PCTY Sheroes, which supports and celebrates women, PCTY Sustainability, whereby our employees support initiatives to operate our business and facilities to conserve energy, water and raw materials, and new this year, our PCTY Mental Health, which promotes a psychologically safe and healthy workplace where employees bring their whole selves to work and their mental well-being is supported. Each of these groups are organized to give employees the chance to build community and connections, voice their ideas and perspectives, personally develop and grow, and shape our culture to make a difference at work and in our local communities. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility
Dedication to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (“DEIA”) is foundational to our culture. Led by our Chief Diversity Officer and Diversity Leadership Council, we remain committed to increasing the representation of minority groups within our organization, including in leadership roles, and we directly focus on these goals within our talent acquisition and employee development efforts. Our focus includes attracting diverse candidates to our organization while also investing in professional development and mentorship programs focused on underrepresented employee groups. 
As of June 30, 2022, approximately 51% of our employees identified as female and 36% of our employees were made up of underrepresented minorities. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 44% of director roles and above were held by a female and 28% of our director roles and above were held by underrepresented minorities. The tables below provide metrics regarding the composition of our workforce as of June 30, 2022.

To support our DEIA efforts, we launched a curriculum of learning and training content known as “BRIDGE” (Belonging, Respect, Inclusion, Diversity, Generosity, and Equity), that delivers training content related to topics such as unconscious bias, inclusive leadership and building diverse teams. Our curriculum is designed with the needs of both our employees and clients in mind, with content widely available via our Learning Management System. 
We also strive to cultivate the most inclusive workplace culture possible. To deliver on this commitment, we launched our second annual “Get Counted” self-ID campaign which allows employees to self-identify in areas such as disability, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, veteran status, sexual orientation, and personal pronouns. This data provides an accurate view of our diverse workforce so we can better customize, fund, and initiate specialized programming, accommodations and strategies. 
Learning & Development
As a 2022 Association for Talent Development 100 Best Training organization, we are committed to creating industry leading talent development and leadership programs that support the professional growth of our employees. In addition to other programs throughout our organization, we provide our operations team with an immersive scenario-based training program and our salesforce with an intensive learning experience on our go-to-market sales strategy and process. Through our internally developed Learning Management System (“LMS”) with Video Premium, we enable employees to share knowledge through self-recorded sessions, which complements our library consisting of hundreds of internal courses. We continue to invest in our employees by providing development opportunities through our Leader of Others program, which is designed to help prepare new leaders to guide their team to high performance. This leadership program, combined with our strong culture, increasingly results in our employees stepping into larger roles within the organization evidenced by 53% of new leadership roles being filled internally during fiscal 2022.
Talent Acquisition & Compensation
We focus diligently on attracting a diverse pool of talented candidates that can help us achieve our short and long-term goals as an organization. Our philosophy of “talent anywhere” focuses on identifying the right individuals for our business, regardless of where they are located geographically. For Paylocity, the right talent is someone who embodies our values, has an innate curiosity to learn and grow with our business, and has a diverse perspective on how best to accomplish our goals. We have embraced flexible working arrangements which we believe are essential to enable our employees to work in the environment that best suits their needs.
Our compensation approach is centered around a philosophy that allows us to compete for and retain the right talent to grow our organization, while being consistent and equitable. Our total rewards program includes competitive pay, an employee stock purchase program, the ability to receive a portion of earned wages before the end of the payroll cycle through our On-Demand Payment product, market competitive retirement benefits, paid time off, the ability to consolidate and refinance federal and private student loans, interest free employee loans and many other benefits. Retaining talent is key to our compensation strategy, therefore we have expanded our restricted stock program to cover more than half of our 
employee base. We partner with best-in-class organizations to ensure that we utilize the most current data to serve as a foundation of our compensation strategy.
We are also committed to supporting the health and well-being of our employees and offer a multitude of resources to assist in these efforts. In addition to traditional benefit offerings, we provide all employees with innovative perks and benefits, such as flexible work schedules, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, health advocacy services, paid time off to volunteer, tuition reimbursement and many others. We are also very proud to offer a benefits package that is certified by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.
PCTY Gives
Giving back to our local communities takes many forms at Paylocity. Through PCTY Gives, we mobilize our technology, people and resources across the country through in-kind donations, our Elevate Your Passions (“EYP”) Grant Program, Volunteers in Action paid time-off, signature program funding, corporate sponsored volunteerism and many other initiatives. To support our employees and their communities, each quarter we donate to qualified 501 (c)(3) charities nominated by our employees through the EYP program. In addition to local charities, Paylocity partners with national organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Blessings in a Backpack, American Red Cross, National Alliance on Mental Illness and Illinois Science and Technology Coalition. To support the children of Paylocity employees, the Peter J. McGrail Scholarship program, named after our late CFO, provides higher education tuition assistance for selected participants.
