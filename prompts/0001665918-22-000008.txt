Item 1.    Business
US Foods Holding Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in this Annual Report as “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” or “US Foods.” US Foods Holding Corp. conducts all of its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary US Foods, Inc. (“USF”) and its subsidiaries. 
Our Company
We are among America’s great food companies and leading foodservice distributors. Built through organic growth and acquisitions, we trace our roots back over 150 years to a number of heritage companies with rich legacies in food innovation and customer service. 
We strive to inspire and empower chefs and foodservice operators to bring great food experiences to consumers. This mission is supported by our strategy of GREAT FOOD. MADE EASY.™, which is centered on providing customers with the innovative products business support and technology solutions they need to operate their businesses profitably. We operate as one business with standardized business processes, shared systems infrastructure, and an organizational model that optimizes national scale with local execution, allowing us to manage our business as a single operating segment. We have centralized activities where scale matters and our local field structure focuses on customer facing activities. 
We supply approximately 250,000 customer locations nationwide. These customer locations include independently owned single and multi-unit restaurants, regional restaurant chains, national restaurant chains, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels, country clubs, government and military organizations, colleges and universities, and retail locations. We provide more than 400,000 fresh, frozen, and dry food stock-keeping units, or SKUs, as well as non-food items, sourced from approximately 6,000 suppliers. Approximately 4,000 sales associates manage customer relationships at local, regional, and national levels. Our sales associates are supported by sophisticated marketing and category management capabilities, as well as a sales support team that includes world-class chefs and restaurant operations consultants, new business development managers and others that help us provide more comprehensive service to our customers. Our extensive network of 69 distribution facilities and fleet of approximately 6,500 trucks, along with 80 cash and carry locations, allow us to operate efficiently and provide high levels of customer service. This operating model allows us to leverage our nationwide scale and footprint while executing locally. 
Our Industry
The U.S. foodservice distribution industry has a large number of companies competing in the space, including local, regional, and national foodservice distributors. Foodservice distributors typically fall into three categories, representing differences in customer focus, product offering, and supply chain:
•Broadline distributors which offer a “broad line” of products and services;
•System distributors which carry products specified for large chains; and
•Specialized distributors which primarily focus on specific product categories (e.g., meat or produce) or customer types.
Given our mix of products and services, we are considered a broadline distributor. A number of adjacent competitors also serve the U.S. foodservice distribution industry, including cash-and-carry retailers, commercial wholesale outlets, commercial website outlets, and grocery stores. Customer buying decisions are based on the assortment of product offered, quality, price, and service levels. 
The U.S. foodservice distribution industry serves different customer types of varying sizes, growth profiles, and product and service requirements, including independent restaurants, healthcare customers (such as hospital systems, nursing homes and long-term care facilities), hospitality customers (ranging from large hotel chains to local banquet halls, country clubs, casinos and entertainment complexes), regional and national restaurant chains, colleges and universities, K-12 schools, and retail locations. Our target customer types—independent restaurants, healthcare and hospitality—value foodservice distributors with a broad product offering and value-added services that help them be efficient and effective in running their operations. As described in more detail below, our GREAT FOOD. MADE EASY.™ strategy resonates with these types of customers, and for this reason, we believe our growth prospects with these customers are greater than with other customer types.
In fiscal year 2021, no single customer represented more than 2% of our total customer sales. Sales to our top 50 customers represented approximately 39% of our net sales in fiscal year 2021.
We have entered into contractual relationships with certain group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) that negotiate pricing, delivery and other terms on behalf of their members. In fiscal year 2021, GPO members accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales. GPO members are primarily comprised of customers in the healthcare, hospitality, education, and government/military industries.
There are several important dynamics affecting the industry, including: 
•Evolving consumer tastes and preferences. Consumers demand healthy and authentic food choices with fewer artificial ingredients, and they value locally-harvested and sustainably-manufactured food and packaging products. In addition, many ethnic food offerings are becoming more mainstream as consumers show a greater willingness to try new flavors and cuisines. Changes in consumer preferences create opportunities for new and innovative products and for unique food away from home destinations. This, in turn, is expected to create growth, expand margins, and produce better customer retention opportunities for those distributors with the flexibility to balance national scale and local preferences. We believe foodservice distributors will need broader product assortments, extended supplier networks, effective supply chain management capabilities, and strong food safety and quality programs to meet these needs.
•Generational shifts with millennials and baby boomers. Given their purchasing power and diverse taste profiles, millennials, Generation Z and baby boomers will continue to significantly influence food consumption and the food away from home market. According to recent U.S. Census Bureau statistics, there were 89 million individuals born between 1982 and 2002 in the U.S., making millennials and Generation Z the largest demographic cohorts. When it comes to food, millennials and Generation Z are open-minded and curious, and willing to seek out new flavors, dining experiences and diverse menu offerings, while also demanding customization, convenience and sustainable products. Independent restaurants are well positioned to capitalize on these preferences. As millennials’ and Generation Z’s disposable income increases, we believe this demographic will be key to driving growth in the broader U.S. food industry. We also expect that baby boomers will continue to shape the industry as they remain in the workplace longer, which is expected to prolong their contribution to food away from home expenditures.
•Growing importance of technology. We see significant future growth being driven by the increased utilization of, and reliance on technology by foodservice distributors, customers and diners. E-commerce solutions streamline the purchasing process and increase customer retention. They also deepen the relationship between foodservice distributors and customers, creating personalized insights and services that can make both more efficient. We believe foodservice distributors with deeper, technology-enabled relationships with customers are better able to accelerate their customers’ adoption of new products and increase customer loyalty, giving them a competitive edge. Technology is also growing in importance and helping to level the playing field for independent restaurants. Mobile food delivery and social media apps make independent restaurants more competitive with larger restaurant chains, and help this customer type attract more diners at a relatively low cost. We believe these technology trends will accelerate, as millennials and Generation Z place a greater reliance on technology and become key influencers and decision-makers within the food industry, including at the customer level. Consequently, we believe foodservice distributors which are focused on strengthening their technology, data analytics, and related capabilities will be well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.
We believe that we have the scale, foresight and agility required to proactively address these trends and, in turn, benefit from higher sales growth, greater customer retention, increased private label penetration, and improved profitability. 
Since the World Health Organization characterized a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic in March 2020, the pandemic has impacted our industry as further discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Business Strategy 
Our GREAT FOOD. MADE EASY.™ strategy is built on a differentiation focus in product assortment, customer experience and innovation. Through this strategy, we also serve our customers as consultants and business partners, bringing our customers personalized solutions and tailoring a suite of innovative products and services to fit each customer’s needs. 
The GREAT FOOD portion of our strategy is anchored by leading quality and innovation in produce and center of the plate and other innovative products such as those featured in Scoop™, a program that introduces innovative and on-trend products multiple times a year, helping our customers keep their menus fresh and delivering back-of-house convenience to reduce their labor and food costs. A growing part of our Scoop portfolio is our Serve Good® program. The Serve Good program features more than 500 products that are sustainably-sourced or contribute to waste reduction. Our private brand portfolio is guided by a spirit of innovation and a commitment to delivering superior quality products and value to customers. While we offer products under a spectrum of private brands, and at different price points, all are designed to deliver quality, performance and value to our customers. 
MADE EASY is aimed at providing operators reliability and flexibility in our service model supported by tools and resources to support them in running their businesses. This means on-time and complete orders and customer choice via the multi-channel offering we have to serve our customers. These offerings are supported with technology and expertise that make it easier to transact with us and run their businesses. Our mobile technology platform provides customers with a personalized e-commerce ordering experience and easy-to-use business analytics tools. Our portfolio of value-added services helps customers address key pain points like food 
waste, back-of-house operations and diner traffic. By delivering our products and services through a differentiated team-based selling approach, we provide customers access to a diverse team of experts including chefs, center of the plate and produce specialists and restaurant operations consultants. Approximately 80% of our customers utilize our e-commerce solutions. Customers utilizing these solutions tend to purchase more and have stronger commercial relationships with us.
As noted above, our strategy of making it easier for our customers includes servicing our customers through multiple channels. We have 80 cash and carry locations to provide more customers with a retail option in between deliveries and to cost effectively serve more price-conscious and smaller customers. The cash and carry offering was significantly enhanced by our acquisition in 2020 of Smart Foodservice (as described below). In addition, US Foods Direct™, an online ordering platform, more than doubles our product assortment and provides customers with access to thousands of specialty products which ship directly to them from the supplier. More recently, we expanded our US Foods Pronto™ service in select markets to let restaurant operators receive smaller orders more frequently. All of these channels provide our customers options to shop their way.
We believe our GREAT FOOD. MADE EASY.™ strategy will enable us to reach more customers and create deeper relationships with existing ones, particularly within our target customer types—independent restaurants, healthcare, and hospitality—and drive increased penetration of our private brand products. Further, we believe this strategy positions us to make the most of the continued growth in food away from home consumption and consumer preferences for innovative, on-trend flavors. As an enabler of this strategy, we have invested in embedding continuous improvement in our operations to increase consistency and efficiency and to engage employees in improving our day-to-day processes.
Acquisitions have also historically played an important role in supporting the execution of our growth strategy. In September 2019, we completed the acquisition of five foodservice companies (the “Food Group”) from Services Group of America, Inc.: Food Services of America, Inc., Systems Services of America, Inc., Amerifresh, Inc., Ameristar Meats, Inc. and GAMPAC Express, Inc. for $1.8 billion. The acquisition of the Food Group expanded the Company’s network in the West and Northwest parts of the U.S. On April 24, 2020, USF completed the acquisition of Smart Stores Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Smart Foodservice”), from funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. for $972 million. Smart Foodservice, a company that operated 70 small-format cash and carry stores across California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington that serve small and mid-sized restaurants and other food business customers with a broad assortment of products. 
Integrating the Food Group and Smart Foodservice and realizing synergies from the acquisitions are key priorities for the Company. Following the completion of these acquisitions, we have prioritized deleveraging our balance sheet, however we may selectively pursue acquisition opportunities in the future if they are aligned with and enhance our strategic priorities. 
Products and Brands 
We have a broad assortment of products and brands designed to meet customers’ needs. In many categories, we offer products under a spectrum of private brands based on price and quality covering a range of values and qualities. 
The table below presents the sales mix for our principal product categories for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.

We have registered the trademarks US Foods®, Food Fanatics®, and CHEF’STORE® as part of our overall brand strategy and our retail outlets.

Our U.S. trademarks are effective as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained. We do not have any patents or licenses that are material to our business.
Suppliers
We purchase from approximately 6,000 individual suppliers, none of which accounted for more than 5% of our aggregate purchases in fiscal year 2021. Our suppliers generally are large corporations selling national brand name and private brand products. Additionally, regional and local suppliers support targeted geographic initiatives and private label programs requiring regional and local distribution. 
Seasonality
Our business does not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and, as a result, is not considered seasonal. 
Government Regulation
As a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to various laws and regulations. A summary of some of these laws and regulations is provided below.
Food Handling and Processing
We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the manufacturing, handling, storage, transportation, sale and labeling of food products, including the applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Bioterrorism Act, Food Safety Modernization Act, Federal Meat Inspection Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act, Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, Country of Origin Labeling Act, and regulations issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). 
Our distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by federal and/or state authorities. We have a number of processing facilities for certain meat, poultry, seafood and produce products. These units are registered and inspected by the USDA (with respect to meat and poultry) and the FDA (with respect to produce and seafood) as applicable. 
We also distribute a variety of non-food products, such as food containers, kitchen equipment and cleaning materials, and are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the storage, transportation, distribution, sale and labeling of those non-food products, including requirements to provide information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.
Our customers include several departments of the U.S. federal government, as well as certain state and local governmental entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations that are applicable to government contractors. For example, as a U.S. federal government contractor, we are subject to audit by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
Employment
The U.S. Department of Labor and its agencies, the Employee Benefits Security Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, regulate our employment practices and standards for workers. We are also subject to laws that prohibit discrimination in employment based on non-merit categories, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws relating to accessibility. Our workers’ compensation self-insurance is subject to regulation by the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our facilities are subject to inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act related to our compliance with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace.
Trade
For the purchase of products produced, harvested or manufactured outside of the U.S., and for the shipment of products to customers located outside of the U.S., we are subject to certain reporting requirements and applicable customs laws regarding the import and export of various products. 
Ground Transportation
The U.S. Department of Transportation and its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, regulate our fleet operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service for our drivers. Matters such as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under U.S. federal and state regulations.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to a broad range of U.S. federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as zoning and building regulations. Environmental laws and regulations cover a variety of procedures, including appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; complying with clean air laws, including those governing vehicle emissions; properly handling and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases; and monitoring and maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products.
Anticorruption
Because we are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and our principal place of business is in the U.S., we are considered a “domestic concern” under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and are covered by its anti-bribery provisions.
Human Capital Management 
Employees
As of January 1, 2022, we employed a total of approximately 28,000 associates. Of these: 
•substantially all were employed in the United States and on a full-time basis;
•approximately 70% of our associates were non-exempt, or paid on an hourly basis;
•approximately 5,900 of our associates were members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations; and
•approximately 86% of our associates were working in “field” based roles within our broadline distribution, retail operations and broadline support business production facilities, with the remaining 14% working in shared service or corporate roles.
Collective Bargaining Agreements
As of January 1, 2022, we were party to 51 collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) covering 5,900, or 21%, of our associates working at 29 (or 41%) of our distribution facilities, 4 of our broadline support business production facilities and 23 of our cash and carry locations. During fiscal year 2021, 14 CBAs covering approximately 1,800 union associates were renegotiated. During fiscal year 2022, 13 CBAs covering approximately 1,200 union associates will be subject to renegotiation. While we have experienced work stoppages from time to time in the past, we generally believe we have good relations with both our union and non-union associates, and we strive to be a well-regarded employer in the communities in which we operate.
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to make a positive difference in the lives of our associates. We are committed to compensation and benefits that respect and reward our associates for their dedication and hard work. All of our exempt associates participate in our incentive plans, which provides eligible associates with cash bonus opportunities based upon the Company’s achievement of financial and other key performance metrics. Under our long-term incentive plan, we grant equity compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock units and performance awards, which vest over a period of time, to eligible associates in order to attract and retain key personnel, strengthen their commitment to the welfare of the Company and align their interests with those of our stockholders. Additionally, our comprehensive health and welfare benefits program provides our associates with a variety of medical and dental plans, plus voluntary benefits like vision or critical illness protection. We also offer innovative, no-cost wellness programs, paid time off programs including a paid parental leave policy, an employee assistance program, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) savings plan, and a tuition reimbursement program.
Recruiting, Training and Development
Our ability to attract, develop and retain high-performing associates is crucial to our success, from building trusting relationships with our customers to timely and accurately preparing and delivering orders. In 2021, in response to the challenging job market, we initiated a program to train interested warehouse associates to become commercial driver’s license (“CDL”) Class A delivery drivers. Additionally, through training, mentoring, e-learning and on-the-job development, we help associates at all levels learn and grow, while building a pipeline of diverse talent. Our signature leadership development programs include Gateway to Leadership, Aspire to Grow and Aspire to Lead, which are focused on developing a diverse cohort of leaders in our Company. Our Leadership Foundations program provides training to sales managers, and supervisors and managers in our supply chain organization, and is designed to strengthen leadership capabilities and provide networking opportunities with other leaders across our organization. In addition, we provide training and development programs that enable new associates to be safe and productive including: Sales Readiness, which gives new selling associates tools, resources and peer networking opportunities to help them succeed, and Selector Onboarding, which trains our warehouse selectors on safety, accuracy and performance standards.
Diversity and Inclusion
As a company, we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce and hiring the best talent that reflects the customers and communities we serve. We believe our success relies upon a diverse and dynamic workplace built upon our Cultural Beliefs, which define how we live and create an equitable environment where all our associates can grow and thrive. Our diversity and inclusion strategy consists of three strategic focuses: 
•Creating a more inclusive work environment where everyone feels safe and valued and their voices matter; 
•Increasing the diversity of our workforce and leaders by investing in programs to build a diverse talent pipeline and accelerate the development of diverse associates; and 
•Supporting diverse communities and businesses by enhancing our outreach and sharing who we are and what we stand for. 
We continue to cultivate a culture of inclusion through training programs for our leaders and associates and by sponsoring nine Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”): ADAPT - Ability and Disability Allies Partnering Together; BRIDGE - Black Resource for Inclusion, Diversity, Growth and Empowerment; Collective Asian Network; HOLA - Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Advancement; LINK-UP – Linking Information, Networks and Knowledge; Multigenerational Empowerment Resource Group for Employees; Pride Alliance; Those Who Serve - Military ERG; and Women in Network. These associate-led groups strengthen networking among colleagues and further personal and professional development. Ongoing listening sessions between the ERGs and our executive leadership team allow for open dialogue and the identification of new opportunities to bolster our diversity and inclusion strategy and strengthen associate engagement. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to continuously driving an enhanced safety culture built on education, awareness and associate engagement. Our Get Home Safe campaign, directed at drivers and operations personnel, outlines actions aimed at reducing risks and improving safety routines. In our facilities, our safety performance teams receive annual training and are focused on improving safety engagement and performance throughout our operations. Our Driver Safety Program has been implemented across all markets to train our drivers on transportation safety. We utilize technology to improve driver safety from distracted driver alerts to collision mitigation technology.
During fiscal years 2020 and 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented, and continue to maintain, protocols and enhanced safety measures to protect the health and safety of our associates and customers. During 2021, we partnered with third-party providers to host more than 90 on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics for associates and their family members, supporting thousands of associates in becoming vaccinated. We continue to proactively monitor guidance and requirements from the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), OSHA and various other federal, state and local authorities and public health agencies and adjust our protocols and safety measures as appropriate to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our associates and customers.
