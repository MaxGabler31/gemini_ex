We serve as a one-stop shop, providing scientists all they need to conduct their research: materials & consumables, equipment & instrumentation and services & specialty procurement. Our customer-centric innovation model enables us to provide solutions for some of the most demanding applications, and we leverage our comprehensive offering and access to early-stage research to seek content and solutions that ultimately become specified into our customers’ approved production platforms. Our broad portfolio of products and services, fully integrated business model and world class supply chain enable us to support our customers’ journey every step of the way.
We have a number of distinctive capabilities that set Avantor apart from other companies in our space. For example, our global footprint offers extraordinary customer access, enabling us to serve more than 225,000 customer locations in more than 180 countries around the world. 
Our 117-year legacy began in 1904 with the founding of the J.T. Baker Chemical Company. In 2010, we were acquired by New Mountain Capital from Covidien plc. Since then, we have expanded through a series of large acquisitions across the globe.

Suppliers
We sell proprietary products we make and third-party products sourced from a wide variety of product suppliers located across the globe. Our supplier relationships are based on contracts that vary in geographic scope, duration, product and service type, and some include exclusivity provisions. Those relationships may include distribution, sales and marketing support as well as servicing of instruments and equipment. Many of our supplier relationships have been in place for more than twenty years.
Sales channels
We reach our customers throughout the Americas, Europe and AMEA via a well-trained global sales force, comprehensive websites and targeted catalogs. Our sales force is comprised of approximately 3,700 sales and sales support professionals, including over 180 sales specialists selected for their in-depth industry and product knowledge. Our sales professionals include native speakers for each of the countries in which we operate, allowing us to have high impact interactions with our customers across the globe.
Our e-commerce platform plays a vital role in how we conduct business with our customers. In 2021, approximately 73% of our transactions came from our digital channels. Our websites utilize search analytics and feature personalized search tools, customer specific web solutions and enhanced data that optimize our customers’ online purchasing experience and better integrate our customers’ processes with our own. Our websites are designed to integrate acquisitions, drive geographical expansion and serve segmented market needs with ease.

We rely on our scale, expertise, deep customer access, depth of product and value-added service offerings, marketing strategies and sales force, acquisition strategy, financial profile and management team to deliver superior solutions to our customers and provide extensive market channel access to our suppliers.
Sustainability
Our responsibility to improve the world through science is not one that we take lightly. We are committed to measurable sustainability actions that will create a positive impact on the environment and society. Our Science for Goodness sustainability platform enhances our framework for creating long-term value by embedding sound environmental, social and governance practices into our business strategy. The platform also enables us to continually measure and report progress against four key commitment pillars. We have aligned our pillars with several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals where we believe we can have a positive impact for our business and stakeholders.
By providing sustainable products and services as well as transparent information and reporting, we also strive to support our customers in achieving their sustainability goals. Our sustainability is reflected in our people, the products we create, the transformative services we provide, and the integrity with which we serve our shareholders, business partners, suppliers, customers, and communities. We are deeply committed to our global sustainability efforts and keenly aware of the work ahead of us in this area.
Employees and human capital resources
Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and diverse talent. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,500 employees located in over 30 different countries in a variety of roles. Approximately 5,850 of our associates were employed in the United States, and the remainder were employed outside of the United States. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 6% of our employees in North America were represented by unions, and a majority of our employees in Europe were represented by workers’ councils or unions. We compete in the highly competitive life sciences industry. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in technical, marketing, sales, research and other positions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on a number of factors, including a positive work environment and culture, compensation and benefits, talent development and career growth and opportunities, and protecting the health, safety and well-being of our associates. To that end, we invest in our associates in order to be an employer of choice with limitless opportunity.
Avantor 2021 Workforce 
Our associates reflect the communities in which we live and work, the customers we serve, and possess a broad range of thought and experiences that have helped Avantor achieve our goal of setting science in motion to create a better world. 
People & culture
Our values give our associates a foundation for how we want to work together. Innovation, Customer-centricity, Accountability, Respect, and Excellence are the building blocks of our company culture and send a strong message to our associates, customers, suppliers, stockholders and communities: ICARE. In addition, our executive leaders serve as sponsors of our associate-centric teams (ACTs) in support of our diversity and inclusion initiatives. ACTs are employee resource groups that bring associates together and foster inclusion based on common interests, backgrounds and characteristics. 
Compensation and benefits
We are committed to rewarding, supporting and developing the associates who make it possible to deliver on our strategy. To that end, we offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at the varying health, home-life and financial needs of our diverse and global associates. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, an employee stock purchase plan, paid time off and family leave, flexible work schedules, access to wellness programs, free physicals and flu vaccinations, and an Employee Assistance Program and other mental health services.
Growth and development
We invest significant resources to develop talent with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our strategy. We offer associates and their managers a number of tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities. These programs are underpinned by the Avantor Business System, which drives excellence in people, processes and problem solving. These consistent lean leadership practices empower associates to continuously improve and add value to our operations and customer solutions. We have aligned our performance management system through which 100% of our associates receive annual performance reviews, to support our culture of feedback to increase the focus on continuous learning and development.
Health, safety and well-being
We are committed to protecting the health, safety and well-being of our associates. Our approach involves environment, health and safety professionals and process engineers who identify risks and implement behavioral solutions to prevent accidents before they occur. A robust auditing program is in place at every facility to ensure that we measure performance and drive continuous improvement. Our core areas of focus include compliance with regulatory and international requirements, active monitoring of regulatory agencies for changing requirements, partnering with operational leaders to meet Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) requirements, and promoting effective communication throughout the organization.
Impact of COVID-19
The evolving COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management in 2021, and we continued to be vigilant in our response by following precautionary safety guidance from credible health agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). A majority of our workforce worked remotely during some portion of the year. In our facilities where essential workers continued to work on-site, we continued or enhanced safety protocols and procedures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In addition, we offered associates a number of expanded benefits, including 
providing up to 10 additional days of paid time off if required to quarantine or otherwise experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, expanding access to no cost individual counseling sessions and virtual support groups under our employee assistance programs, hosting virtual wellness events and waiving telemedicine co-pays for all visits in 2021. Despite the effects of the pandemic, the size of our workforce remained steady in 2021 and we were able to avert employee layoffs related to the pandemic.
Intellectual property
We rely on intellectual property rights, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our offerings, services and intangible assets. Much of our intellectual property is know-how and asset configurations that we treat as trade secrets. These proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations. In some instances, we may license our technology to third parties or may elect to license intellectual property from others. We have applied in the United States and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks, service marks and patents, some of which have been registered and issued. We also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks. Other than our Avantor, VWR, J.T.Baker, NuSil and Masterflex trademarks, we do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession to be material to our overall business.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal, but some of our proprietary products have exhibited cyclical customer demand in prior periods. We believe that this is caused by factors unique to those particular product markets such as customer manufacturing schedules, inventory levels in the supply chain and government approval processes. As a result, we may see fluctuations across periods as the timing of our customers’ demand for these products may change.
Government contracts 
We conduct business with various government agencies and government contractors. As such, we are subject to certain laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business with the government, as well as with those concerning government contracts. Failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, and no government contract is of such a magnitude as to have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Government regulation
Our facilities that engage in the manufacturing, packaging, distribution and other biopharmaceutical and biomaterials product lines, as well as many of our products themselves, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by U.S. governmental authorities, the EMA and other global regulatory authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to register with these agencies, or to apply for permits and/or licenses with, and must comply with the operating, cGMP, quality and security standards of applicable domestic and foreign regulators, including the FDA, the DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, DHHS, the equivalent agencies of European Union member states, and comparable foreign, state and local agencies, as well as various accrediting bodies, each depending upon the type of operation and the locations of storage or sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries in the event of noncompliance.
In order to maintain certain certifications of quality and safety standards for our manufacturing facilities and operations, we must comply with numerous regulatory systems, standards, guidance and other requirements, as appropriate, including, but not limited to, ICH Q7, the guidelines of the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council, European in vitro diagnostic medical device directives, United States Pharmacopeia / National Formulary, as well as the European, British, Japanese, Indian and Chinese Pharmacopeia, the Food Chemicals Codex and controlled substances regulations.
In addition, our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products. We are subject to various federal, state, local, foreign and transnational laws, regulations and recommendations, both in the United States and abroad, relating to safe working conditions, good laboratory and distribution practices, and the safe and proper use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, U.S. and international import and export laws and regulations, including those enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury, OFAC and BIS, require us to abide by certain standards relating to the cross-border transit of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of related information. Our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, and the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. We are also subject to various other laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws as well as laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records.
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal, state, local, foreign and transnational regulations could be significant, and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1A, “Risk factors—Risks related to regulation.” We are subject to audits by the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies. To date, we have had no instances of noncompliance that have had a material impact on our operations.
In addition to the regulations described above, as part of our aerospace and military offerings, we are registered with the DDTC as a manufacturer and exporter of goods controlled by ITAR, and we are subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements related to these goods. In connection with our NuSil brand products, we have one ITAR site registration and one ITAR product registration, and we maintain control systems which enable ITAR compliance. With respect to our electronics materials products, we adhere to applicable industry guidelines which set stringent quality criteria for our products, and we are subject to import and export regulations and other restrictions regarding the safe use of these products as well.
Environmental matters
We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental, safety and health matters, including employee safety and health, in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and CERCLA. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and the general health and safety of our associates and the communities in which we operate. We are also subject to regulation by OSHA concerning employee safety and health matters. The 
EPA, OSHA, and other federal and foreign or local agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations.
Under CERCLA, and analogous statutes in local and foreign jurisdictions, current and former owners and operators of contaminated land are strictly liable for the investigation and remediation of the land and for natural resource damages that may result from releases of hazardous substances at or from the property. Liability under CERCLA and analogous laws is strict, unlimited, joint, several, retroactive, may be imposed regardless of fault and may relate to historical activities or contamination not caused by the current owner or operator. It is possible that facilities that we acquire or have acquired may expose us to environmental liabilities associated with historical site conditions that have not yet been discovered.
In addition to the federal environmental laws that govern our operations, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
A number of our operations involve, in varying degrees, the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. For additional information about environmental matters, see note 13 to our audited financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this report.
