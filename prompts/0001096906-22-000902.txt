Historical Business Operations

We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010, under the name AXIM International, Inc. On July 24, 2014, we changed our name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. 

                The Company’s historical business operations focused on the research, development and production of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products based upon our proprietary technologies. This business and its related intellectual property were divested by the Company in May 2020. 

In March 2020, we acquired Sapphire Biotech, Inc. (“Sapphire”), a diagnostic healthcare solutions company, changing our business operations.

Acquisition of Sapphire Biotech, Inc.

On March 17, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sapphire and all of its stockholders, pursuant to which, upon closing of the transaction, we: (i) acquired 100% of Sapphire’s outstanding capital, consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock; and (ii) assumed all of the outstanding debt of Sapphire. The outstanding debt included two convertible notes in the principal amounts of $310,000 and $190,000, respectfully.

In exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sapphire, we issued an aggregate of 54,000,000 newly issued shares of Company common stock to Sapphire’s existing stockholders (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Sapphire became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which has resulted in consolidated financial reporting by the Company to include the results of Sapphire. 

 Acquisition of Advanced Tear Diagnostics, LLC technology

On August 26, 2021, we purchased certain eye disease diagnostic technology from Advanced Tear Diagnostics, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (“Advanced Tear”), consisting of a 510(K) license for Lactoferrin, a biomarker for dry eye disease and a 510(K) license for IgE, a biomarker for allergic ocular reaction (collectively, the “510(K) Licenses”). The purchase price for the 510(K) Licenses was $4,270,000, which price was paid by issuing 7,000,000 restricted shares of Company common stock to Advanced Tear.

Also on August 26, 2021, we purchased five patents (the “Patents”) from Advanced Tear for $250,000 (which includes assuming and paying $30,000 of the Advanced Tear liabilities). The bulk of the purchase price ($210,000) was in a note that requires seven equal monthly payments of $30,000, which payment started on September 3, 2021. The note has since been repaid in full.

Current Operations Following Acquisition of Sapphire and Advanced Tear’s Assets

COVID-19

As Sapphire had been a pioneer in the research and development of diagnostic tools for the early screening of cancer cells, our researchers were able to quickly adapt our existing research and technology to create diagnostic tools that screen for COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies. The current need for such an instrument is great, as the pandemic continues to plague the worldwide healthcare landscape.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has spread at an alarming rate since the first cases were identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. The virus can be transmitted from person-to-person in respiratory secretions from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Since the virus was new to the human population and death rates are 10 to 50-fold higher than other respiratory viruses, the pandemic has placed excessive demands on the global healthcare network. Because initially there were no vaccines or effective antiviral therapies that existed for SARS-CoV-2, efforts to combat this pandemic have been challenging.

Polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) tests that detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection are playing an important role in tracking disease spread, while serological tests that detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are now being used to measure past rates of infection and identify individuals that could be immune to COVID-19. However, not all antibodies are created equal and tests that specifically measure antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 have not been generally available to healthcare providers or patients.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies block binding and entry of the virus into host cells. It is desirable to have high levels of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma used to treat patients fighting COVID-19 so that those antibodies can block the virus from further infecting the host. However, despite convalescing from the disease, not all individuals make high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, there is a clinical need to measure levels of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

The most widely used antibody tests on the market today do not specifically identify neutralizing antibodies. Instead, they measure a large family of antibodies that bind to various parts of the virus, but that do not necessarily neutralize it. To address this shortcoming, we developed a patent-pending rapid diagnostic test, which is specifically focused on measuring the levels of functional neutralizing antibodies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 from attaching to human cells. The test is based on blocking the interaction between human cell receptors and the viral spike protein that mimics the virus neutralization process in the body.

Why A Neutralizing Antibody Test

Our test is a rapid (10-minute) serological diagnostic test that measures SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, or Nabs. Our SARS-Cov-2 Neutralizing Antibody (“Nab”) Rapid Test is the first of its kind, and is a rapid lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay intended for the semi-quantitative measurement of neutralizing antibody in human serum or plasma (sodium heparin, potassium and acid dextrose citrate) or fully quantitative with the use of an electronic reader. The test SARS-Cov-2 Neutralizing Antibody Rapid Test measures Nabs within 10 minutes, unlike traditional tests, which require days. Our test kit does not utilize live biological materials and does not require the strict biosafety protocol associated with live virus samples.

Specifically, we envision that our test may be used for the following:


(i) | Measurement of neutralizing antibodies in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and/or received a vaccine and to provide an “Immunity Passport” so that they can go back to work and school or participate in social gatherings without risk of infecting others. The primary goal of any vaccine is to induce neutralizing antibody responses that protect vaccine recipients from infection and subsequent disease. As COVID-19 vaccines have been rolling out to the general public, we believe immunity monitoring is starting to play a critical role in determining whether the vaccine is effective, for how long, and when it is time for recipients of the vaccine to get a booster shot. Since immunity to the virus is not anticipated to last forever, the immunity monitoring could continue for many years, even after widespread vaccination throughout the world.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Additionally, we believe that measuring neutralizing antibodies in vaccine recipients after vaccination may provide greater insight into how vaccine responses hold up over time. That way, when levels of neutralizing antibodies eventually decrease, vaccine recipients will have a sense of when their neutralizing antibodies are unacceptably low and a revaccination is necessary to continue their protection from COVID-19. 
(ii) | Screening plasma collected from individuals recovered from COVID-19 so that patients fighting COVID-19 can be treated with plasma containing high levels of Nabs. Additionally, Nabs need to be monitored in patients receiving convalescent plasma so that we learn what is an effective therapeutic dose.

Our test is different from neutralizing antibody tests currently available because:


· | It specifically tests for neutralizing antibodies, which are those needed to fight COVID-19 within the body;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | It can quantitatively measure the amount of neutralizing antibodies a person has; 
· | Patients get their results in just a few minutes; and 
· | It is portable. 


In preclinical research, our test has already been proven to work with 97.8% accurately in plasma and serum and can easily be modified to work on any specific strains of COVID-19; accordingly, we believe that newly-discovered strains will not affect its efficacy. Our test has shown a significantly better statistical correlation with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays than the currently available antibody tests. Since the rapid test lends well to conducting live virus-based assays, we believe that it could serve as an effective low-cost alternative to lab-based assays for monitoring large numbers of vaccine recipients for neutralizing antibodies.

As our scientific team was hard at work developing our COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests we were frustrated by the delays and costs caused by lack of supply of a recombinant virus binding protein (“VBP”) for SARS-CoV-2 were essential to our testing. To continue our projects as planned and decrease overall costs, we decided to make our own VBP, which is even more potent than current outsourced options. Our laboratory tests have proven that SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (“RBD”) spike protein binds with our novel VBP. Initial tests also show that our novel VBP is approximately ten times more potent and stable than other VBP options currently on the market. We now develop these core ingredients needed to manufacture test strips in-house, and believe that moving such production in-house provides us with the potential to derive additional revenue and also allows us to control our supply chain. We have already manufactured enough VBP for millions of rapid diagnostic tests.

In August 2020, we signed an exclusive licensing, manufacturing and distribution agreement with Empowered Diagnostics, LLC (“Empowered”) to execute the high-volume production of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic test. Together with Empowered, we completed the technology transfer, and Empowered built out their production facility to enable them to manufacture millions of our tests per month. The test was used to complete two human point-of-care clinical trials, and Empowered Diagnostics filed for FDA emergency use approval (“EUA”) of the device on March 24, 2021. 

On January 28, 2022, the FDA notified Empowered that it was issuing a Class One recall for the test together with Empowered’s antigen test for mislabeling. The FDA also notified Empowered that it would no longer consider EUA’s unless they were fully quantitative and because the test Empowered had filed the EUA for was semi-quantitative it would be denied. As per our agreement, we notified Empowered on February 10, 2022 that we were giving a 30-day cure notice as per the agreement or we would be terminating the agreement. On March 4, 2022, the two companies entered into a separation agreement.

On March 6, 2022, we announced that while the Company explores filing one or more EUA’s for point of care and/or at home use, we would begin to offer the test For Research Use Only (“RUO”), as it does not require FDA approval. 

The test can facilitate research in a variety of areas related to COVID-19, including, diagnostic test development, vaccine and therapeutic development, studies related to immunity and adaptive immune response, and epidemiological research into the control of the virus. The Nab test will allow researchers to assess the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and compare effectiveness of naturally acquired vaccine-induced antibody response. 

The Company is making two tests available for RUO, including the quantitative measurement of neutralizing antibodies using a reader, which will provide the exact number detected, and a semi-quantitative test for the measurement of neutralizing antibodies, which will identify high, medium, and low neutralization titers.

Notwithstanding ongoing monitoring of immune responses, there is an urgent need to fully understand the efficacy of vaccines and to identify what are the correlates of protection. Offering our Nab tests for RUO may help support vaccine efficacy evaluation and herd immunity assessments. In fact, our partner and co-inventor of the test, Dr. Douglas Lake, has already tested hundreds of ASU students and faculty with our Nab test. Dr. Lake has an ongoing correlative study to measure exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus at different points in time by measuring and tracking the Nab levels before and after receiving vaccines, and before and after contracting the virus. Dr. Lake and the AXIM team have published numerous tentative reports regarding the correlation between vaccine immunity and natural immunity. Dr. Lake will continue his studies over the course of a year with the objective of determining definitive correlates of protection.

About Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)

The Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) authority allows FDA to help strengthen the nation’s public health protections against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats including infectious diseases, by facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures needed during public health emergencies.

Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declares that an emergency use authorization is appropriate, FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when certain criteria are met, including there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The HHS declaration to support such use must be based on one of four types of determinations of threats or potential threats by the Secretary of HHS, Homeland Security, or Defense.

On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes COVID-19.

COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices

In vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) devices are tests performed on samples taken from the human body, such as swabs of mucus from inside the nose or back of the throat, or blood taken from a vein or fingerstick. IVDs can detect diseases or other conditions and can be used to monitor a person’s overall health to help cure, treat, or prevent diseases.

There are several types of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 related IVDs:


· | Diagnostic Tests: Tests that detect parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can be used to diagnose infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These include molecular tests and antigen tests. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Serology/Antibody and Other Adaptive Immune Response Tests: Tests that detect antibodies (for example, IgM, IgG) to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or that measure a different adaptive immune response (such as, T cell immune response) to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These types of tests cannot be used to diagnose a current infection. 
· | Tests for Management of COVID-19 Patients: Beyond tests that diagnose or detect SARS-CoV-2 virus or antibodies, there are also tests that are authorized for use in the management of patients with COVID-19, such as to detect biomarkers related to inflammation. Once patients are diagnosed with COVID-19 disease, these additional tests can be used to inform patient management decisions.


On September 16, 2020, we filed an EUA application with the FDA for measuring COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in plasma and serum through our first-in-class rapid diagnostic test. We amended the EUA to include positive results from a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) live virus test that positively correlates the rapid 10-minute lateral flow assay test that accurately detects and measures levels of functional COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in plasma which the FDA demanded. 

On March 24, 2020, our manufacturing partner at the time, Empowered Diagnostics, filed an EUA application with the FDA for measuring COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in whole blood for a Point-of-Care application of our rapid diagnostic test. On November 15, 2021, the FDA announced that it was changing its guidelines for neutralizing antibodies tests and would only accept applications for fully quantitative tests. In January 2022, the FDA informed Empowered it would not approve the EUA. While the Company contemplates filing a new EUA, we have announced that we will begin sale of the test for Research Only Use.

Our COVID-19 related product candidates, including our lateral flow diagnostic test for measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, are subject to uncertainties relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization, and further risks based on the constantly evolving situation affecting the United States and the international community. Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, there is no assurance that these candidates would generate revenues or that any revenues generated would be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the FDA is over-run with EUA applications from thousands of biotech and pharmaceutical companies and could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Eye Health

On August 26, 2021, we acquired the intellectual property and the exclusive global rights to market two FDA approved lateral flow assays which utilize a non-invasive, quantitative, point of care human tear test to aid in the diagnosis and selection of therapeutics for the treatment of eye diseases. 

Currently, we have FDA 510k approval to test Lactoferrin (aqueous deficiency biomarker) and IgE (non-specific allergy biomarker). Our objective is to establish point of care testing for dry eye disease (“DED”) and to establish this modality as the new standard of care. The tests are quick, simple to use, and inexpensive to the clinic. The tests are CMS and private insurance reimbursable.

While at one time the tests were sold in numerous eye doctors locations, when the Company acquired the assays they had been mothballed and the Company had to redevelop the tests, reagents and select a quantitative reader. Since the acquisition of the technology, the Company has been successful in redevelopment and is preparing to launch sales.

We have signed a supply agreement with Barcelona-based IUL SA (“IUL”) for our iPeak DED readers, which will be deployed for diagnostic testing with a focus on lactoferrin and IgE levels. This state-of-the-art portable reader is a colorimetric lateral flow reader designed to hold different cassette sizes and can read cassettes of up to five strips and seven lines per strip at a time.

iPeak is equipped with “Flash Eye” technology based on the principles of machine vision illumination. Its camera captures the image of the test illuminated from LED lights situated in the most studied geometry to achieve a precise and uniform illumination and enhance the colors of any lateral flow test. The iPeak technology also allows for more sensitivity, which is the main success of its application.

We evaluated the iPeak readers in the lab against six other comparable products before deciding on IUL’s state-of-the-art products. The new readers will be calibrated with the new test strips and distributed to our Medical Advisory Board (“MAB”) of renowned DED experts for non-clinical field testing on their patients, which includes studying the accuracy and ease of use. These tests are expected to run for a few weeks and the MAB will provide management with data and feedback regarding the test results and any other research findings.

The Company’s diagnostic testing process for DED, and specifically for lactoferrin levels as a primary indicator, will include the use of reagent strip samples. These strips will have the patients’ tear sample obtained and applied and then an ophthalmologist or optometrist will run the strips through an reader to determine lactoferrin levels and incidence and severity of DED.

Our tests are considered moderately complex by CLIA. This requires the user of the test to obtain a CLIA certificate of compliance. This is done by filing a simple application with CMS. (Form 116). We will assist in the filing to provide an effortless process for the customer. Additionally, we are pursuing a waiver for current and future product offerings and intend to file for the waiver in the second or third quarter of 2022.

To manage and navigate the CLIA compliance, readers, lab testing and field-testing process, we have retained veteran laboratory testing executive Barry Craig as a consultant. In this role, he will manage the Company’s DED lab testing initiative. He has more than 25 years of experience in the clinical laboratory as a Generalist, QA Coordinator, and Microbiology Supervisor. He also served as Lab Coordinator for the Children’s Hospital of Alabama for 12 years. Craig has deep-seated experience in regulatory compliance as the owner of Laboratory Consulting, LLC, and has served as the Regulatory Compliance Consultant for CLIA, the Commission on Office Laboratory Accreditation (“COLA”), and the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”). He has successfully established more than 200 moderate and high complexity laboratories, and is a contributor for several trade publications such as MLO magazine, ADVANCE for Administrators of the Laboratory Magazine, and Physician Office Resource Magazine.

We believe that the acquisition of these FDA 510k approved diagnostic products, along with proven management practices and capital, will allow the business to grow at a rapid pace. Low levels of Lactoferrin confirm inadequate glandular tear production (aqueous deficiency) and high levels of IgE indicate an active ocular allergy. If both biomarkers are normal, the cause of a patient’s dry eye condition could be attributed to evaporative dry eye. So, by performing these two tests, an eye doctor may now precisely know the underlying cause of the tear film disorder, its severity and the appropriate treatment protocol to pursue. In addition, these tests are rapid, accurate, reimbursable, profitable and can be performed by a technician, which allows the physician to be more productive and attend to more patients. 

Dye Eye Market

An estimated 16 million Americans have been diagnosed with DED, but the actual number of Americans suffering from dry eye symptoms is likely much higher. Some reports indicate that nearly half of all U.S. adults experience dry eye signs and symptoms, and 33% of patients in eye care clinics present with complaints about dry eye.

DED, though widespread, is under-diagnosed, in part because symptoms do not always correlate with objective signs. It has a highly variable symptom profile at different stages of the disease, and there is often a discordance between signs and symptoms. A patient can have severe symptoms yet show no sign of ocular surface damage, while others have advanced ocular surface damage, yet report no symptoms. This lack of correlation between clinical signs and symptoms of DED makes diagnosing and treating patients a challenge. Often times, inflammation is present before the clinical signs of DED. 

Currently, our eye business focuses exclusively on ophthalmology and optometry, in the United States, where there are 37,000 optometrists and 19,000 ophthalmologists performing approximately 400,000 medical (dilated) eye exams per day. Of this total, we believe that approximately 20% to 30% would present with symptoms where ATD’s Lactoferrin & IgE tests would be indicated. It is estimated that total US market for our eye care systems could approach 50,000 systems. (USA Only)

We have completed development of our immunoassay system, which includes an automated colorimetric photometer reader and two FDA market cleared point-of-care (POC) quantitative diagnostic ophthalmic lab tests. These are: 

Ocular Lactoferrin CPT code 83520 2021 CMS reimbursement $17.27/eye *

Ocular Immunoglobulin E CPT Code 83520 2021 CMS reimbursement $16.46/eye*

Studies indicate that in 2021, 16-49 million Americans had DED, representing 32 - 98 million potential use cases for our POC tests. These tests are not limited to DED diagnostics, but can also be used to determine the Lf and allergic components of tear film prior to:


· | Contact lens fitting – approximately 45 million people wear contact lens in the US alone (2021).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | LASIK surgery- approximately 718,000 (2020). 
· | Cataract surgery with lens exchange - approximately 3.8 million (2018). 


The barrier for entrance into the dry eye space is difficult and requires extensive clinical studies, large capital expense and FDA 510k approval. This process alone can take several years and substantial investment, with no certainty that the product will receive FDA 510k approval. 

Business Model 

Our eye business model will utilize a razor/razor blade model. The two sources of revenue: (1) the sale of readers and (2) sale of disposable tests. It is anticiapted.that 95+% of gross profits will be generated from the sale of tests. We have not determined the list price of the readers. Discounts will be offered to purchasing groups, corporate accounts, academic institutions engaged in research or training, and others as deemed appropriate. It is anticipated that the average price for the reader will be slightly above our acquisition costs, while pricing of consumable diagnostic kits will be at roughly half of the CMS published reimbursement floor rate. Current pricing is $2,100 for 100 bilateral test cassettes (200 tests) and provides a margin of approximately 65 - 72%. 

Market demand for the system is expected to be moderate to begin with until we become a preferred vendor with a large purchasing group or until we are granted a waiver from CLIA.. At that time we expect high demand for our system. We also expect high demand for our recently developed MMP-9 quantitative test once we get FDA approval. While we must compete with other capital equipment expenditures under consideration in any ophthalmic physician’s office, we believe that no other ophthalmic device offers the combination of compelling clinical and financial benefits afforded by our system. The clinical utility of the tests offers important diagnostic precision, differentiation and treatment management direction. Inner-office efficiencies significantly improve the patient flow characteristics, reducing patients in office visit time and greatly reducing physicians chair time with each patient. 

Financially, for every patient per day tested the physician will receive, on average, $2 in reimbursement for every $1 expended on supplies. 

                CMS and private insurance allow for physicians to retest their patients as often as deemed medically necessary. The average retesting rate for Lactoferrin is 65% ,while the IgE retesting rate is 35%.

Dye Eye Disease Competition 

Currently there are five FDA approved tests for DED:


Biomarker | Company | Type | CLIA status 
------------------+---------+-------------------------+--------------------
Lactoferrin | Axim | (quantitative analysis) | moderate complexity
IgE | Axim | (quantitative analysis) | moderate complexity
MMP9 | Quidel | (qualitative only) | waived 
Osmolarity | TearLab | (quantitative analysis) | waived 
Ocular Adenovirus | Quidel. | (qualitative only) | waived 


The preferred clinical analysis is quantitative, giving us an advantage over the competition. Since our reader can interpret many different analytes other than Lf and IgE, it also opens the possibility of additional quantitative test development.

New Quantitative MMP-9 Test

On March 8, 2022, we announced that we had successfully developed what we believe to be the first-ever rapid quantitative tear test for MMP-9, an inflammatory biomarker for DED. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an inflammatory biomarker consistently elevated in the tears of dry eye patients, may accelerate early diagnosis when detected. 

The central role of inflammation in OSD is widely recognized, but our ability to measure this in the clinic has been limited to the Quidel InflammaDry test, which measures tear matrix MMP-9 levels and provides a positive/negative result around a threshold of 40ng/ml of MMP-9. This “yes or no” report has clinical value, but it is limited. Currently available MMP-9 testing does not detect a reduction in tear MMP-9 levels until the concentration drops below 40ng/ml and thus may miss clinically significant improvement that did not reach that threshold.

The clinical benefits of our quantitative tear MMP-9 testing would be a significant advance in the ability to measure the degree of inflammation affecting dry eye patients, allowing for more objective classification of their disease. Equally important would be the ability to measure improvement in control of inflammation that is the goal of many of our therapies for OSD, including pharmaceuticals, thermal pulsation treatments and even light based therapies. 

We are also in the process of developing additional bio-marker tests that will be done on the existing platform, without the constant need of the clinician to upgrade to a newer platform. The Lateral Flow test reader is software driven and can be programmed to interpret other biomarkers as they are clinically studied and FDA approved. The test uses 0.5 microliters of human tear fluid, that is applied to a disposable lateral flow cassette (one cassette per patient tested). The disposable single use cassette generates a substantial, reoccurring revenue stream for our eye business and our stakeholders.

Oncology

We acquired Sapphire in order to develop and commercialize a unique therapeutic approach designed to disrupt cancer growth and block metastatic spread. Prior to our acquisition of Sapphire, it acquired an exclusive license to the technology around SBI-183, an anti-metastatic compound developed by Dr. Douglas Lake at Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University to inhibit QSOX1. Dr. Douglas Lake is a co-founder of Sapphire. 
Oncology Strategy

We continue to advance our mission of improving global cancer care through the development of novel therapeutics for controlling metastatic cancer spread, and diagnostics for early cancer detection, response to treatment, and for monitoring post-treatment recurrence. We aspire to be the leader in QSOX1-targeted metastatic cancer therapies, and have undertaken the development of a potent QSOX1 inhibitor to be used as a platform drug for a variety of indications.

We have been investigating the enzyme Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1 (“QSOX1”), a master regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling, and its overexpression by tumor cells. QSOX1 is a tumor-derived enzyme that is important for cancer growth, invasion and metastasis. Overexpression of QSOX1 has been unambiguously linked to promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. One of the Company’s co-founders, Dr. Douglas Lake, has discovered that a small molecule SBI-183 inhibited the enzymatic activity of QSOX1, and as a result, suppressed tumor cell invasion in vitro and metastasis of breast tumor cells in vivo. Through our medicinal chemistry efforts, we synthesized multiple structural analogs of SBI-183 and unveiled SPX-1009 as a lead compound that demonstrated ten-fold improvement in suppressing invasion and metastasis in several cancer models.

Through our medicinal chemistry efforts, we have synthesized multiple structural analogs of SBI-183, and we unveiled SPX-1009 as a lead compound that demonstrated ten-fold improvement in suppressing invasion and metastasis in several cancer models. 

We believe that our therapeutic drug development strategy targeting the metastatic spread is a unique, novel and pioneering approach to saving lives. Our near-term objective is to demonstrate the ability of our lead anti-QSOX1 drug candidates to suppress tumor growth and metastasis and to advance them into pre-clinical studies.

We believe that Sapphire is the first to discover the over-expression of QSOX1 as a biomarker for cancer in blood. We have filed a patent application claiming many discoveries related to QSOX1, including a rapid diagnostic test, which we have developed into a lateral flow device capable of measuring levels of QSOX1. Our equivalent of a liquid biopsy test is a non-invasive, rapid blood test that will measure QSOX1 over-expression. Liquid biopsy refers to the process of testing the blood for the presence of a disease biomarker. Most so-called “liquid biopsy” companies test blood for circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) and DNA sequences. The disease biomarker we test for is an enzyme. We seek to prove that measuring QSOX1 over-expression, even before the tumor is formed, will enable detection of cancer at an earlier stage than liquid biopsy companies whose tests detect the CTC’s and DNA, usually after the tumor is formed and is shedding cells.

On January 13, 2020, Sapphire entered into an agreement with Skysong Innovations, LLC (“Skysong”) for an exclusive license to technology relating to SBI-183, an anti-metastatic compound suppressing tumor cell growth and blocking metastasis. As consideration for the license agreement, the Company agreed to grant Skysong (as licensing agent for Mayo Clinic Ventures and Arizona State University) 80,000 shares of Sapphire, which converted into 4,800,000 shares of Axim Biotechnologies, Inc., upon the merger.

Effective February 7, 2020, Sapphire entered into an Industry Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) to test and confirm the inhibitory activity of SBI-183 and SBI-183 analogs, including those synthesized by the Company. The testing included cell-based in vitro assays, NMR binding studies and testing to determine if SBI-183 enhances the activity of cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Animal studies were also be conducted under the SRA. Specifically SBI-183 analogs will be evaluated in a mouse model of triple negative breast cancer using human tumor xenografts. 

On August 11, 2020, Sapphire was awarded a $395,880 phase I Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grant by the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”). The 12-month grant supported the continued development of novel small molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activity of QSOX1 based on our lead compound SPX-1009. 

Funded by the SBIR, we have made significant progress with the development of additional analogs of SPX-1009 and have synthesizing derivative compounds with improved anti-metastatic action. We have synthesized and screened more than 200 derivatives of SPX-1009, yielding a compound with significantly increased anti-metastatic inhibition. Recent medicinal chemistry efforts resulted in SPX-184 compound that showed much higher activity than SPX-1009 in 3D invasion assays with MDA-MB-231cell line (MD Anderson cancer line). SPX-184 is up to 50 times more potent than SPX-1009 and constitutes a unique composition. Since it is not an analyte of SPX-1009, SPX-184 is not covered under the license with Skysong Innovations.

                We continue to advance our mission of developing novel therapeutics for controlling metastatic cancer spread, and diagnostics for early cancer detection, response to treatment, and for monitoring post-treatment recurrence. With Phase I of the SBIR now completed, we are preparing to file a Phase II, seeking $1 million in grant funding from the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health to further develop SPX-184. In addition to seeking additional grant funding to further our cancer research and development program, our strategies include potential partnering with a pharmaceutical company active in cancer therapeutic and/or licensing the technology so that it can be commercialized.

Status: The agreement was since been terminated.

On September 16, 2020, we filed the EUA application with the FDA for measuring COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in plasma and serum through its first-in-class rapid diagnostic test. Status: On January 2022, the FDA notified us that the priorities for testing had changed in favor of quantitative measurement of neutralizing antibodies Accordingly, the Company’s EUA for the qualitative test would no longer be considered.

On September 22, 2020, we announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) had issued the Company a new Notice of Allowance for a patent (Application No. 15/748,784) on anti-neoplastic compounds and methods targeting QSOX1, an enzyme important for tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis.

On September 29, 2020, we announced that we had filed a provisional patent for a first-in-class face mask that captures and deactivates SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

On December 31, 2020, we announced that we had filed a provisional patent for a recombinant VBP for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, and are now manufacturing the VBP. As a result, we no longer need to rely on outside protein supply to continue our research and can greatly cut down on our manufacturing costs.

On December 3, 2020, we announced the development and patent filing for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”)-based diagnostic test for the detection of SARS‐CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Status: Ongoing

On February 3, 2021, we announced the initiation of clinical trials for ImmunoPass, our rapid point-of-care test that semi-quantitatively measures levels of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. Status: Completed

On March 8, 2021, we announced that we had successfully completed point-of-care clinical trials on our much awaited ImmunoPass rapid test that semi-quantitatively measures levels of COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies to help understand COVID-19 immunity, validate vaccine’s effectiveness and estimate how long the vaccine will be effective in patients.

 On March 24, 2021, the Company, through Empowered Diagnostics, filed an EAU application with the FDA for measuring COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in whole blood for a Point-of-Care rapid diagnostic test. Status: This relationship has been terminated.

On August 03, 2021, we announced that the Company has signed a Binding Term Sheet to acquire the technology for the testing of Dry Eye Disease (DED), including two FDA authorizations and approvals for the commercial sale of two ophthalmic diagnostic lab tests. The transaction closed on August 26, 2021.

On March 6, 2022, we announced that while the Company explores filing one or more EUA’s for point of care and/or at home use, it would begin to sell the ImmunoPass rapid test For Research Use Only (“RUO”) as it does not require FDA approval.

On March 8, 2022, we announced that we had successfully developed what we believe to be the first-ever rapid quantitative tear test for MMP-9, an inflammatory biomarker for Dry Eye Disease. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an inflammatory biomarker consistently elevated in the tears of dry eye patients, may accelerate early diagnosis when detected.

I. QSOX1-RELATED INVENTIONS. 

QSOX1 (Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1) is an enzyme that is over-expressed in multiple tumor types. Genetically silencing QSOX1 in tumors slows their growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. Based on these findings, the inventors of the inventions described below tested libraries of chemical compounds for the ability to inhibit QSOX1. Several inhibitors of the QSOX1 enzyme were identified. Initially, SBI-183 was identified and animal studies confirmed its ability to suppress tumor growth. The inventors subsequently developed an entire library of analogs of the parent compound, SBI-183, detailed in several inventions below to identify compounds with greater inhibitory activity. These compounds have the potential to be developed into therapeutic treatments for metastasis and to be used in conjunction with other neoplastic treatments, such as chemotherapy.

Included in the group of QSOX1-related inventions below is the identification of a specific splice variant of QSOX1, identified as QSOX1-L, as a unique Biomarker for the detection of certain tumors overexpressing QSOX1.

IV. EYE HEALTH

1. Title: TEAR SAMPLE COLLECTORS, SYSTEMS AND METHODS 

U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/307,987 filed February 8, 2022.
Exclusive Assignee: Axim Biotechnologies, Inc. 

Tear fluid analysis contributes to the greater understanding of various ocular and systemic diseases and obtaining adequate samples for tear analysis requires effective collection methods. Most tear sample collectors on the market use capillary designs as tear sample collectors. These designs are intimidating to the patient when a sharp looking object is approaching the eye, are rather difficult to use by untrained personnel and are expensive to manufacture. Quidel InflammaDry is using a wick type tear sample collector that does not have any fill-up indicator and is rather intricate to produce on mass scale. Other prototype sample collectors employ Q-tip designs, filter paper strips (Schirmer’s test) are imprecise, some are difficult to produce en masse. Here we introduce a laminated and looped tear sample collectors that addresses the above problems and that are: 1) Cost-effective to produce on mass scale 2) Features a fill-up indicator (in case of laminated version) 3) Easy to use 4)Soft and non-intimidating to user and patient.

The invention relates to a Rapid Point of Care test for Human Monomeric Lacritin. Lacritin is a tear protein that, in its monomeric form, autonomously promotes tearing and ocular surface survival. Lacritin is the only identified growth-like factor decreased in tears from patients with ocular surface inflammation resulting from blepharitis, and it is downregulated in contact lens-related dry eye. This provisional describes six different lateral flow assay designs for the detection of monomeric lacritin from human tears to diagnose blepharitis, Sjögren’s syndrome, Dry Eye Disease and other inflammatory conditions or as a companion diagnostics at point of care settings.
V. TRADEMARKS

We have two trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office: Axim (Registration Date: May 19, 2015; and A Axim Biotech (Registration Date: May 31, 2016).

Market, Customers and Distribution Methods

Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. We plan to be an active player in the field of biosciences with our extensive R&D and pipeline of innovative products. Currently, our eye business focuses exclusively on ophthalmology and optometry, in the United States, where there are 37,000 optometrists and 19,000 ophthalmologists performing approximately 400,000 medical (dilated) eye exams per day. 
Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. 

We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies.

While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for Covid-19 NAb product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. 

The barrier for entrance into the dry eye space is difficult and requires extensive clinical studies, large capital expense and FDA 510k approval. This process alone can take several years and substantial investment, with no certainty that the product will receive FDA 510k approval. It is estimated that as of 2021, the total Company funding necessary to develop a Class II 510k cleared medical device is approximately $30 million. The development and engineering costs comprise approximately $2-5 million of this total. There are many factors that influence these costs, including the need for clinical studies, regulatory pathway and technology complexity.

We believe that we are well situated in the Eye Health sector with two 510(k) cleared tests. Additionally, the preferred clinical analysis is quantitative, giving us an advantage over the competition. Since our reader can interpret many different analytes other than Lf and IgE, it also opens the possibility of additional quantitative test development.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials that we use to manufacture our products and product candidates and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for clinical trials, and if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by us.

We currently manufacture the majority of our preclinical and Covid-19 testing materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation.

In the dye eye segment, we either make our reagents or they are sourced from select suppliers. We use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our assays and readers.

Government Regulation

Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Many, if not all of our customers, are covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of August 1996 or HIPAA. As part of the operation of our business, we provide reimbursement assistance to certain of our customers and as a result we act in the capacity of a business associate with respect to any patient-identifiable medical information, or PHI, we receive in connection with these services. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements related to the handling of patient information, including laws and regulations protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of PHI. The provisions of HIPAA require our customers to have business associate agreements with us under which we are required to appropriately safeguard the PHI we create or receive on their behalf. Further, we and our customers are required to comply with HIPAA security regulations that require us and them to implement certain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI, or EPHI. We are required by regulation and contract to protect the security of EPHI that we create, receive, maintain or transmit for our customers consistent with these regulations. To comply with our regulatory and contractual obligations, we may have to reorganize processes and invest in new technologies. We also are required to train personnel regarding HIPAA requirements. If we, or any of our employees or consultants, are unable to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the PHI that is entrusted to us, we and/or our customers could be subject to civil and criminal fines and sanctions and we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and recent omnibus revisions to the HIPAA regulations, we are directly subject to HIPAA’s criminal and civil penalties for breaches of our privacy and security obligations and are required to comply with security breach notification requirements. The direct applicability of the HIPAA privacy and security provisions and compliance with the notification requirements requires us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations.

U.S. Government Regulation

Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of our product, which is a medical device. In the United States, the FDA regulates medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, administrative fines or criminal prosecution.

Unless exempted by regulation, medical devices may not be commercially distributed in the United States until they have been cleared or approved by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of the three classes, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Class II devices, which our two test for lactoferrin and IgE are classified are subject to general controls, such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to good manufacturing practices. Laboratories or sites that perform our tests need to have a CLIA certificate, be inspected, and must meet the CLIA quality standards.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification to the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, would require a new 510(k) clearance or an approval of a Premarket Approval, or PMA. A PMA is the FDA process of scientific or regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices which are those devices which support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Although the FDA requires the manufacturer to make the initial determination regarding the effect of a modification to the device that is subject to 510(k) clearance, the FDA can review the manufacturer’s determination at any time and require the manufacturer to seek another 510(k) clearance or an approval of a PMA. 

CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of in vitro diagnostic tests: (1) waiver; (2) moderately complex; and (3) highly complex. The standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of diagnostic tests it performs. A CLIA waiver is available to clinical laboratory test systems if they meet certain requirements established by the statute. Waived tests are simple laboratory examinations and procedures employing methodologies that are so simple and accurate as to render the likelihood of erroneous results negligible or to pose no reasonable risk of harm to patients if the examinations or procedures are performed incorrectly. These tests are waived from regulatory oversight of the user other than the requirement to follow the manufacturer’s labeling and directions for use. We intend to file a waiver application with the FDA for the Axim Eye System.

Regardless of whether a medical device requires FDA clearance or approval, a number of other FDA requirements apply to the device, its manufacturer and those who distribute it. Device manufacturers must be registered and their products listed with the FDA, and certain adverse events and product malfunctions must be reported to the FDA. The FDA also regulates the product labeling, promotion and, in some cases, advertising of medical devices. In addition, manufacturers and their suppliers must comply with the FDA’s quality system regulation which establishes extensive requirements for quality and manufacturing procedures. Thus, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance, and failure to comply can lead to enforcement action. The FDA periodically inspects facilities to ascertain compliance with these and other requirements.

Environmental Matters

No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our current operations, and we do not anticipate that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. Furthermore, compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
