ITEM 1. Business.
General
 We are one of the leading suppliers of replacement parts and fasteners for passenger cars and light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 25, 2021, we marketed approximately 118,000 distinct parts compared to approximately 81,000 as of December 26, 2020, many of which we designed and engineered. This number excludes private label stock keeping units and other variations in how we market, package and distribute our products, includes distinct parts of acquired companies and reflects distinct parts that have been discontinued at the end of their lifecycle. The increase in the number of distinct parts in 2021 was largely driven by our acquisition of Dayton Parts. We are one of the leading aftermarket suppliers of original equipment (“OE”) “dealer exclusive” parts. Original equipment “dealer exclusive” parts are those which were traditionally available to professional installers and consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or used parts from salvage yards and include, among other parts, leaf springs, intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers and complex electronics modules. Fasteners include such items as oil drain plugs, wheel bolts, and wheel lug nuts. For fiscal 2021, approximately 73% of our products were sold under brands that we own, and the remainder of our products were sold for resale under customers' private labels, other brands or in bulk. Our products are sold primarily in the United States through automotive aftermarket retailers, including through their online platforms; national, regional and local warehouse distributors; and specialty markets, and salvage yards. We also distribute automotive aftermarket parts internationally, with sales primarily into Canada and Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. 
The Automotive Aftermarket Industry
 The automotive aftermarket industry has two distinct sectors: parts for passenger cars and light trucks, which according to the 2022 Auto Care Association Factbook, accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $324.8 billion in 2021, and parts for medium and heavy-duty trucks, which accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $94.4 billion in 2021. We sell products into both sectors, with a majority of our products being designed for the passenger car and light truck sector. Our acquisition of Dayton Parts in 2021 increased our product offerings in the medium and heavy-duty truck sector.
 Two distinct groups of end-users buy replacement vehicle parts for passenger cars and light trucks: (i) individual consumers, who purchase parts to perform "do-it-yourself" repairs on their own vehicles; and (ii) professional installers, which include vehicle repair shops and dealership service departments. Individual consumers typically are supplied through retailers and the retail arms of warehouse distributors. Vehicle repair shops generally purchase parts through local independent parts wholesalers and national parts distributors. Automobile dealership service departments generally obtain parts through the distribution systems of vehicle manufacturers and specialized national and regional parts distributors.
 The largest purchasers of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle aftermarket parts are OE manufacturers, independent distributors, including organizations associated with large buying groups and other distributors, as well as independent component specialists and rebuilders, and auto parts stores. The service work performed on medium- and heavy-duty vehicles is generally completed by end user businesses that utilize these vehicles in their operations, fleets, and independent garages and distributors, who buy parts from the purchasers above or in some instances directly from suppliers like us.
 Spending in the aftermarket for parts for passenger cars and light trucks, as well as medium and heavy-duty trucks, generally can be grouped into three categories: discretionary, maintenance, and repair. Discretionary, such as accessories and performance, tends to move in-line with consumer discretionary spending. Maintenance is composed of products and services, such as oil and oil changes, and tends to be 
 3


less correlated with discretionary spending. Repair consists mainly of replacement parts that fail over time and tends to be less cyclical as it is largely comprised of parts necessary for a vehicle to function properly or safely. The majority of our products fall into the repair category. 
 The increasing complexity and the number of different makes and models of automobiles have resulted in a significant increase in the number of products required to service the domestic and foreign automotive fleets. Accordingly, the number of parts required to be carried by retailers and wholesale distributors has increased substantially, which is reflected in the increase in the number of distinct parts we marketed in 2021 as compared to 2020. The requirement to include more products in inventory and the significant consolidation among distributors of automotive replacement parts have in turn resulted in larger distributors. See ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our Industry, Operations and Competition” for information regarding the potential impacts of consolidation on our business.
 Retailers and others who purchase automotive aftermarket parts for resale are constrained to a finite amount of space in which to display and stock products. Thus, the reputation for quality, customer service, and line profitability that a supplier provides are significant factors in a retailer’s or other reseller’s decision as to which product lines to carry in the limited space available. Further, because of the efficiencies achieved through the ability to order all or part of a complete line of products from one supplier (with possible volume discounts), as opposed to satisfying the same requirements through a variety of different sources, retailers and other resellers of automotive aftermarket parts often seek to purchase products from fewer but stronger suppliers.
 Brands and Products
 We market our products under the DORMAN® and Dayton Parts® brand names and several sub-brands, which identify products that address specific segments of the automotive aftermarket industry. In addition, across all our sub-brands, customers can find a subset of products that have been branded DORMAN® OE FIX™ products. 


Some of our most popular brands include:

 We group our products into four major classes: powertrain, chassis, automotive body, and hardware. The following table represents each of the four classes as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years:

 | Percentage of Net Sales | 
----------------+-------------------------+----
 | Year Ended | 
 | December 25, 2021 | | | December 26, 2020 | | December 28, 2019
Powertrain | | 40 | % | | 40 | % | 40 | %
Chassis | | 34 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | %
Automotive Body | | 22 | % | | 25 | % | 25 | %
Hardware | | 4 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | %
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 Our powertrain product line includes intake and exhaust manifolds, cooling products, harmonic balancers, fluid lines, fluid reservoirs, connectors, 4-wheel drive components and axles, drain plugs, and other engine, transmission and axle components. Chassis products include control arms, ball joints, tie-rod ends, brake hardware and hydraulics, wheel and axle hardware, suspension arms, knuckles, links, bushings, leaf springs, and other suspension, steering, and brake components. Our line of automotive body products includes door handles and hinges, window lift motors, window regulators, switches and handles, wiper components, lighting, electrical, and other interior and exterior automotive body components. Hardware products include threaded bolts and auto body fasteners, automotive and home electrical wiring components, and other hardware assortments and merchandise. 
 We warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as designed on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on most of our products. Our standard warranty limits the end-user’s remedy to the repair or replacement of the part that is defective. 
 Product Development
 Product development and continuous innovation are central to our business. The development of a broad range of products, many of which are not conveniently or economically available elsewhere, historically has enabled us to grow and is an important driver for our future growth. Our product strategy has been to design and engineer products, many of which we believe are better and easier to install and/or use than the original parts they replace, and to commercialize automotive parts for the broadest possible range of uses. All new product ideas are reviewed by our product management staff and a cross-functional in-house team to determine potential improvements and inclusions that will create a better user experience. The following table represents the number of distinct parts we introduced for each of the last three fiscal years: 

 | Year Ended | 
--------------------------------+-------------------+------
 | December 25, 2021 | | December 26, 2020 | | December 28, 2019
New to the aftermarket | | 990 | | 1,433 | | 1,625
Line extensions | | 3,325 | | 2,046 | | 3,614
Total distinct parts introduced | | 4,315 | | 3,479 | | 5,239

 In 2021, we introduced several new product categories to the aftermarket including: a new upgraded Dorman® OE FIX™ aluminum oil filter housing solution, aftermarket-exclusive hub rotor and caliper bracket bolt kits, and new complex electronic solutions, such as cruise control distance sensors, blind spot 
 5


detection modules and other advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) products. Each of these solutions gives installers and consumers additional choice when searching for reliable, affordable replacements.
 Other innovative technologies we released in 2021 include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) emission components, including heaters and pumps, and new electronic power steering rack solutions. We also continued our efforts to find ways to further simplify customer installation efforts through new combination solutions, such as pre-pressed axle and bearing assemblies.
 Our product teams also grow and expand existing categories by introducing new products that are designed to fit more vehicles, providing enhanced opportunities for aftermarket service providers to serve their customers. In 2021, we extended our lines in strategic core categories such as window regulators, chassis and control arms, valve covers, manifolds, and drive shafts.
 Some of our most popular innovations are those that provide vehicle owners significant savings over other repair alternatives, such as rust repair solutions. Our truck bed floor supports, differential covers and fuel tank crossmembers often eliminate the need to replace entire truck beds, axles and other large vehicle sections by facilitating direct repair of corroded components.
 We also grew our lines of heavy-duty solutions in fiscal 2021 through the acquisition of Dayton Parts, which lines include leaf springs, brake drums, and various other steering and suspension products. In addition to these new solutions from Dayton Parts, we also introduced hundreds of new products into our Dorman® HD Solutions™ line, including a new Diesel Decoder™ tool that enables scanning of engine diagnostics, new exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves, and various new engine and emission sensors.
Sales and Marketing
 We market our products to three groups of purchasers who in turn supply individual consumers and professional installers. Our products are also available in our customers’ retail stores, on our customers’ websites, and through warehouse distributors. For the year ended December 25, 2021:
 (i) approximately 56% of our net sales was generated from sales to automotive aftermarket retailers, including major chains such as Advance, AutoZone and O'Reilly;
 (ii) approximately 33% of our net sales was generated from sales to warehouse distributors, such as NAPA, which may be local, regional or national in scope, and which also may engage in retail sales; and
 (iii) approximately 11% of our net sales was generated from our heavy-duty channel including through national, regional, and local warehouse distributors, such as FleetPride, and specialty service shops, and sales to other markets, which include, among others, salvage yards and the parts distribution systems of OE parts manufacturers as well as mass merchants, such as Walmart, for our home electrical wiring components.
 As of December 25, 2021, we had a sales and sales support team of over 120 people selling our products either directly to our customers or, with respect to certain select customers, indirectly through independent manufacturers’ representative agencies worldwide.
 Our sales efforts are not directed merely at selling individual products, but more broadly towards selling our entire product portfolio. Our sales strategy includes increasing sales not only by securing new customers, but also by adding new product lines and expanding product selection within existing customers in an effort to make our customers a destination for new-to-the-aftermarket products.
 We use catalogs, application guides, digital marketing tools, training materials, videos and additional content to describe and sell our products and other applications as well as to train our customers' sales teams. Our primary website, www.dormanproducts.com, provides a search engine that can be used to search our extensive catalog. The information on the website is not and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

As of December 25, 2021, we serviced more than 4,500 active accounts. During fiscal 2021, three customers each accounted for more than 10% of net sales and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 54% of net sales.
 Manufacturing and Procurement
 Most of our products are manufactured by third parties. We engage third-party manufacturers around the world to develop and manufacture products according to our performance and design requirements, oftentimes using tooling that we own. In fiscal 2021, as a percentage of our total dollar volume of purchases, approximately 26% of our products were purchased from various suppliers throughout the United States and the balance of our products were purchased directly from suppliers outside of the United States. Our global supplier network provides access to a broad array of manufacturing capabilities and technologies while limiting our dependency on any single source of supply. While our supplier selection and sourcing programs will continue to leverage our strategic manufacturers for a substantial portion of our product portfolio, we also have qualified alternative sources available to provide additional support and capacity, if needed. We make a concerted effort to build and nurture strong, healthy relationships with our suppliers. In fiscal 2021, we purchased automotive products in substantial volumes from over 250 suppliers, and no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of our total product purchases in fiscal 2021. 
Packaging, Inventory and Shipping
 Finished products acquired from third-party suppliers are received at one or more of our facilities, depending on the type of part. It is our practice to inspect samples of shipments based upon supplier performance. If cleared, these shipments of finished parts are logged into our computerized production tracking systems and staged for packaging, if necessary. 
 We employ a variety of custom-designed packaging machines which include blister sealing, skin film sealing, clamshell sealing, bagging and boxing lines. Packaged product generally contains our label (or a private label), a part number, a universal packaging bar code suitable for electronic scanning, a description of the part and, if appropriate, installation instructions. Products are also sold in bulk to automotive parts manufacturers and packagers. Computerized tracking systems, mechanical counting devices and experienced workers combine to help ensure that the proper variety and numbers of parts meet the correct packaging materials at the appropriate places and times to produce the required quantities of finished products.
 Packaged inventory is either stocked in the warehouse portions of our facilities or in distribution centers maintained by our third-party logistics providers and is organized to facilitate the most efficient methods of retrieving product to fill customer orders. We strive to maintain a level of inventory to adequately meet current customer order demand with additional inventory to satisfy new customer orders and special programs. 
 We ship our products by contract carrier, common carrier or parcel service. Products are generally shipped to each customer's main warehouses for redistribution within its network. In certain circumstances, at the request of a customer, we ship directly to that customer's warehouses, stores or other locations either via smaller direct ship orders or consolidated store orders that are cross docked.
 Remanufacturing and Recycling Parts
 Certain products we sell contain parts that can be recycled, or as more commonly referred to in our industry, remanufactured. We refer to the used product that is ultimately remanufactured as core. A used core is remanufactured and sold to the customer as a replacement for a unit on a vehicle. Customers and end-users that purchase a remanufactured replacement part will generally return the used core to us, which we then use in the remanufacturing process to make another finished good. Our core inventory consists of used cores purchased and held in our facilities, used cores that are in the process of being returned from our customers and end-users, and remanufactured cores held in finished goods inventory at our facilities. Our 
 7


products that utilize cores include electronic control modules, hybrid batteries and complex mechatronics. We believe our remanufactured parts offer end-users an economical and safe way to maintain their cars on the road, while also reducing the impact to environment.
 Competition
 The automotive aftermarket industry is highly competitive. Competitive factors affecting the automotive aftermarket include price, product quality, breadth of product line, range of applications, customer service and the growth of e-commerce. Substantially all our products are subject to competition with similar products offered by other providers of automotive aftermarket repair and replacement parts. Some of these competitors are divisions and subsidiaries of companies much larger than us who possess a longer history of operations and greater financial and other resources than we do. We also face competition from OE manufacturers who sell through their dealerships many of the same replacement parts that we sell, although these manufacturers generally sell parts only for cars they produce. Our customers may also be successful in sourcing some of our products directly from our suppliers. Further, some of our private label customers also compete with us. For more information on risks relating to our competition, see ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our Industry, Operations and Competition.”
 Seasonality
 Our business can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather generally results in an increase in automotive parts failure at an accelerated rate, which generally leads to an increase in our sales for the duration of the extreme weather event. 
 Impact of COVID-19
 While COVID-19 did not adversely affect demand for our products for the year ended December 25, 2021, during the year we did experience pandemic-related pressures in the global supply network that caused logistical issues, including higher freight costs, supplier lead time delays of products and inflation with respect to materials and labor costs, which impacted our results. As countries continue to combat COVID-19, and as government-imposed regulations regarding, among other things, COVID-19 testing, vaccine mandates and related workplace restrictions change around the world, there is still a risk that the pandemic may impact the overall demand environment as well as our ability to maintain staffing at our facilities, to source parts and other materials to meet demand levels, to maintain inventory levels and to fulfill contractual requirements. We will continue to closely monitor updates regarding the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, the distribution of vaccines developed to combat COVID-19, and applicable vaccine mandates, and we will adjust our operations according to guidelines from local, state and federal officials. In light of the foregoing, we may take actions that alter our business operations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
 For a more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “Human Capital Resources” below and ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impacts of COVID-19.”
 Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We own a number of patents important to our business, and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our research and development investments in new products. As of December 25, 2021, we held 74 patents and 14 pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. For the United States, patents may last 20 years from the date of the patent's filing, depending upon term adjustments made by the patent office. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks in the United States and other countries. We also have licenses to intellectual property for the manufacture, use and sale of certain of our products.

We obtain patent and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Historically, we have done so both organically, through commercial relationships and in connection with acquisitions.
 For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, see ITEM 1A, "Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Our Intellectual Property and Information Security.”
 Human Capital Resources
 General
 As of December 25, 2021, we had 3,360 employees worldwide, substantially all of whom were employed full-time. Our employees are categorized by various functions. “Operations” consists of employees engaged in production, product distribution and inventory quality control. “Product Development” includes employees involved in product development and purchasing. “Quality and Engineering” consists of employees involved in internal and external quality management, manufacturing engineering, design, and testing. “Sales” includes employees employed in sales and customer service. “Administration” includes executive officers and individuals employed in finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other functions supporting our business. The following table shows employees by function and region.

 | December 25, 2021 | 
------------------------+-------------------+------
 | U.S. | | Non-U.S. | | Total
Operations | | 2,534 | | 78 | | 2,612
Product Development | | 162 | | 2 | | 164 
Quality and Engineering | | 162 | | 39 | | 201 
Sales | | 161 | | 14 | | 175 
Administration | | 208 | | — | | 208 
Total Employees | | 3,227 | | 133 | | 3,360

 None of our global employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be generally good.
 Health and Safety
 We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We have created and implemented processes to help eliminate safety events and reduce their frequency and severity. We also review and monitor our performance closely. In 2021, we adopted an environmental, health and safety policy outlining our commitment to policies and practices that support the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community, and the protection of the environment in the communities where we operate. We also implemented a human rights policy for the organization outlining our commitment to operating with respect for human rights.
 In response to COVID-19, we implemented and continue to maintain enhanced safety measures in all our facilities to promote the health and welfare of our employees. We provided employees with communications and education programs designed to encourage employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when eligible and provided on-site vaccination clinics at our facilities. In addition, we maintain a COVID-19 sick leave policy providing continued salary and benefits to eligible employees.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 We embrace the diversity of our employees, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Employees are valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. As part of our commitment to diversity, 
 9


in 2021, we appointed our first Vice President of Development and Diversity, responsible for leading our diversity and inclusion strategy. Moreover, in 2021, we launched our “All In” initiative, a summit focused on inviting our employees to think and engage more with ideas such as diversity and inclusion to foster a collaborative environment.
 As part of our commitment to a culture of inclusion, our Contributor Resource Group ("CRG") Program broadens and enhances company-wide interaction opportunities for our employees. Our CRG is open to all and involves activities for employees whose background is the focus of the CRG and those who are supportive of the groups that have been formed. These company-wide networks build on and coordinate with local teams that are already active in our operations and include groups such as those focused on the experiences of Women, Veteran’s, Multi-Cultural and Early Career Employees.
 Talent and Development
 Our talent strategy is focused on attracting the best talent, developing their skillsets and experiences and rewarding their performance. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our leadership team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Leadership also reviews employee engagement surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues. 
Compensation
 We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry and in the geographies in which we compete for talent. We conduct an executive compensation benchmarking review annually to help ensure we are providing market-based compensation including base salary, short-term incentive and long-term incentives. We also participate in annual compensation surveys for all positions and strive to compensate our top talent and key roles competitively. Moreover, we believe our long-term incentives are structured in a manner to provide time-based vesting schedules that are retentive. 
 For information on risks relating to our human capital resources, see ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – Losing the services of our executive officers or other highly qualified and experienced employees, or failing to attract and retain any of such officers or employees, could adversely affect our business.”
