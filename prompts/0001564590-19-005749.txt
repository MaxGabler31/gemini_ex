ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

 The Habit Burger Grill is a burger-centric, fast casual restaurant concept that specializes in preparing fresh, made-to-order char-grilled burgers and sandwiches featuring USDA choice tri-tip steak, grilled chicken and sushi-grade tuna cooked over an open flame. In addition, we feature fresh made-to-order salads and an appealing selection of sides, shakes and malts. The char-grilled preparation of our fresh burgers, topped with caramelized onions and fresh produce, has generated tremendous consumer response, resulting in our burger being named the “best tasting burger in America” in July 2014 in a comprehensive survey conducted by one of America’s leading consumer magazines.
 We believe our restaurant concept delivers a highly differentiated customer experience by combining the quality and hospitality that customers commonly associate with our full service and fast casual restaurant competitors with the convenience and value customers generally expect from traditional fast food restaurants. Four pillars form the foundation of our brand:
  
• | Quality. At the core of our differentiated model is a company-wide commitment to quality, beginning with our food.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Environment. Our restaurants are enhanced with abundant natural light, hardwood, polished stone countertops and a spacious dining area featuring soft vinyl booths, high-top tables and community table seating. Our open kitchen showcases our made-to-order preparation and exemplifies our commitment to freshness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospitality. We seek to exceed our customers’ expectations for service and believe our ability to consistently deliver genuine hospitality begins with our employees.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value. Our combination of high-quality food, welcoming environment and genuine hospitality, all delivered at a low price, strengthens the value proposition for our customers. For instance, the price for our original Charburger with cheese ranges from $3.95 to $4.59 at our company-operated locations, which is below similar items on the menus of most competing fast casual restaurants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The first Habit Burger Grill opened in Santa Barbara, California in 1969. Our restaurant concept has been, and continues to be, built around a distinctive and diverse menu, headlined by fresh, char-grilled burgers and sandwiches made-to-order over an open flame and topped with fresh ingredients. Our Chief Executive Officer, Russell W. Bendel, joined The Habit in 2008, and since then we have grown our brand on a disciplined basis. Our highly experienced management team has created and refined our infrastructure to deliver replicable restaurant-level systems, processes and training procedures that can deliver a high-quality experience that is designed to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations.

 For the definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, to net income, see the section entitled “Item 6, Selected Financial Data.’’ Management has determined that we have one reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial performance and allocates resources at a consolidated level on a recurring basis.
 Our Competitive Strengths—“The Habit Difference”
 Quality. Quality is a key ingredient in everything we do and our commitment to quality starts with our food. The Habit offers a diverse menu featuring a distinctive char-grilled preparation technique to deliver an appealing variety of burgers, chicken, tuna and steak featured in our sandwiches and salads, which are made-to-order using fresh ingredients. Chargrilling is part of what gives our entrées at the Habit bold flavors and we believe “it’s not the same, without the flame!”
 It is our mission to become everyone’s favorite Habit, one burger at a time. We believe that every burger should be made-to-order, char-grilled over an open flame, topped with your choice of lettuce, ripe tomatoes, caramelized onions and melted cheese, wrapped neatly in paper and served alongside hot, crispy fries. Our burger selection ranges from our award-winning original Charburger including your choice of mayonnaise, pickles, ripe tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions served on a toasted bun, to our Santa Barbara style Charburger including all the fixings of the original Charburger plus cheese and avocado served on grilled sourdough. Burgers accounted for approximately 59% of our entrée revenue for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018. Our sandwich selection offers a variety of choices, featuring sushi-grade tuna, fresh chicken and USDA choice steak and we also offer a variety of salad options, which are key to further diversifying our menu.
 Environment. We invest in our restaurant design to deliver a warm and inviting atmosphere enhanced with abundant natural light, polished stone and exposed hardwood accents. Our average restaurant size is between 2,000 and 2,800 square feet and features booth, high-top and community table seating, along with outdoor patios in most of our restaurant locations. Our open kitchen showcases our made-to-order preparation and exemplifies our commitment to freshness. We believe the attractive design of our restaurants and our commitment to delivering superior service makes us a desirable destination at any time of day, which we believe contributed to a balanced day part mix of 50% lunch and 50% dinner for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018.
 Hospitality. We hire and train individuals who share our passion for food and deliver friendly, attentive service by engaging customers the moment they enter our restaurants and maintaining this level of service throughout their visit. We believe our ability to deliver high-quality service is a function of our relationship with our employees, and we therefore focus on fostering an atmosphere of teamwork and support with a clear path toward promotion within the company. We have developed a proprietary training system for professional development of the entire team, and we believe that by offering our employees great opportunities for ongoing professional development, they in turn remain committed to providing our customers with an experience that exceeds expectations.

Value. We have developed a formula for customer value by delivering high-quality food, a welcoming environment and genuine hospitality, all at an attractive price point. We believe The Habit’s formula brings a highly differentiated experience to the fast casual restaurant segment by combining the quality, convenience and hospitality commonly associated with our casual dining and fast casual competitors at a price point that is below the low end of the average range of the fast casual segment. The price for our char-grilled, made-to-order Charburger combination meal with fries and a regular drink ranges from $7.49 to $8.73 at our company-operated locations, which provides our customers with a meal that is priced below comparable menu options at many competing fast casual restaurant alternatives.
 Productive Restaurants
 For the 52 weeks ended December 25, 2018, our restaurants that had been open for 12 months or more had an AUV of approximately $1.9 million and generated cash-on-cash returns in excess of 40%.
 Our restaurant model is designed to generate high sales volumes and high cash-on-cash returns.
 Cash-on-cash returns are typically defined as the ratio of annual restaurant contribution divided by the total amount of capital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances for a new restaurant, expressed as a percentage. High cash-on-cash returns are generally considered 30% or higher. We believe our ability to generate AUVs of approximately $1.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018 at our relatively low average per customer spend amount is indicative of our ability to generate traffic and deliver superior restaurant-level execution. Our ability to generate traffic, with an average weekly customer count of approximately 4,000 customers per restaurant location, serves as a benefit to adjacent retail businesses and therefore makes The Habit a desirable tenant for landlords and developers, who seek to find tenants that increase traffic in their retail developments.
 Our menu variety and quality offerings contribute to the productivity of our restaurants and positions The Habit as an attractive destination for a range of occasions, including a convenient lunch option, an after-school gathering spot for students, a social venue for seniors or an affordable restaurant for families. We believe our ability to drive traffic across both the lunch and dinner day parts allowed us to deliver an attractive per annum sales per leasable square foot of $752 for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018.
 Broad Customer Appeal
 Based on a 2014 external research report and a third-party customer satisfaction survey, our customer base is well-balanced with 55% male customers and 45% female customers. We believe our female customers represent a highly desirable customer base with strong influence on a family’s mealtime decision-making process, making them strong brand advocates who appreciate the quality and diversity of our menu offerings. Our customer base extends across age and socioeconomic groups, enabling us to successfully operate restaurants within a variety of communities of varying sizes, ethnic diversity and income ranges. Over 60% of our customer base is in the age range of 25 to 54. Families with children under the age of 18 represent a significant segment of this customer base. We believe our diversified customer base and menu variety contributed to our balanced day part mix of 50% lunch and 50% dinner for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018, which in turn contributed to our strong AUVs.
Site Development and Expansion
 Site Selection Process
 We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in its long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential locations. We have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our restaurant development efforts are led by our highly experienced senior management team and our in-house real estate team. Collectively, they have extensive experience identifying and qualifying suitable restaurant locations with restaurant concepts such as The Cheesecake Factory, Panda Express, Baja Fresh Mexican Grill, Jack in the Box, El Pollo Loco, Mimi’s Café, Black Bear Diner, Smashburger and Rubio’s Fresh Mexican Grill.

Our site selection process includes extensive data collection, strategic mapping and competitive analysis and we proactively seek new restaurant locations based on specific criteria, such as demographic characteristics, daytime population and residential density thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. Our restaurant concept works in a range of location types due to the flexibility of our restaurant design, the balanced sales mix across day parts and guest demographics. Most of our restaurants are located in grocery anchored strip centers, power centers anchored by big box regional retailers and free-standing locations. To assist in our analysis of a potential restaurant location, we focus on locating near traffic generators, such as office buildings, hospitals, movie theaters, recreational parks, high schools and colleges, as well as preferred co-tenants with similar customer demographics to The Habit. While we have typically targeted end-cap locations, we have expanded the number of drive-thru locations in our store openings and we also have the flexibility to operate inline and free-standing locations. We believe there is an opportunity to open more drive-thru locations going forward, which require increased investment costs but generate higher AUVs and generally result in a return on investment similar to our traditional locations. Our ability to succeed in various trade area and real estate types has provided us with flexibility in our market development strategy and has lowered operating risk when selecting new restaurant locations.
 Restaurant Design
 After securing a restaurant site, we commence our restaurant buildout. Our average restaurant size is between 2,000 and 2,800 square feet and features a comfortable dining room offering booth, high-top and community table seating, along with outdoor patios. Each of our restaurants has a customized layout to optimize the available space with consistent design cues that contribute to our customers’ experiences. The dining area of our typical restaurant can seat approximately 30 to 50 people, and if the location has a patio, the patio will accommodate approximately 25 to 35 additional people.
 Our new restaurant model targets an average investment of approximately $895,000, net of tenant allowances for traditional non-drive-thru locations and approximately $1,075,000, net of tenant allowances, for drive-thru locations, which blends to an average target investment of $1,025,000, net of tenant allowances. We believe our investment in the construction of our restaurant location enables us to provide a differentiated experience for customers due to our focus on the finer details of our restaurant design, which generates broad customer appeal. Our restaurants provide a warm and welcoming atmosphere enhanced with abundant natural light, exposed hardwood accents, polished stone countertops, active California lifestyle watercolor artwork and generally provide ample indoor and patio seating space. The entrance of each of our restaurants is designed to include easy to read menu boards and comfortable waiting benches for to-go orders. Each of our restaurants also includes a designated area for customers to serve their own drink, access the pepper bar or pick one of our flavorful sauces. We believe the atmosphere of our restaurants creates an inviting environment where friends and family can gather throughout the day, encourages repeat visits, inspires brand advocacy and drives increased sales.
 The development and construction of our new sites is the responsibility of our real estate, development and construction teams. Our Chief Development Officer oversees the development process that prepares a new restaurant for turnover to operations.
 Restaurant Management and Operations
 Service
 We seek to deliver an experience and atmosphere at The Habit that our customers want to share with family and friends. Our focus on superior restaurant-level execution to enhance our customers’ experiences is instilled within every one of our employees. We make an effort to hire team members who share our passion for food, exhibit a consistently positive attitude and high degree of integrity, approach their jobs with a team mentality and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards. We believe that we attract genuine, friendly employees at The Habit, and then reinforce and reward such employees’ dedication to hospitality which helps us to consistently provide high levels of service to our customers and differentiate our dining experience from that of our competitors.

Our team members are empowered to improve the experience of our customers and directly address any customer concerns, which we believe contributes to the success of our business. We encourage our team members to take responsibility for our dining room environment and personally visit tables to ensure our customers’ satisfaction. Our cashiers are extensively trained on the menu items and offer customers thoughtful suggestions to enhance their ordering process. The pepper bar and beverage stations are continuously monitored for cleanliness and an ample supply of products.
 A meaningful portion of our customers also visit The Habit for on-the-go meals, where speed and efficiency are of utmost importance. We offer mobile and online ordering supported by a dedicated call center to enhance the ordering experience. In 2018, we added the option of delivery in the majority of our restaurants. We are also using tablets in selected restaurants to expedite drive-thru ordering and are also using the tablets for in-store use in selected locations to facilitate faster customer ordering during peak hours. We are also piloting an enhanced mobile ordering application and we are testing a kiosk solution as ordering alternatives for our customers. We value our customers’ time and target an average cook time of six to eight minutes to complete the order, allowing our teams to properly execute the made-to-order preparation of our fresh ingredients and still cater to the busy schedules of our customers.
 In order to maintain our high level of customer service, we have implemented a Customer Service Evaluation system. We measure team performance using specific metrics, including positive attitude and engagement with our customers. All captured data can be analyzed by category or broad measures, including region or district, and the results are reviewed by our corporate and restaurant-level management on a monthly basis and comprise a meaningful portion of each restaurant location’s quarterly bonus plan.
 
Operations
 At The Habit, we believe that superior execution leads to superior results. We focus on offering our customers a high-quality and consistent experience every time they visit us and have implemented disciplined operating systems aimed at measuring our ability to deliver this high-quality experience. These systems include restaurant operating reviews, customer service evaluations and speed of service performance standards. Corporate and restaurant-level management utilize the information to identify strengths and opportunities and develop specific plans for continuous performance improvement.
 We employ a customer-centered approach to our restaurant operations, which we also believe is fundamental to our success. Each of our restaurants is typically staffed with a restaurant manager, at least two assistant managers and an average of approximately 25 dedicated team members who prepare our food fresh daily and deliver outstanding customer service. We cross-train our employees in an effort to create a depth of competency in our critical restaurant functions. Our District Managers are, on average, responsible for approximately five restaurants, which allows them 
 
5


to visit each restaurant regularly and maintain a frequent dialogue with our restaurant managers. Similarly, our Directors of Operations are each responsible for between approximately six and nine districts to ensure they are accessible and attentive to the needs and performance of the restaurants in their regions.
 In addition, we conduct quarterly operating reviews by our in-house quality assurance team members of each of our restaurants to ensure that each restaurant meets our high operational standards. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources, which includes our supply chain and quality assurance teams, to help ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. We have taken various steps to ensure food quality and mitigate safety risks. Our restaurants undergo internal safety audits and routine health inspections. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers.
 Training
 We are selective in our hiring processes, aiming to staff our restaurants with team members that are friendly, customer focused, and driven to perform high-quality work. We believe we make employee expectations and accountability clear through our stated commitment to our “daily disciplines,” which are posted in each of our restaurants. We believe that this fosters a culture of excellence and allows us to deliver a consistent customer experience across our restaurant base.
 Our management, operations and training philosophy underscore the importance of professional and personal development for every one of our employees. Our professional development procedures include various process calendars and individual milestones which are overseen at the executive level by our Chief Quality Officer. Our restaurant-level managers are incentivized to instill a culture of excellence and drive the development of their employees. A significant component of management’s restaurant-level bonus is based on the ability to properly train and support employees. We often have dozens of managers-in-training at a given time to ensure that we have a pipeline of quality management candidates to support our new restaurants. We have complemented our training and development programs with valuable systems and tools, such as a cloud-based system to deliver proprietary training tools to our employees that also serves as a progress tracking mechanism. Our internal training system, also known as “Flame” training, creates customized progression plans for each restaurant-level employee and is available for review by all members of management. We believe that the hands-on approach we take to provide personal and professional development to every team member contributes to our ability to consistently deliver a high-quality customer experience.
 Management Information Systems
 We have invested in information systems that provide robust processing and reporting capabilities for our restaurants. All of our company-operated restaurants use MICROS, a leading computerized point-of-sale system, which we believe is scalable to support our long-term growth plans. The point-of-sale system provides a touch screen interface with an integrated kitchen display system and pagers, combined with high speed credit card and gift card processing all specifically designed for the restaurant industry. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average transaction that we actively analyze. Our enterprise-level point-of-sale system allows us to manage all products sold and their corresponding prices in every company-operated restaurant from our corporate office.
 Our in-restaurant back office systems are designed to assist in the management of our restaurants by providing quick access to sales information as well as labor and food cost management tools. The systems also provide corporate headquarters and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces restaurant managers’ time spent on administrative needs. The systems also provide sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. For company-operated restaurants, we use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly reporting on key measures for each location with final reports following the end of each period. Our restaurant managers also have the ability to submit food and operating supply orders electronically to our distribution network. Some of the additional systems that we use include a cloud-based information system, paperless employee files, proprietary on-line Flame training system and a customized labor deployment tool. All of our restaurant systems can be accessed by multi-functional hand-held tablets. Our systems and data are protected by advanced communication and data security systems.

Franchising and Licensing
 Although we expect the majority of our expansion to continue to come from company-operated restaurants, we have developed a franchising and licensing strategy that we believe will enable us to expand unit growth in selected new markets. Our franchise and license programs are low cost and high return models that allow us to expand our footprint and build brand awareness in markets that we otherwise do not plan to enter in the short to medium-term. In addition, licensed locations provide access to non-traditional locations, such as universities, airports and other captive audience venues. At the end of fiscal 2018 we had 19 franchise locations and five licensed restaurants from which we earn revenue.
 We currently have five license agreements where we typically receive an initial license fee per restaurant that is opened and we are entitled to be paid ongoing monthly royalties based on gross sales at each restaurant opened under the agreements. As of December 25, 2018, we have five licensed locations opened under these agreements, which operate in California and Arizona.
 We have an international franchise agreement for the development of restaurants in the Shanghai area. We received an initial development fee and initial franchise fees under the agreement.  Additionally, we are entitled to be paid ongoing monthly royalties based on gross sales at each restaurant that is opened under the agreement. We currently have four locations opened under this agreement.
 We have six domestic franchise agreements where we typically receive an initial franchise fee per restaurant that is opened. Additionally, we are entitled to be paid ongoing monthly royalties based on gross sales at each restaurant opened under the agreements. As of December 25, 2018, we have 15 franchised locations opened under these agreements, which operate in Nevada and Washington.
 We intend to expand the number of franchised and licensed restaurants on a disciplined basis as we develop our franchise and license program, and we have a seasoned Chief Global Business Partnership Officer to oversee our strategy to build brand awareness and drive market penetration. We have focused our franchisee and licensee development efforts on experienced, well-capitalized partners that have operating resources, local market knowledge and a capacity to build 10 or more restaurants in their respective markets.
 Marketing and Advertising
 We believe that our superior execution and high-quality food creates loyal customers who become brand ambassadors. Our focus on genuine hospitality creates a great experience for our customers, motivating them to recommend The Habit to their family and friends. We enhance sales by driving brand awareness and increasing trials by first time customers, because we believe that if we can get new consumers to experience The Habit, they will quickly become regular customers.
 Our marketing efforts, headed by our Chief Brand Officer, are centered around two main components:
  
• | Acquire New Customers. While word-of-mouth is our most effective form of marketing, we seek to increase brand awareness through several methods of promotion. We utilize social and targeted digital media such as Facebook, Twitter, Yelp and Instagram to generate buzz and promote our brand. We also promote our restaurants through local community engagement and regional and local media in markets where we have scale. We frequently partner with local organizations and participate in community events. We also use our 10 custom designed Habit Burger Grill trucks to provide event catering services and have plans to add two additional catering trucks within the next year. As of December 25, 2018, we operated 10 catering trucks in California that serve the greater Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego areas. The trucks typically handle events targeted at a minimum of 150 people. The trucks cater events throughout the week, and in many instances, will service two occasions on the same day. The catering trucks build further awareness of the Habit brand and often lead to trial by new customers. These trucks enable us to reach new consumers who may be outside our restaurant footprint by promoting new trials and extending brand awareness. We also utilize a free Charburger campaign by distributing tickets that can be used to redeem one free Charburger with cheese at any of our locations. We believe that our winning combination of word-of-mouth marketing and promotional events and

strategies deliver low cost solutions to increase trial and extend brand awareness within new and existing markets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Frequency of Existing Customers. We seek to more deeply entrench ourselves with our current customers to gain additional visits from them. We have a diverse menu that gives customers a broad variety of options from which to choose from on each visit and an ability to personalize their experience. We focus our product development efforts on select, high-quality new and limited time menu offerings to broaden our appeal to customers and further substantiate our position as a leading fast casual destination. We also use cost effective local store marketing to increase our brand’s prominence with the consumer. Additionally, we believe our employees are one of our best marketing assets. We invest time, energy and resources educating each employee about our brand and developing them into long-term brand advocates. We believe that our employees can and have become among our most enthusiastic brand ambassadors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purchasing and Distribution
 Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire high-quality ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We currently have four food distributor agreements, and we contract with them for the majority of our food and supplies. The food and supplies we purchased from our food distributors primarily consist of various proteins, such as fresh ground beef, chicken, sushi-grade tuna and USDA choice tri-tip steak. We also purchase from our food distributors beverages, paper and packaging products, produce, dairy and other grocery items, as well as a variety of kitchen and cleaning supplies needed to support our restaurant operations. We carefully selected our distributors based on their quality, understanding of our brand and ability to support our growth. We will continue to regularly evaluate all of our distributors to ensure that the products we purchase conform to our standards and that the prices they offer are competitive.
 We recognize that the safety and consistency of our products begins with our suppliers. Suppliers must meet our criteria and strict quality control standards in the production and delivery of our food and other products. We arrange for delivery of our products to each of our restaurants two to three days a week. Our standard sourcing procedures utilize two or more suppliers per distribution center for each commodity in order to reduce our supplier risk and ensure our ability to secure high-priority ingredients.
 Intellectual Property and Trademarks
 We own a number of trademarks and service marks registered or pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). We have registered several marks with the PTO, including the following: The Habit; The Habit Burger Grill; Respect the Burger; and Custom Built! Quality Food Made to Order & Design. We also have certain trademarks registered or pending in certain foreign countries. In addition, we have registered the Internet domain name www.habitburger.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report.
 We plan to license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees and licensees through franchise and license arrangements. These arrangements will restrict franchisees’ and licensees’ activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks.
 We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand, and it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our rights to such intellectual property. However, we cannot predict whether steps taken to protect such rights will be adequate. See the section entitled “Item 1A, Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Competition
 We primarily compete in the fast casual restaurant segment, but we also compete with restaurants in other segments, such as traditional fast food and casual dining. We believe the fast casual restaurant segment is competitive with these other restaurant segments with respect to food quality, price and value relationships, ambience, service and location, and is affected by many factors, including changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns, macroeconomic conditions, demographic trends, weather conditions, the cost and availability of food products and supplies, labor and government laws and regulations. We also recognize however, that both the fast food and casual dining segments have continued to significantly increase their levels of discounting.
 We believe that we have a favorable competitive stance in the fast casual restaurant segment and represent an alternative concept to traditional fast food and casual dining incumbents. Based on a guest segmentation analysis we performed in 2014, we believe our customers make their dining choices among a competitive set that includes large fast casual concepts such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Panera Bread Company and Panda Express, along with burger-focused competitors that include In-N-Out Burger, Five Guys Burger and Fries and Smashburger, among others. For additional information regarding the risks we face from competition in our segments, see “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We operate in the highly competitive restaurant industry. If we are not able to compete effectively, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 We believe that our diverse menu, including char-grilled burgers, chicken, tuna and steak featured in our sandwiches and salads, generates broad customer appeal. We believe that our restaurant design delivers a warm and inviting atmosphere, with consistently delivered genuine hospitality. We believe that our average per customer spend of $9.04 is appealing to our customers when they are choosing among fast casual restaurants. We believe that our focus on quality, environment, hospitality and value differentiate us from our competitors and provides a meaningful foundation for our continued growth.
 Seasonality
 Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically slightly lower in the fourth quarter due to holiday closures. Adverse weather conditions may also affect customer traffic, especially in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, we have outdoor seating at many of our restaurants, and the effects of adverse weather may impact the use of these areas and may negatively impact our revenue.
Employees
 As of December 25, 2018, we had 6,093 employees, including 172 field supervision/corporate personnel and 5,921 restaurant-level personnel. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation and fire prevention. We operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws, codes and regulations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular restaurant or group of restaurants.
 In addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, we, and the developers and landlords we work with, need to comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. We are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which generally 
 
9


prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.
 In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing similar matters including minimum wages, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations. See the section entitled “Item 1A, Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws can provide for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We are not aware of any environmental laws that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures relating to our restaurants. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. It is possible that we will become subject to environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the section entitled “Item 1A, Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Compliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business.”
