Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of the investigational therapy Haduvio (nalbuphine ER) to treat serious neurologically mediated conditions. We are developing Haduvio for the treatment of chronic pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis and chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. These conditions share a common pathophysiology that is mediated through opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Due to nalbuphine’s mechanism of action as a mixed agonist/antagonist of opioid receptors, we believe it has the potential to be effective in treating each of these conditions. 
 We are conducting a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of Haduvio, which we refer to as the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. The Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-arm treatment study that is designed to evaluate the safety and anti-pruritic efficacy of Haduvio in patients in the United States and Europe. In accordance with the protocol for the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, we conducted a sample size re-estimation, or SSRE, analysis in July 2020, following such time as approximately 45% of the initial targeted number of subjects in the trial were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Based on the analysis, the independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, recommended that the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial should continue and that the trial size should increase from an initial enrollment target of 240 to 360 subjects. Based on the DMC’s recommendation, we increased the trial size to 360 subjects. We completed enrollment in the trial on January 31, 2022. We expect to report top-line data in the second quarter of 2022. If the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial is successful, we expect that we will use the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we believe we will need to conduct to support the submission of a new drug application , or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and an MAA to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, or MHRA, for Haduvio for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. 
 We are also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of Haduvio for chronic cough in patients with IPF, which we refer to as the Phase 2 CANAL trial. The Phase 2 CANAL trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study that is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and dosing of Haduvio for chronic cough in patients with IPF. We are conducting this trial at multiple sites in the United Kingdom. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 60 subjects with a goal to have 44 study completers. In February 2022, we conducted an interim statistical analysis for this trial. The interim analysis (N=26) was statistically significant on the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a 52% placebo-adjusted reduction in the geometric mean percent change in daytime cough events (p<0.0001, conditional power 100%) for Haduvio. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The interim analysis was conducted by an independent statistical team according to the pre-specified endpoint in the protocol. In March 2022, we concluded enrollment early for our Phase 2 CANAL trial following the statistically significant efficacy results from the interim analysis. Because the trial achieved statistical significance in the interim analysis, sites were notified that they could enroll eligible subjects already in screening but that no additional recruitment was required. Approximately 40 subjects in total were enrolled in the study. We expect to report efficacy and safety data on the full set of subjects in the third quarter of 2022. 
 Haduvio is an oral extended-release formulation of nalbuphine. Nalbuphine is a mixed κ-opioid receptor agonist and µ-opioid receptor antagonist that has been approved and marketed as an injectable for pain indications for more than 20 years in the U.S. and Europe. The κ- and µ-opioid receptors are known to be critical mediators of itch, cough and certain movement disorders. Nalbuphine’s mechanism of action also mitigates the risk of abuse associated with µ-opioid agonists because it antagonizes, or blocks, the µ-opioid receptor. 
 Chronic pruritus, defined as itching lasting longer than six weeks, causes a number of physical and psychological issues that can substantially impact patients’ daily well-being. The urge to scratch can be unbearable and the act of scratching can remove layers of skin and break the skin barrier, leading to bleeding and scarring and increasing the risk of infection. Chronic pruritus can also lead to trouble sleeping, resulting in loss of work productivity and increased anxiety and depression as patients struggle to maintain self-control. Chronic pruritus is a hallmark of many dermatologic and systemic diseases and is the predominant reason that patients with these diseases experience so much discomfort. A recent report published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology estimated that up to 26% of the worldwide population will suffer from chronic pruritus at some point in their lives. According to the Global Pruritus Therapeutic Market Research Report issued in 2020, the market for pruritus therapeutics was $12.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to $19.9 billion in 2026. Haduvio’s dual mechanism of action targets opioid receptors located in both the central and 
 1

peripheral nervous systems, each of which plays a role in modulating the sensation of itch. We believe this makes Haduvio a promising potential therapy for the treatment of chronic pruritus. 
 We have completed clinical trials in two distinct and serious pruritic conditions, uremic pruritus and pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, with over 400 subjects treated with different doses of Haduvio in these trials. Uremic pruritus is a pruritic condition occurring in patients with chronic kidney disease typically receiving dialysis. Prurigo nodularis is an intensely pruritic dermatologic condition characterized by the presence of pruriginous lesions including nodules, papules or plaques. Among other endpoints, these trials measured the reduction in pruritus as reported on the worst itch numerical rating scale, or WI-NRS, which is a patient-reported assessment on an 11-point scale from 0 to 10 of the severity of the worst itch experienced in the last 24 hours. 
 Based on the results of our prurigo nodularis and uremic pruritus trials and open label extension trials in both indications, and discussions with the FDA and European regulatory authorities we initiated our Phase 2b/3 Pruritus Relief through Itch Scratch Modulation, or Phase 2b/3 PRISM, trial of Haduvio 162 mg tablets in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. 
 The Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial consists of two parts. The first part of the trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, two-arm, 14-week treatment period that evaluates the safety and anti-pruritic efficacy of Haduvio 162 mg tablets. The second part of the trial is an open label extension to evaluate Haduvio’s long-term safety profile as well as its effects on key prurigo nodularis parameters, including itch and skin healing, over a further 38 weeks, resulting in a 52-week overall treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial is the proportion of patients achieving at least a 4-point improvement from baseline with respect to their worst itch at week 14 as measured by WI-NRS. The trial also includes several secondary endpoints, including mean changes from baseline to week 14 in skin healing assessments and quality of life measurements, such as ItchyQoL. In designing the statistical plan for the trial, we considered the rates of patient discontinuations we experienced in our earlier trials. We believe that these discontinuation rates can be reduced through increased patient and physician education prior to the commencement of dosing. 
 The trial was designed to be conducted in 240 subjects, subject to a SSRE analysis to take place during the trial. In accordance with the protocol for the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, we conducted the SSRE analysis in July 2020, following such time as approximately 45% of the subjects in the trial were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Based on the analysis, the DMC recommended that the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial should continue and that the trial size should increase from an initial enrollment target of 240 to 360 subjects, which maintains the statistical power for the primary endpoint. Based on the DMC’s recommendation, we increased the trial size to 360 subjects. We completed enrollment in the trial on January 31, 2022. We expect to report top-line data from the 14-week blinded treatment period of the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial in the second quarter of 2022. We believe we will need to conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical trial to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA and MAAs to the EMA and MHRA. 
 As a result of nalbuphine’s ability to modulate the κ- and µ-opioid receptors, which are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of chronic cough in patients with IPF, we are conducting the Phase 2 CANAL trial of Haduvio for chronic cough in patients with IPF. The Phase 2 CANAL trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and dosing of Haduvio for chronic cough in patients with IPF. We are conducting this trial at multiple sites in the United Kingdom. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 60 subjects with a goal to have 44 study completers. In February 2022, we conducted an interim statistical analysis for this trial. The interim analysis (N=26) was statistically significant on the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a 52% placebo-adjusted reduction in the geometric mean percent change in daytime cough events (p<0.0001, conditional power 100%) for Haduvio. The interim analysis was conducted by an independent statistical team according to the pre-specified endpoint in the protocol. In March 2022, we concluded enrollment early for our Phase 2 CANAL trial following the statistically significant efficacy results from the interim analysis. Because the trial achieved statistical significance in the interim analysis, sites were notified that they could enroll eligible subjects already in screening but that no additional recruitment was required. Approximately 40 subjects in total were enrolled in the study. We expect to report efficacy and safety data on the full set of subjects in the third quarter of 2022.
 We are currently focusing our cash and operational resources on completing the Phase 2b/3 PRISM and the Phase 2 CANAL trials. After we receive top-line data from both of these trials we will evaluate additional indications for which we may choose to pursue development of Haduvio.
 Our Strategy 
 We are focused on the development and commercialization of Haduvio to treat serious neurologically mediated conditions. The key elements of our strategy are:

Nalbuphine Mechanistic Rationale 
 Nalbuphine is a mixed κ-opioid receptor agonist and µ-opioid receptor antagonist. Drugs targeting opioid receptors have been studied for decades and the biology and pharmacology of these receptors are well-understood. There are three types of opioid receptors, mu (“µ”), kappa (“κ”) and delta (“δ”), which are expressed in varying concentrations in many different tissues, including the central and peripheral nervous systems, airway and lung tissue, circulating immune and inflammatory cells and the skin. 
 Modulation of opioid receptors, either naturally or with drugs, results in multiple signaling actions at the cellular level. The receptor dynamics are complex and receptor signaling differs depending on whether the receptor is being exposed to an agonist or antagonist opioid drug. Agonists activate the receptors to which they bind, and antagonists bind to receptors, and can block the activity of agonists. In addition, opioid drugs of the same class may have different effects depending on their pharmacological properties. 
 In addition to the individual cellular dynamics, published research also supports the phenomena of network interaction dynamics, where activation of one type of opioid receptor type at one anatomical location can influence the activity of a different type of opiate receptor located at a different anatomical location. For example, published research has shown evidence of signaling between cell groups where κ-receptor activation on specific cells can antagonize µ-opioid receptor activation on other cells. As a result of these apparent network interaction dynamics between the κ- and µ-opioid receptors, we believe that simultaneously modulating both κ- and µ-opioid receptors with a single drug offers significant therapeutic potential in diseases that are mediated through these receptors. 
 Published research suggests that in certain diseases the concentration and expression of opioid receptors is different for people with the disease as compared to healthy individuals. For example, published research has shown that human skin tissue samples from patients with prurigo nodularis show a down regulation of µ-opioid receptor expression as compared to normal skin. We believe these differences in opioid receptor concentration and expression between healthy individuals and people with disease suggest that opioid drugs targeting these receptors have the potential to offer therapeutic benefit to people suffering from these diseases.

As shown in the diagram below, κ- and µ-opioid receptors are naturally concentrated in several areas of the body, including in the brain, brain stem, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, lungs and skin, which are the areas of the body involved in the physiology of chronic pruritus and chronic cough. 


With respect to pruritus, the sensation of itch and the urge to scratch are known to be mediated by κ- and µ-opioid receptor expression in the reward centers of the brain as well as the spinal cord, skin and peripheral nervous system. Published clinical trials of the κ- agonist nalfurafine have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing uremic pruritus and pruritus secondary to chronic hepatic disease. Nalfurafine is approved and marketed in Japan for both conditions. Korsuva, a selective κ- agonist, has also received approval from the FDA in reducing uremic pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In addition, a number of published clinical trials have reported on the effectiveness of the µ-antagonist naltrexone in reducing pruritus related to hepatic disease and pruritus related to prurigo nodularis. 
 With respect to cough, κ- and µ-opioid receptors in the brain stem, lungs and the peripheral lung nerves are believed to be involved in mediating respiration and the cough reflex. While there are no approved opioid therapeutics for suppression of cough in humans, µ-agonist opioids have been used clinically to suppress cough. In addition, the mixed κ-agonist and µ-partial agonist butorphanol is approved and marketed for animals in a veterinary injection and tablet formulation for the relief of chronic non-productive cough and has been found to be 15 to 20 times more active in suppressing cough than either codeine or dextromethorphan. Further, in clinical trials, nalbuphine has demonstrated suppression of cough in fentanyl-induced cough during anesthetic induction in patients. 
 Haduvio 
 Haduvio is an oral extended-release formulation of nalbuphine, a small molecule and a member of the opioid agonist-antagonist class of drugs. Nalbuphine acts as an agonist at the opioid κ-receptor while competitively antagonizing the µ-opioid receptor. Nalbuphine is a marketed drug currently available only as nalbuphine hydrochloride for injection, a generic equivalent to Nubain, which has been approved in the U.S. and Europe for use in the relief of moderate to severe pain for 
 4

more than 20 years. Nalbuphine is not currently classified as a controlled substance in the U.S. or Europe and is not commercially available in an oral dosage form. 
 We have leveraged the known mechanism and proven biological activity of nalbuphine in pain to expedite the clinical development of Haduvio. We have also drawn on the safety and tolerability data from eight prior clinical trials of Haduvio conducted by Penwest, from which we have licensed rights from Endo (which acquired Penwest) to Haduvio, including two Phase 2 clinical trials of Haduvio for the treatment of pain, to support our clinical development efforts. We believe that the established efficacy and safety profile of nalbuphine and the clinical experience with Haduvio provide a strong foundation for advancing Haduvio in late-stage clinical trials. 
 Our Haduvio Development Programs 
 Active Chronic Pruritus Programs 
 We are developing Haduvio for the treatment of chronic pruritus associated with various conditions. We have filed an IND with the FDA covering Haduvio in pruritus in prurigo nodularis and uremic pruritus. We have completed two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe uremic pruritus and moderate to severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis that have established proof of concept in these indications. We believe that the pruritus associated with multiple distinct conditions, including prurigo nodularis and uremic pruritus, involves activation of a common neuronal pathway for itch signaling. 
 Chronic pruritus, defined as itching lasting longer than six weeks, causes a number of physical and psychological issues that can substantially impact patients’ daily well-being. The urge to scratch can be unbearable, and the act of scratching can remove layers of skin and break the skin barrier leading to bleeding, scarring and greatly increasing the risk of infection. Chronic pruritus can also lead to trouble sleeping, resulting in loss of work productivity and increased anxiety and depression as patients struggle to maintain self-control. Chronic pruritus is a hallmark of many dermatologic and systemic diseases and is the predominant reason that patients with these diseases experience so much discomfort. A recent report published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology estimated that up to 26% of the worldwide population will suffer from chronic pruritus at some point in their lives. 
 Despite its prevalence, chronic pruritus is not well addressed by current treatment options. Pruritic skin diseases are commonly treated with a multi-prong therapeutic approach. Skin barrier restoration and maintenance through application of topical moisturizers and treatment of skin lesions locally through the use of topical corticosteroids or other topical anti-inflammatory agents are the predominant first-line therapies for many pruritic skin diseases. Phototherapy and systemic immunomodulators, including biologics, are frequently used for more severe disease conditions. These treatment options may reduce pruritus to some degree in addition to their effects on skin health and inflammation. Yet many patients with chronic pruritus still report high levels of pruritus despite active topical or systemic therapy. This significant medical need is reflected by the widespread use of therapies intended to address pruritus specifically, such as oral antihistamines, despite evidence demonstrating their relative lack of efficacy, as well as concerns regarding their safety and tolerability. According to the Global Pruritus Therapeutic Market Research Report issued in 2020, the market for pruritus therapeutics was $12.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to $19.9 billion in 2026.

Prurigo Nodularis Program 
 Overview 
 Prurigo nodularis is an intensely pruritic dermatologic condition that constitutes a distinct dermatologic diagnosis. The core symptoms and criteria for diagnosis of prurigo nodularis are chronic pruritus, a history and/or signs of repeated scratching, and the presence of multiple pruriginous lesions. The presence and persistence of these pruriginous lesions are hallmarks of prurigo nodularis and aid in its diagnosis. These lesions are generally symmetrically distributed, intensely itchy papules, nodules or plaques, which may be associated with excoriations and ulcerations. As illustrated below, prurigo nodularis can arise from itch caused by a number of pre-existing conditions, with the initial scratching beginning a vicious itch-scratch cycle that results in the nodules that are characteristic of the distinct and separate disease of prurigo nodularis. 
 

The pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis is generally considered to be one of the most severe and treatment-resistant forms of pruritus. In a retrospective study of 108 prurigo nodularis patients published in 2013 in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, patients rating their most severe itch over the prior 24 hours on the WI-NRS reported a median WI-NRS score of 8 and a mean and median duration of prurigo nodularis of 77.5 and 36 months, respectively. As illustrated in the diagram below, the WI-NRS is a patient-reported assessment on an 11-point scale from 0 to 10 of the severity of the worst itch experienced in the last 24 hours, and scores of 7 or more are considered to indicate severe itch. 
 

Patients with prurigo nodularis also typically experience a significant negative impact on their overall quality of life, including severe negative impacts on their confidence at work and in social activities. In a natural history study in 593 patients with prurigo nodularis at the Itch Center, University of Münster in Germany, it was shown that all of the patients in the study had a severe impairment of quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index, or DLQI, a specific validated quality-of-life measurement that has been used in many different skin condition trials. With increasing intensity of pruritus, the quality of life worsened and DLQI values increased. 
 We believe there are approximately 300,000 prurigo nodularis patients in the U.S. and approximately 430,000 additional prurigo nodularis patients outside the U.S. No treatment for chronic pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis 
 6

has been approved in the U.S. or Europe. Treatment of prurigo nodularis typically involves a multifaceted approach to treat the lesions and reduce pruritus. Therapies may include corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory treatments, phototherapy and drugs such as gabapentin and Lyrica (pregabalin), prescription medicines approved for the treatment of seizures and neuropathic pain. Prurigo nodularis is often treatment-resistant with high recurrence rates. 
 Clinical Development 
 We have conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial and an open label extension study of Haduvio in pruritus in patients with prurigo nodularis and are currently conducting our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial for Haduvio for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. If successful, we expect that we will use the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we believe we will need to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA. 
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial
We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in August 2016 evaluating the safety and efficacy of Haduvio as compared to placebo in patients with pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial conducted at eight sites in the U.S. and Europe. The trial enrolled a total of 63 adult patients who had prurigo nodularis for at least six weeks and seven-day mean WI-NRS scores of at least 5, indicating moderate to severe pruritus. The patients were randomized across three treatment arms: either 162 mg or 81 mg of Haduvio or placebo, each administered twice daily. The baseline seven-day mean WI-NRS scores for the three treatment arms were comparable: 8.05 for the 162 mg arm, 8.46 for the 81 mg arm and 7.96 for the placebo arm. There were three dosing periods in the trial, all of which were blinded: an initial two-week titration period during which patients received gradually increasing doses of Haduvio or placebo, reaching the final assigned dose on day 15; an eight-week fixed dosing period; and a two-week off-treatment safety observation period. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients reporting at least a 30% reduction from baseline to week 10 in seven-day mean WI-NRS scores. We refer to these patients as 30% responders. Key secondary endpoints included: 
  
• | mean change in seven-day mean WI-NRS scores from baseline to week 10;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proportion of patients reporting at least a 50% reduction in seven-day mean WI-NRS score from baseline to week 10, whom we refer to as 50% responders, which reduction was comparable to a 4-point reduction in WI-NRS score, the primary efficacy endpoint for our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, for patients in the 162 mg arm due to such patients having a mean baseline WI-NRS score of 8.05; and

• | mean change from baseline to week 10 in total ItchyQoL score, a 22-question assessment using a severity scale of 1 to 5 that measures how pruritus affects patients’ quality of life based on symptoms related to the pruritic condition, their functional limitations, their emotions and observations about their skin disease.

Efficacy Results 
 The following table summarizes the outcomes of the trial at week 10 for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. The table below also includes results from a post hoc analysis of the 50 patients who completed the 10-week course of treatment, who we refer to as completers. We believe this post hoc analysis provides informative data as it eliminates the effects of patient discontinuations. With the small number of patients enrolled in the trial, the number of patients discontinuing treatment prior to the end of the trial had a substantial impact on the results, even though the number of discontinuations was small in absolute terms. Approximately 75% of the discontinuations in the Haduvio arms occurred in the titration period among patients who had not reached the target dose of Haduvio. During the trial, the discontinuation rate declined as enrollment progressed, which we believe was due to trial sites and investigators gaining experience with Haduvio and the trial. We believe that these discontinuation rates can be reduced in future trials through increased patient and physician education prior to the commencement of dosing as the adverse events leading to these discontinuations were mild in nature and transient.

 In the trial, a significantly greater number of patients reported improvement in WI-NRS with 50% of the completers in the 162 mg arm reported at least a 50% reduction in WI-NRS score from baseline, as compared to 20% of the completers in the placebo arm (p=0.028), although this analysis was not powered for statistical significance. Importantly, the patients in the 162 mg arm had a mean baseline WI-NRS score of 8.05; therefore a 50% reduction in WI-NRS score from baseline for patients in this arm was comparable to a 4-point reduction in WI-NRS score, the primary efficacy endpoint of our ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial. While the primary endpoint of the trial demonstrated a numerical but not statistically significant difference in the 162 mg arm, we believe the results for the key secondary endpoint of the proportion of patients reporting at least a 50% reduction in WI-NRS score from baseline, and the post hoc analysis, allow us to better understand the response of patients with prurigo nodularis to Haduvio and indicate that responders to Haduvio took the higher dose (162 mg) for longer (completers) and had a greater reduction in WI-NRS.

Safety Results 
 Haduvio was well tolerated in the trial. No serious adverse events, or SAEs, were assessed as definitely, probably or possibly related to Haduvio. Two patients experienced SAEs that were assessed as unlikely to be related to Haduvio, including one patient in the Haduvio 81 mg arm of the trial whose SAEs occurred in connection with a car accident and one patient in the placebo arm with acute myeloid leukemia by bone marrow who experienced leukocytosis. The majority of treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, occurred during the titration period. During the titration period, 73% of Haduvio-treated patients experienced one or more adverse events, as compared to 46% of patients receiving placebo. 
 The following table summarizes the most common TEAEs experienced by patients in the trial, indicating the percentage of the modified intention to treat, or mITT, population of each arm that reported each such TEAE, subdivided by the grade of the reported TEAEs. Grade refers to the severity of the TEAE, with grade 1 TEAEs generally including mild or asymptomatic conditions or clinical or diagnostic observations only, grade 2 TEAEs generally including moderate events or minimal, local or noninvasive intervention events and grade 3 TEAEs generally including severe or medically significant events that are not immediately life-threatening, events requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or disabling events. There were no grade 4 or grade 5 TEAEs reported in the trial, which would generally include life-threatening or urgent intervention events and deaths. Patients were able to report multiple TEAEs and, as a result, the percentages specified below for each arm or grade do not necessarily represent the percentage of patients in the arm that experienced any TEAE or any grade of any TEAE.

Open Label Extension Study
We completed a one-year open label extension study of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with prurigo nodularis in July 2017. Patients who completed the Phase 2 clinical trial were able to enroll in the extension study following a safety washout period. Patients who enrolled in the extension study who had WI-NRS scores of at least 5 were immediately admitted to the active treatment period of the study. Patients with WI-NRS scores of less than 5 entered an observation period for up to 12 weeks. Patients in this observation period began to receive active treatment only following their first reported WI-NRS score of at least 5, or if they reached the end of the 12-week observation period and their WI-NRS scores remained below 5, they were required to leave the study. 
 Patients in the active treatment period received Haduvio at a dose determined by self-titration (both up and down) to tolerance, ranging from 27 mg, once daily, up to 162 mg, twice daily, for up to 50 weeks. The variable-length observation period resulted in an active treatment period that could range from 38 to 50 weeks, depending on when the patient moved from the observation period to the active treatment period. The open label extension study enrolled 41 patients and of these 36 were admitted to the active treatment period. Of the patients admitted to the active treatment period, 20 patients completed at least 26 weeks of treatment and 16 patients completed 50 weeks of treatment, which are periods that correspond to guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use to assess safety over periods of approximately six months and one year. 
 We observed mean changes in WI-NRS score from commencement of the active treatment period to week 26 and week 50 of -3.9 and -4.2, respectively, and a mean change in total ItchyQoL score from commencement of the active treatment period to week 26 and week 50 of -16.0 and -12.5, respectively. In the Verbal Rating Scale, a patient self-assessment of the presence and intensity of three distinct skin sensations (itching, burning and stinging) on a 5-category numeric assessment scale ranging from 0 to 4, over half of the patients reported at least a 1-category improvement from commencement of the active treatment period to their last observed study visit. In addition, we observed improvement at weeks 26 and 50 with respect to pruriginous lesions observed in Prurigo Activity Score, or PAS, assessments, which include physician assessments of skin lesions on a 0% to 100% scale, divided into five categories of 20% each, with respect to each of two parameters: percentage of excoriations/crusting and percentage of healed lesions. For the subsets of patients who completed 26 or 50 weeks of treatment and who had a PAS exam reported at both baseline and week 26 or 50, 13 of 19 patients at week 26, and 9 of 15 patients at week 50, showed at a least a 1-category improvement in excoriations/crusts; and 11 of 19 patients at week 26, and 7 of 15 patients at week 50, showed at least a 1-category improvement in healed 
 9

lesions. We believe these data suggest that with continued longer-term treatment, both ongoing reduction in pruritus and improvement in the pruriginous lesions themselves may be observed in a meaningful proportion of patients. 
 Haduvio was well-tolerated in the open label extension study. The most frequent adverse events related to study drug were nausea and dizziness, which were reported in seven patients (19%) each, and fatigue, which was reported in six patients (17%). There were no treatment emergent SAEs reported that were considered related to study drug and the majority of adverse events were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. There were no deaths reported in the study. 
 Ongoing Phase 2b/3 PRISM Clinical Trial 
 Following completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial described above, we met with the FDA and European regulatory authorities to discuss the registration pathway for Haduvio for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis and the design of our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, including the target population, dose, duration and primary efficacy endpoint. Based on these discussions and the results of our prurigo nodularis and uremic pruritus trials we initiated our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial of Haduvio 162 mg tablets in subjects with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. 
 The Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial consists of two parts. The first part of the trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, two-arm, 14-week treatment period that is evaluating the safety and anti-pruritic efficacy of Haduvio 162 mg tablets. The second part of the trial is an open label extension to evaluate Haduvio’s long-term safety profile as well as its effects on key prurigo nodularis parameters, including itch and skin healing, over a further 38 weeks, resulting in a 52-week overall treatment period. 
 Patients will be dosed over two periods in the blinded portion of the trial: an initial two-week titration period during which patients receive gradually increasing doses of Haduvio or placebo, reaching the final assigned dose on day 15, followed by a 12-week fixed-dosing period. Following the initial 14-week treatment period, patients will continue into another two-week blinded titration period during which patients from the placebo arm will cross over to active drug with a standard escalating titration schedule, while patients from the Haduvio arm remain at a stable dose of 162 mg twice daily. This blinded two-week period will be followed by 36 weeks of stable dosing at 162 mg twice daily of open label Haduvio for all participants. The open label extension will conclude with a final two-week off-treatment washout and safety observation period for all patients. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial is the proportion of patients achieving at least a 4-point improvement from baseline with respect to their worst itch at week 14 as measured by WI-NRS. Key secondary endpoints include the mean changes from baseline to week 14 in WI-NRS and ItchyQoL scores and the difference in percentage of patients having a 1-category improvement in the percentage of pruriginous lesions with excoriations or crusts on the PAS at week 14. 
 Eligible patients for this trial are adults with prurigo nodularis, defined by having at least ten pruriginous nodules, with predominantly nodular lesions overall, over at least two anatomically distinct body areas, with baseline seven-day mean WI-NRS scores of at least 7, indicating severe pruritus. The trial was designed to be conducted in 240 subjects, subject to a sample size re-estimation, or SSRE, analysis to take place during the trial. In accordance with the protocol for the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, we conducted the SSRE analysis in July 2020, following such time as approximately 45% of the patients in the trial were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Based on the analysis, the DMC recommended that the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial should continue and that the trial size should increase from an initial enrollment target of 240 to 360 subjects, which maintains the statistical power for the primary endpoint. Based on the DMC’s recommendation, we increased the planned trial size to 360 subjects. We completed enrollment in the trial on January 31, 2022. We expect to report top-line data in the second quarter of 2022. If the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial is successful, we expect that we will use the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we believe we will need to conduct to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Haduvio for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis.
 Next Steps 
 If the results of the Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial and the additional Phase 3 clinical trial that we believe we need to conduct are positive, and the data from the other required supportive trials are also favorable, we would plan to seek approval for Haduvio for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis by submitting to the FDA a Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, which would rely on the FDA’s previous findings for the safety and effectiveness of nalbuphine, in addition to the data we generate regarding Haduvio. 
 We have also obtained scientific guidance from regulatory authorities in two European countries, Sweden and Germany with respect to regulatory paths supporting submission of an MAA for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. We have had initial discussions of a Pediatric Investigational Plan with European health authorities. 
 Chronic Cough in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Program 
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, is a rare, chronic, progressive lung disease, characterized by scarring and thickening of lung tissue leading to an irreversible loss of lung function and reduced life expectancy. Most patients diagnosed with IPF suffer from a dry, non-productive chronic cough that interrupts their daily living and significantly contributes to poor quality of life. Chronic coughing can have a debilitating physical and psychosocial burden, exacerbate 
 10

concomitant respiratory disease, cause loss of sleep and reduce mobility. Cough is an independent predictor of disease progression in IPF, and therefore we believe cough may contribute to the progression of the underlying disease. 
 Approximately 130,000 adults in the U.S. and greater than 1 million adults worldwide are believed to have IPF. In addition, up to 85% of IPF patients are reported to suffer from chronic cough. These patients can cough over 50 times per hour, which can lead to other morbidities. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough in patients suffering with IPF. 
 The opioid class of drugs has demonstrated the ability to suppress cough and is used in the clinical management of cough. There is also preclinical and clinical evidence that mixed agonist-antagonist drugs can also be effective in treating cough. We believe Haduvio has the potential to be an effective treatment for chronic cough in patients with IPF. 
 The Phase 2 CANAL trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and dosing of Haduvio for chronic cough in patients with IPF. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 60 subjects with a goal to have 44 study completers. We are conducting the trial at multiple sites in the United Kingdom. In February 2022, we conducted an interim statistical analysis for this trial on the 26 subjects who had completed at least one treatment period one as of the January 28, 2022 data cut-off. The interim analysis was statistically significant on the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a 52% placebo-adjusted reduction in the geometric mean percent change in daytime cough events (p<0.0001, conditional power 100%) for Haduvio. The interim analysis was conducted by an independent statistical team according to the pre-specified endpoint in the protocol. In March 2022, we concluded enrollment early for our Phase 2 CANAL trial following the statistically significant efficacy results from the interim analysis. Because the trial achieved statistical significance in the interim analysis, sites were notified that they could enroll eligible subjects already in screening but that no additional recruitment was required. Approximately 40 subjects in total were enrolled in the study. We expect to report efficacy and safety data on the full set of subjects in the third quarter of 2022.
 Patients were randomized into one of two treatment arms. The patients in the first treatment arm received Haduvio for three weeks, which period was followed by a two-week washout period and then a three-week treatment period during which they received placebo. The patients in the second treatment arm received placebo during the first three-week treatment period, followed by a two-week washout period, then received Haduvio during the second three-week treatment period. During the active treatment periods, Haduvio was studied over a dosing range starting at 27 mg once daily and titrated in steps to 162 mg twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is mean percent change in daytime cough frequency as measured by a cough monitor as compared in the Haduvio treatment periods and the placebo treatment periods. Secondary endpoints in the trial include assessments of fatigue, dyspnea or shortness of breath and cough severity. The interim trial results were:

CANAL Supplemental Efficacy Analyses:
 The supplemental efficacy analyses from the CANAL interim data support the strong results seen in the primary efficacy endpoint. The supplemental analyses showed consistency when analyzed for completers of both treatment periods in the crossover design, against treatment period baseline, and baseline cough counts. Secondary endpoints of patient reported outcome measure changes were consistent with the improvement in daytime-cough frequency results.

 Full Analysis Set includes subjects completing at least 1 treatment period. Completers include subjects completing both treatment periods.
 Safety and Tolerability Results:
 Nalbuphine ER has been well-tolerated in the CANAL trial and has been studied in more than 1,000 subjects across various indications. The safety profile remains consistent with prior studies with no new safety signals to date. One SAE has been reported in the CANAL trial to date and was not considered to be treatment related.
Next Steps:
 In March 2022, we concluded enrollment early for our Phase 2 CANAL trial, following the statistically significant efficacy results from the interim analysis. Because the trial achieved statistical significance in the interim analysis, sites were notified that they could enroll eligible subjects already in screening but that no additional recruitment was required. Approximately 40 subjects in total were enrolled in the study. We expect to report efficacy and safety data on the full set of subjects in the third quarter of 2022. We will also begin planning the next trial for Haduvio for the treatment of chronic cough associated with IPF, which we intend to design as a Phase 2b/3 trial
 Uremic Pruritus Program 
 Overview 
 Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus, also known as uremic pruritus, can occur in patients with chronic kidney disease and is most often seen in patients receiving hemodialysis. Uremic pruritus is one of the most common conditions affecting end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, patients undergoing hemodialysis. Studies report that itchy and dry skin, symptoms of pruritus, affect 40% to 90% of ESRD patients. Yet, in clinical practice the condition is often underdiagnosed resulting in inadequate management and an underappreciated impact on patient outcomes. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, or DOPPS, in 2017 demonstrated that 70% of hemodialysis patients experienced some pruritus, with 42% reporting moderate to extreme pruritus. The DOPPS started in 1996 and has tracked over 120,000 patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and with chronic kidney disease over 20 countries. 
 We estimate that there are more than 650,000 patients in the U.S. and approximately 2 million patients worldwide who are affected by ESRD and that, among these patients, approximately 260,000 patients in the U.S. and 800,000 patients worldwide suffer from pruritus. 
 Korsuva has been approved in the U.S. and nalfurafine (marketed as Remitch) is approved in Japan for uremic pruritus. There have been no treatments approved for uremic pruritus in Europe. Treatment of uremic pruritus may include optimizing dialysis procedures as well as off-label treatments such as corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive or anti-
 12

inflammatory treatments, phototherapy and drugs such as gabapentin and Lyrica (pregabalin), prescription medicines approved for the treatment of seizures and neuropathic pain. 
 Clinical Development 
 We have conducted three clinical trials of Haduvio in patients with uremic pruritus, including a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in 373 patients with moderate to severe uremic pruritus, an open label extension of the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and a Phase 1b clinical trial in 14 hemodialysis patients with uremic pruritus and eight healthy subjects. 
 Phase 2b/3 Clinical Trial
We completed a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in June 2015 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Haduvio versus placebo in patients with uremic pruritus. The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 41 sites in the U.S. and Europe. The trial enrolled a total of 373 adult patients who had uremic pruritus, had been receiving in-center hemodialysis for at least three months, were on a schedule of three dialysis visits per week and had mean WI-NRS scores of at least 4.5 (indicating moderate to severe pruritus) over their last three dialysis visits. The patients were randomized across three treatment arms: either 108 mg or 54 mg of Haduvio or placebo, each administered twice daily. The baseline mean WI-NRS scores for the three treatment arms were comparable: 6.94 for the 108 mg arm, 6.87 for the 54 mg arm and 6.75 for the placebo arm. There were three dosing periods in the trial, all of which were blinded: an initial two-week titration period during which patients received gradually increasing doses of Haduvio or placebo, reaching the final assigned dose on day 15; a six-week fixed-dosing period; and a two-week off-treatment safety observation period. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial was the mean change in WI-NRS score at baseline to WI-NRS score over the last two weeks of the fixed-dosing period (weeks seven and eight), which we refer to as the Evaluation Period. Key secondary endpoint analyses included the following: 
  
• | change from baseline to the Evaluation Period in total Skindex-10 score, which is a questionnaire-based score assessing quality of life across 10 questions, grouped into three categories, or domains, with three questions relating to disease symptoms, three questions relating to mood and emotional distress and four questions relating to effects on social functioning; and

• | change from baseline to the Evaluation Period in Itch Medical Outcomes Study, or IMOS, Sleep Scale score, which is a questionnaire-based score developed for hemodialysis patients assessing overall quality of sleep.

Efficacy Results 
 The following table summarizes the outcomes of the trial for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. The table below also includes results from a post hoc analysis of change from baseline to the Evaluation Period in score for only the disease domain questions of the Skindex-10 assessment and a post hoc analysis of the subset of patients who entered the trial with severe itch, defined as a baseline WI-NRS score of at least 7, which we believe is notable as it shows a greater response in patients with more severe itch.

Safety Results 
 The overall profile of the safety observations in the trial reflected the high rates of concomitant disease in the patient population, which is common for patients suffering from chronic renal failure. At baseline, the patient population had the following rates of serious concomitant diseases: hypertension, 98%; dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia, 58%; diabetes, 52%; congestive heart failure, 29%; peripheral neuropathy, 28%; history of supraventricular tachycardia, 16%; history of peripheral vascular disease, 14%; history of prior myocardial infarction, 12%; and history of prior stroke, 10%. 
 In this trial, SAEs were frequent but were primarily related to the serious concomitant diseases associated with patients on hemodialysis or to procedural complications related to hemodialysis. During the trial, one patient on placebo died from sepsis; no other deaths occurred. Overall, 43 patients experienced at least one SAE during the eight weeks of trial dosing. Of the SAEs reported, a case of grade 3 vertigo was the only SAE considered related to study drug. The most common SAEs that were considered unrelated to study drug included congestive cardiac failure, non-cardiac chest pain, fluid overload, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hypotension. TEAEs occurred in 73%, 75% and 61% of the patients in the 108 mg, 54 mg and placebo arms, respectively. The higher rates of TEAEs in the Haduvio arms as compared to placebo appeared to be primarily attributable to higher rates of TEAEs in the Haduvio arms during the initial two-week titration period. During the titration period, 55% of Haduvio-treated patients experienced TEAEs, as compared to 28% of patients receiving placebo. During the eight-week fixed-dosing period, 37% of Haduvio-treated patients experienced TEAEs, as compared to 42% of patients receiving placebo. 
 The following table summarizes the most common TEAEs experienced by patients in each of the two weeks of the titration period, as well as in the fixed-dosing period, indicating the percentage of the mITT population of each arm that reported each such TEAE.

While we believe that this trial established proof of concept for Haduvio in the treatment of pruritus, we are not actively developing Haduvio for uremic pruritus at this time based on our evaluation of the market dynamics, but may consider resuming development in the future.

Open Label Extension Study
We completed a six-month (24-week) open label extension study of our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in patients with uremic pruritus in November 2015. Patients who completed the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial were able to enroll in the extension study following a safety washout period. Patients who enrolled in the extension study who had WI-NRS scores of greater than 2 were immediately admitted to the active treatment period of the study. Patients with WI-NRS scores of 2 or less entered an observation period for up to 12 weeks. Patients in this observation period began to receive active treatment only following their first WI-NRS score that was greater than 2; if they reached the end of the 12-week observation period and their WI-NRS scores remained at or below 2, they were required to leave the study. 
 Patients in the active treatment period received Haduvio with an initial titration over three weeks according to the evolution of their itch response, at doses ranging from 27 mg, once daily, up to a maximum dose of 108 mg, twice daily, followed by up to 21 additional weeks of treatment. The variable-length observation period resulted in an active treatment period that could range from 12 to 24 weeks (including the initial titration period), depending on when the patient moved from the observation period to the active treatment period. After the initial titration period, patients were permitted one down-titration, and if their itch increased with the reduced dose, they could then return to their initial fixed dose in the study. The open label extension study enrolled 184 patients. Of these, 167 were admitted to the active treatment cohort and 51 of these patients had WI-NRS scores of at least 7, indicative of severe itch, a group we refer to as the severe itch population. Of the patients admitted to the active treatment cohort, 101 completed the open label extension study, including 31 of the patients in the severe itch population. 
 The patients admitted to the active treatment cohort had a mean baseline WI-NRS score of 5.59 (recorded in 166 of the 167 patients admitted) and the mean WI-NRS score at week 24 of the patients who completed the study was 2.78, amounting to a reduction of 2.70. The severe itch population had a mean baseline WI-NRS score of 8.27 and the mean WI-NRS score at week 24 of the patients in the severe itch population who completed the study was 3.48, amounting to a reduction of 4.73. 
 The patients admitted to the active treatment cohort had a mean baseline total Skindex-10 score of 27.63 (recorded in 166 of the 167 patients admitted) and the mean total Skindex-10 score at week 24 of the patients who completed the study was 16.61, amounting to a reduction of 10.56. The severe itch population had a mean baseline total Skindex-10 score of 40.29 and the mean total Skindex-10 score at week 24 of the patients in the severe itch population who completed the study was 18.58, amounting to a reduction of 19.97. 
 The patients admitted to the active treatment cohort had a mean baseline IMOS Sleep Scale score of 48.50 (recorded in 165 of the 167 patients admitted) and the mean IMOS Sleep Scale score at week 24 of the patients who completed the study was 38.54, amounting to a reduction of 8.75. The severe itch population had a mean Sleep Scale score at week 24 of the patients in the severe itch population who completed the study was 43.47, amounting to a reduction of 18.42. 
 We also assessed changes from baseline to week 24 in mean score for the depression-related questions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, or HADS, which is a questionnaire-based 4-category numeric assessment scale ranging from 0 to 3 over 14 questions, with seven questions relating to anxiety and seven questions relating to depression. The patients admitted to the active treatment cohort had a mean baseline HADS depression subscale score of 6.03 (recorded in 165 of the 167 patients admitted) and the mean HADS depression subscale score at week 24 of the patients who completed the study was 4.78, amounting to a reduction of 1.15. The severe itch population had a mean baseline HADS depression subscale score of 6.80 and the mean HADS depression subscale score at week 24 of the patients in the severe itch population who completed the study was 4.77, amounting to a reduction of 1.71. 
 Safety observations in the extension study reflected the underlying severity of illness in the patients in the study, all of whom were on hemodialysis. Four deaths occurred during the study among the 184 enrolled patients. The primary causes of death in these four patients were: cardiac arrest, sudden death, myocardial infarction and hypertensive emergency and massive cerebral hemorrhage in the basal ganglia. The overall mortality rate, and incidence of cardiac deaths specifically, observed in the trial was consistent with the normal rates for this patient population. Among the 54 patients who reported one or more SAEs, three patients reported SAEs that were considered possibly related to study drug: one case of grade 2 gastritis that occurred in association with systemic inflammatory response syndrome; one case of grade 2 constipation that occurred in the setting of associated fluid overload; and one case of grade 2 headache that occurred in the setting of grade 2 hypotension. None of these patients died. Of the adverse effects that are commonly associated with the opiate drug class use (vertigo, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence and sedation), only nausea (occurring in 25.7% of patients) and vomiting (occurring in 19.8% of patients), occurred in greater than 10% of patients. 
 Other Ongoing Development Work 
 Hepatic Impairment Study
 We conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic liver disease to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of Haduvio in this population. This trial was designed as an open label, non-randomized, parallel-group, single and multiple ascending dose pharmacokinetic trial in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment. We completed the single ascending dosing portion of this trial in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment and there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial. After reviewing the safety and PK data generated in the single ascending dose portion of the trial, we believe that these data are sufficient to support further 
 15

investigation of Haduvio in potential future safety and efficacy studies in patients with relevant liver diseases without the need to conduct the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial. We intend to use the data from the hepatic impairment study to support an NDA submission for Haduvio.
 We plan to conduct a human abuse liability study to further characterize the abuse potential of nalbuphine. We also anticipate conducting additional standard pharmacokinetics studies required for any NDA submission including studies in specific populations, cardiovascular safety, food effect and dose proportionality studies, and other studies as needed to support marketing applications for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we are able to successfully develop and commercialize Haduvio, it would compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Chronic Pruritus 
 We are developing Haduvio for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. Currently, there are no products approved in the U.S. or Europe for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, however there are many products that are used to help manage pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis with which we expect that Haduvio would compete if it is approved in this indication. If Haduvio is approved for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, we expect that it would compete with a number of therapeutics that are used off-label to treat prurigo nodularis, including anti-itch creams and emollients as well as oral or injectable antihistamines. All of these products have limited degrees of efficacy and are available generically. Additionally, patients may try several other agents such as Dupixent (dupilumab), which is an injectable prescription medicine approved for atopic dermatitis that is in clinical development for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. Sanofi reported positive data from two Phase 3 trials of Dupixent for the treatment of prurigo nodularis and that it plans regulatory submissions around the world for this indication in 2022. Patients may also try gabapentin and Lyrica (pregabalin), which are prescription medicines approved for the treatment of seizures and neuropathic pain, naltrexone and UVB light therapy, generally with limited success. We also expect that Haduvio might compete with product candidates currently in clinical development in this indication, including nemolizumab, an anti-interleukin-31 receptor, a humanized monoclonal antibody being developed by Galderma; KPL-716, a monoclonal antibody targeting oncostatin M receptor beta being developed by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals; abrocitinib, an oral small molecule targeting the janus kinase (JAK) 1 receptor being developed by Pfizer Inc.; INCB054707, an oral small molecule targeting the JAK 1 receptor being developed by Incyte; and CDX-0159, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the KIT receptor being developed by Celldex Therapeutics. In addition, a number of other product candidates are currently in clinical development to treat other pruritic conditions and Haduvio, if approved for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis could face competition from these product candidates.
Chronic Cough in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
 If Haduvio is approved for the treatment of chronic cough associated with IPF, we expect that it may compete with product candidates currently in clinical development for the treatment of chronic cough associated with IPF, such as orvepitant, which is being developed in a Phase 2b clinical trial by Nerre Therapeutics, and ifenprodil which is being developed in a Phase 2 clinical trial by Algernon Pharmaceuticals. We expect that it might also compete with other product candidates currently in development or submitted for approval to the FDA for the treatment of chronic refractory cough and unexplained chronic cough by companies including Merck, Shionogi, and Bellus Health. In addition, it is possible that product candidates currently in development for the treatment of IPF could, if approved, reduce the need for therapies to treat chronic cough associated with IPF.
 Many of our competitors and potential competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and commercializing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials.
 We expect that Haduvio, if approved for marketing, will compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, health-economic benefit, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than 
 16

Haduvio. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for Haduvio, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 License Agreements 
 Exclusive License Agreement with Endo Pharmaceuticals 
 In May 2011, we entered into an agreement with Penwest (subsequently merged into its parent, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Endo) for an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by Penwest to develop and commercialize products incorporating nalbuphine hydrochloride in any formulation, including an extended-release formulation such as Haduvio, in all fields and for any use. 
 Under the license agreement, we paid Penwest a minimal, non-creditable, non-refundable upfront license fee. We may also become obligated to make milestone payments to Endo of $0.3 million, which would become due upon the successful completion of the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a licensed product candidate, such as our Phase 2b/3 PRISM trial, and $0.8 million, which would become due upon the marketing approval of a licensed product in the United States, and to pay mid-single-digit royalties based on net sales of the licensed products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees. In addition, we are obligated to pay Endo a low-to-mid double-digit percentage of certain income we receive from sublicensees, based on the date of the definitive agreement under which the sublicense was granted. 
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in each country commences upon the first commercial sale of the product in that country and extends until the later of the expiration, unenforceability or invalidation of the last valid claim of any licensed patent or application covering the licensed product in the country or the expiration of 10 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country, which period is referred to as the royalty term. Upon the expiration of the royalty term for a product in a country, we are thereafter obligated to pay a low single-digit know-how and trademark royalty. 
 Under the agreement, we have granted Endo a non-exclusive, royalty-free (except for pass-through payments to third parties), sublicenseable license under our relevant patent rights, to use any improvement we make to Endo’s controlled release technology, for any product other than the products under which we are licensed by Endo. 
 Both we and Endo have the right to terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within specified cure periods. Endo also has the right to terminate in the event we undergo specified bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation events, and we have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience at any time on 180 days’ notice to Endo. Additionally, if we or any of our sublicensees challenge the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent rights covering a licensed product, and that challenge is not terminated within a specified period, the agreement will immediately terminate and all licenses granted under the agreement will be revoked. 
 Upon termination of the agreement, we must transfer to Endo all regulatory filings and approvals relating to the development, manufacture or commercialization of the licensed products and all trademarks, other than our corporate trademarks, then being used in connection with the licensed products. If the agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be deemed to have granted Endo a perpetual, royalty-free (except for pass-through payments to third parties), worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license, under any improvements we made to the licensed know-how, and any related patent rights we have, to manufacture and commercialize the licensed products. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties for the supply of nalbuphine hydrochloride drug substance and the manufacture of Haduvio tablets for clinical trials and intend to do so for clinical and commercial supply in the future. We do not own or operate facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of drug substance or drug product. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with experience to oversee our relationships with contract manufacturers. 
 Haduvio is manufactured from readily available starting materials using established, scalable processes that do not require any special equipment or technology. Nalbuphine hydrochloride drug substance is commercially available and manufactured at production scale. Haduvio tablets are currently manufactured at a scale sufficient for use in clinical trials. Process development work is also being planned. 
 We believe that our current suppliers and manufacturers have the capacity to support commercial scale production of Haduvio, however we have no formal agreements with them to cover commercial production and we may seek to pursue supply or manufacturing arrangements with additional or alternative parties in the future. While we believe there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical requirements and any future commercial requirements, replacing or adding a supplier or manufacturer could result in additional cost or delay. 
 17

Commercial Operations 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a marketing and sales organization. We have retained worldwide development and commercial rights for Haduvio. If Haduvio is approved by the FDA for any of our target indications, we intend to market and commercialize Haduvio in the U.S. by developing our own focused, specialty sales organization targeting the physicians specializing in such conditions. In the case of prurigo nodularis, we expect that we would target a subset of the dermatologists in the U.S. For chronic cough related to IPF, we expect that we would target the pulmonologists who specialize in IPF, which is a subset of the pulmonologists practicing in the U.S. For markets outside of the U.S., we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize Haduvio. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for Haduvio and our manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned four U.S. patents, seven foreign patents and multiple pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that include claims relating to methods of use of Haduvio. The issued patents expire between 2032 and 2033 and the patent applications, if issued as patents, would expire between 2032 and 2041. 
 In addition, we are party to an exclusive license agreement with Endo under which we have licensed patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize products incorporating nalbuphine hydrochloride in any formulation, including Haduvio. As of December 31, 2021, the intellectual property in-licensed under this agreement included six U.S. patents and four foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various European Union, or E.U., member states. The licensed patents from Endo include claims relating to the formulation of Haduvio. These patents expire between 2026 and 2029.
 In addition, we have in-licensed three issued U.S. patents, one issued European patent, one Japanese patent, one issued Canadian patent and a pending application in the U.S. These patents and the patent application relate to the use of nalbuphine in various movement disorders. The U.S. patents expire in 2032 and the patent issuing from the pending application, if granted, would expire in 2032. The Japanese, European and Canadian patents expire in 2032. 
 We do not own or exclusively license any composition of matter patents for Haduvio. 
 The terms of individual patents depend upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. In the U.S., a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. 
 Similar provisions are available in the E.U. and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension of a non-U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension. We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize Haduvio or any future product candidate may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the E.U., extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, sales, pricing, reimbursement, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the U.S.
 In the U.S., drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor. The failure of a sponsor to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or the post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the U.S. generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the FDA will consider approving the product candidate: 
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry of and manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before a sponsor begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to 
 19

the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical investigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB, which must operate in compliance with FDA regulations, must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on review of available data from the study, to which only the DSMB maintains access. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of a clinical trial can occur if the DSMB determines that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the 
 20

following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
 There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, as required by the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast-track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before they participate in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well-controlled and closely monitored. 
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug. Such Phase 3 clinical trials are referred to as “pivotal” trials. 
 A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of FDA approval for products. 
 21

Progress reports detailing the results of clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the occurrence of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Both NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues.
 Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The agreed plan, which may include a request for deferral or waiver of PREA requirements, is a requirement for submission of an NDA. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete. The law requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA.
 Submission and Review of an NDA 
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product for its intended indication. The application must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the use of a product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The NDA is a vehicle through which sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the U.S. for one or more indications. Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the U.S. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $3,117,218 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $369,413. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 22

Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the requested additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within 10 months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. 
 In connection with its review of an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the data submitted in support of the application. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is an NME. 
 The FDA may also refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Expedited Review Programs 
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of NDAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.
 Breakthrough Therapy designation. To qualify for the Breakthrough Therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a Breakthrough Therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
 Priority Review. A product candidate is eligible for Priority Review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of Priority Review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.
 Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated 
 23

approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
 Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of an NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six month extension to respond.
 An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific conditions. The FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after the initiation of commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, such as REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or a new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of 
 24

manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug product.
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the sponsor to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations that were previously conducted to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the sponsor for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the sponsor and for which the sponsor has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by or for the sponsor. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) sponsor can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the sponsor may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may 
 25

then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. 
 In order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the reference listed drug, or RLD, with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation of the FDCA by the FDA was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the sponsor may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the sponsor and are essential to the approval of the application. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the sponsor’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. The FDA’s regulations governing patient listings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021. When an ANDA sponsor files its application with the FDA, the sponsor is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA sponsor is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the sponsor is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA sponsor would. 
 Specifically, the sponsor must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, is unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the sponsor does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the sponsor is not seeking approval). 
 If the ANDA sponsor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the sponsor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification 
 26

automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA sponsor. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the sponsor is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA sponsor would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earliest of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity to the term of any existing regulatory patent or exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application for a similar product.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half of the time between the effective date of the IND and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
Health Care Law and Regulation 
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. 
 Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid; the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members.
 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some 
 27

circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform 
 In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the U.S. such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the U.S. 
 In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or 
 28

delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden revoked those orders and issued a new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
 The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.
 In addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.
 On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Order directs the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers and wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional health care organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the E.U.
 In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. 
 29

Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the E.U. generally follows the same lines as in the U.S. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of an MAA and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the E.U. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted. The Clinical Trial Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU member states, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and replacing any national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. 
 On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the European Union and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the European Union, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public.
 The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted, or concerned member states. Part II is assessed separately by each concerned member state. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned member state. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
 As in the U.S., similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the E.U. (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries.
 PRIME Designation in the E.U.
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under E.U. regulatory systems, a sponsor must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the E.U. Member States (either a decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to a sponsor established in the E.U. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, sponsors have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric 
 30

population, unless the EMA has granted (i) a product-specific waiver, (ii) a class waiver or (iii) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e. the E.U., as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may also be used in certain other cases at the request of the sponsor. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of E.U. law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the E.U. Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard”. The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which the sponsor can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the sponsor cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following: 
  
• | the sponsor must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal. 
 The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the sponsor will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies and the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may 
 31

be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each E.U. Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference E.U. Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned E.U. Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned E.U. Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all E.U. Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other E.U. Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the E.U.
 In the E.U., innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents sponsors for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic MAA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the E.U. market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be an NCE so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Patent Term Extensions in the E.U. and Other Jurisdictions
 The E.U. also provides for patent term extension through Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the U.S. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. These periods can be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained, which is described in detail below. Although SPCs are available throughout the E.U., sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the E.U.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the E.U. Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing E.U. Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the E.U., sponsors must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is 
 32

enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA must determine that a company actually complied with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If a sponsor obtains a marketing authorization in all E.U. Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the Centralized Procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate. 
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the E.U. is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
  
• | Compliance with the E.U.’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable E.U. laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice, or E.U. cGMP. These requirements include compliance with E.U. cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the E.U. with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the E.U.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the E.U. notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and E.U. Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the E.U.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the U.K.
 The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU took place on January 31, 2020. The EU and the U.K. reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the EU and the U.K. will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the U.K. is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU.
 Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the U.K. that “implements” and complements the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is now effective in the U.K., it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the U.K. will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the U.K. will be treated like an EU Member State in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the U.K. will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the U.K. The U.K. has already determined that it considers all of the E.U. and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the U.K. to the E.U. and EEA remain unaffected. We may, however, incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the U.K. privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them. 
 General Data Protection Regulation 
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of individuals in the E.U., including personal health data, is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing notice to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the E.U., including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is 
 33

greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business. 
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products 
 In the E.U., pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the E.U. provides options for the E.U. Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other E.U. Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the E.U. have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the E.U. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly with respect to prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced E.U. Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 employees, with 15 employees engaged in research and development and the remaining nine engaged in general management and administration, including finance and commercial. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards in ways that are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. We value our employees and regularly benchmark total rewards we provide, such as short- and long-term compensation, 401(k) contributions, health, welfare and quality of life benefits, paid time off and personal leave, against our industry peers to ensure we remain competitive and attractive to potential new hires.
