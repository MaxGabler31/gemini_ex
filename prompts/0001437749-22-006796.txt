ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History

On June 22, 2017, the Group filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma to change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.”, which became effective on June 29, 2017.
 
The Group, formerly known as 3DIcon Corporation, was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Prior to September 30, 2016, the Group’s primary activity had been the raising of capital in order to pursue its goal of becoming a significant participant in the development, commercialization and marketing of next generation 3D display technologies.
 
On September 30, 2016, Coretec Industries LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, and the Group issued an aggregate 15,870 shares of the Group’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; those shares were subsequently converted into 30,374,363 shares of common stock. 
 
Overview of the Company.
 
Coretec’s Technology. The Coretec Group owns intellectual property and patents related to the production and application of engineered silicon to enable new technologies and to improve the lifespan and performance of a variety of materials in a range of industries. The Company is exploring opportunities to use its silicon discoveries and developments to improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries, solid-state LED lights and semiconductors, among other technologies. It is also exploring ways to use its silicon intellectual property to develop optical plastics to advance development of its CSpace 3D imaging chamber.
 
Cyclohexasilane (CHS). Coretec’s underlying technology is focused on the production of a high-value liquid silicon precursor, cyclohexasilane (“CHS”). A key advantage of CHS is that it remains in liquid form at room temperature and does not convert to a gas until heated above 450°F. CHS is superior to other silicon precursor in many ways compared to materials commonly used for manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors and solar cells (monosilane or trichlorosilane), which have much lower boiling points that require more prescriptive handling that results in higher shipping and handling costs. Using CHS offers several potential technical advantages of using CHS versus common silicon precursors. The Company anticipates that CHS will first be used as an alternative to monosilane or trichlorosilane when adding silicon to lithium ion batteries or when used in manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors.
 
The Company also envisions long-term potential in several emerging markets where there are opportunities to convert CHS into nanoparticles and nanowires, for such purposes as:
 

● | Energy storage 
--+-----------------------------------------------------
● | Solid –state LED lighting 
● | Printable electronics 
● | Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar energy

 
Enhancement of CSpace. The Company’s CSpace segment is developing technologies to produce 360-degree volumetric, high-resolution images in a 3D image chamber. The Company is applying its technical expertise and intellectual property in silicon-based materials to advance commercialization prospects for its CSpace technology.
 
A key challenge in the evolution of CSpace® is the development of the material used for the image chamber. The Company has explored a variety of glass alternatives. While progress has been made, it has been concluded that limitations remain, primarily in the weight and cost of a glass medium.
 
    4 

  

A key virtue of having our IP portfolio of silicon-based materials is that we use all of the manufacturing infrastructure and knowledge that is available for optical plastics for the CSpace® image chamber. The benefit to CSpace® is that silicon-based optical plastics can be molded into a broad range of shapes and may enable the development of a much lighter-weight and more affordable image chamber than previous versions.
 
Near-Term Revenue Opportunities. Opportunities for near-term revenue continue to be explored in battery and microelectronic markets. Interest in the use of silicon in Li-ion batteries continues to increase driven by the growing demand for electrical vehicles, the exploitation of mobile electronics, and energy storage systems for backup power and improved efficiency of home and commercial wind and solar systems. Discussions are ongoing with suppliers of Li-ion battery anode materials that are seeking next generation materials to further increase performance while improving lifetime, charging time, safety and reliability. We believe these suppliers will be well positioned to take advantage of the benefits provided by CHS when combined as a liquid with other solid-based materials. While we believe the use of CHS in Li-ion batteries will provide near term revenue, we also continue to explore revenue opportunities in microelectronics and especially those early adopter markets where advanced microelectronics are being developed in lower volumes and with less price sensitivity. 
Cyclohexasilane Business
 
The Company’s business model is to identify and commercialize disruptive technologies in silicon serving advanced technology markets. Sources of disruptive technology are licensed technology created by major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Where technology does not already exist, the Company intends to sponsor and jointly develop research with its customers.
 
Coretec is developing, testing, and providing new and/or improved technologies and resulting product solutions for energy-related industries including, but not limited to energy storage, renewable energy, energy conservation, and distributed energy industries. Many of these technologies and resulting product solutions can also be applied to the broader markets of anti-counterfeit packaging, medical devices, electronics, photonics, and displays. The initial technologies and product solutions are based on new innovations in:
 
● | Cyclohexasilane (Si6H12) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------
● | Silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) 
● | “Stacked” polysilane ((R2Si)n) 
● | Doped alloy variants of the various silicon innovations
● | Future, high-refractive-index siloxane polymers (HRISP)

 
Early adoption of these technologies and resulting product solutions is anticipated in markets for energy storage (lithium-ion batteries), solid-state lighting (LEDs), solar energy and printable electronics.
 
Coretec’s management leverages years of expertise and experience in equipment and services for the energy storage industry, procuring and managing investments and financial services, and in R&D and commercialization of material and chemical technologies.
 
CHS Business Model
 
Coretec’s business model includes monitoring the ever-growing catalogue of new technologies and valuable IP for licensing opportunities that could lead to incremental improvements and/or additional features in resulting products or lead to next generation products for use by energy-related industries and is created and held within universities and other parties that may lack financial resources and/or interest to further develop and commercialize them.
 
Additionally, where needs exist, but new technologies and resulting products are not currently available, the Company aims to conduct research-and-development (“R&D”) activities through sponsored projects performed at major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Coretec will leverage existing, world-class expertise, experience, and laboratory facilities in these non-profit entities for R&D, testing, and proof-of-concept studies up to and including studies at the device level that may be required to create commercialization opportunities.
 
    5 

  

Following these proof-of-concept studies, commercialization opportunities (e.g., manufacturing, marketing, sales) created for its technologies and IP will include, but are not limited to:
 

● | Joint ventures or other business collaborations with Coretec’s joint development partners who can manufacture, market and sell new or improved products (based upon Coretec’s technologies and IP) into existing or new supply chains
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Manufacturing, marketing and selling its own products 
● | Creating exit strategies such as: 


o | The sale of one or more technologies and related IP to the private sector 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | The licensing of and/or sublicensing of one or more technologies and related IP to the private sector
o | Other business transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs 

CHS Research & Development
 
Coretec’s priorities for R&D and commercialization are customer- and market-driven and guided by the needs and specifications of the energy-related industries served. Identified customer- and market-driven opportunities include:

● | Novel silicon-based materials that facilitate “greener” more eco-friendly energy production, including:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Lower-cost, longer-life, higher-capacity battery energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), for use in transportation and distributed power-generation systems 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | More aesthetically appealing, lower cost building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) 
o | Flexible and/or printable electronics for use in monitoring the condition of distributed or remote assets, e.g., wind power and embedded, wireless sensors to detect corrosion and other changes in pipelines.


● | Novel silicon-based materials that facilitate “greener” more energy efficient products, such as the encapsulation of high-brightness LEDs to improve light extraction, and solar cells to improve full-spectrum light collection 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Novel silicon-based materials that facilitate more efficient and eco-friendly exploration and monitoring of distributed energy industries, including imaging materials for visualizing oil and gas exploration and distribution data using volumetric 3D displays 
● | Novel silicon-based materials that prevent illegal imitation or reproduction of a product or service used within energy-related industries, including trusted-supply products (anti-counterfeit packaging) for supply chain assurance, currency, identity documents, lottery tickets, etc.

 
    6 

  

Future CHS Revenue
 
In the future, the Company anticipates revenue from one or more business transactions, such as:
 

● | The sale of Coretec novel silicon-based materials that improve or otherwise enhance the performance of such products as lithium-ion batteries, electronics, solar cells, and displays and/or other optical-based devices
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A share of the revenue from the sale of jointly developed product(s) and/or from one or more joint ventures with strategic partners 
● | The sale or licensing of technologies and associated intellectual property to joint development partners or other companies 

 
CHS Competition
 
Based on market research and competitive analysis, the Company believes its CHS technology is unique and provides an advantage in that should allow for 1) high-yield, low-cost production using readily available raw materials, 2) storage, transport and use as a liquid at room temperature 3) processing of the liquid into fibers, particles, and films that, when heated, form silicon, and 4) the creation of doped silicon by doping CHS at an atomic level. Competing silanes provided by numerous manufacturers exist as a gas at room temperature, making them explosive. This results in greater costs for storage, handling, transportation and use. The closest competitor to Coretec’s CHS is cyclopentasilane which exists as a gas at room temperature. Cyclopentasilane has proven costly and difficult to manufacture. Other competitors exist for specific applications. For example, graphene and carbon nanotubes are potential competitors in printable electronics. However, they are only now emerging and require a purification process that is proving costly. 
 
Coretec’s business and commercialization model is based in part upon establishing joint development partnerships with companies that are commercially successful and financially sound as well as deeply embedded in the supply chains for the aforementioned energy-related products. For example, Coretec is developing a strategic partnership with a domestic supplier of silicon-based materials that will facilitate further development and scale-up of cyclohexasilane (Si6H12) plus chemical derivatives and other materials based on CHS. This strategic partnership will enable Coretec to supply large quantities of these novel silicon materials to those companies interested in producing prototype batteries, electronics, and photovoltaic/solar cells for testing and commercial evaluation. Coretec will continue to seek other such strategic partnerships within the private sector.
 
CHS - Intellectual Property Status
 
The Company is currently awaiting evaluation and approval from USPTO of three full applications. In March 2020 the Company filed a full patent application called “Method of preparing CYCLOSILANE” for a cost-effective and scalable method for producing CHS. In June 2021 the Company filed a full patent application called “Surface-functionalized silicon quantum dots” a general method to append dye molecules on a silicon quantum dot, regardless of how the silicon quantum dot is prepared. In February of 2022, the Company filed a full patent application called “Cyclohexasilane for Electrodes” that covers using CHS as a low temperature silicon source to create silicon nitride powders, thin films, or nanoparticles/nanowires to be utilized in silicon anodes.
 
In addition, the Company filed a provisional patent in August of 2021 for methods to produce quantum dots utilizing CHS. This provisional patent is titled “Routes to Silicon Quantum Dots (CHS & Other Silanes)” and the Company will file the full patent application in August of 2022.
 
Volumetric 3D Display Business
 
The Company owns the rights to a patented volumetric 3D display technology that was developed by and with the University of Oklahoma (the “University”) under a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”). The development to date has resulted in multiple technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents. Five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.

On May 26, 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") approved the patent called "Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display" for rendering a three-dimensional image and converted it to U.S. patent No. 7,537,345. On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the patent called “Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe the foundation of what is called CSpace® technology (“CSpace”).
 
Overview of Volumetric 3D Display Technology 
 
Commercialization Strategy and Target Applications
 
The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through customer-funded research-and-development contracts and technology licensing agreements for such high-value applications as air-traffic control, design visualization, and medical imaging. The Company plans to develop products for contract engineering and with joint development customers. At this time the Company does not have any commercialized products and does not plan to develop its own products based on the CSpace technology due to the high –value, low-volume nature of the best-fit initial applications for this technology. These applications include but are not limited to the following:

● | Healthcare (diagnostics, surgical planning, training, telemedicine, bio surveillance) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cybersecurity data visualization 
● | Military (operational planning, training, modeling and simulation, battlespace awareness, damage assessment, autonomous piloting)
● | Physical security (passenger, luggage & cargo screening) 
● | Mining, oil & gas exploration 
● | Meteorological and oceanographic data visualization 

 
CSpace Competition
 
Based on market research, we have concluded that the CSpace volumetric technology is unique and advantaged versus other 3D technologies in that it can deliver both 1) a true 360-degree viewing experience for multiple simultaneous users, and 2) high image quality, high reliability and large image size. Rear projection 3D displays such as those from Zecotek, Setred, and EuroLCDs (formerly LC Tech LightSpace) do not provide a 360-degree viewing experience and are typically limited to one or two users. Early proof-of-concept work done on infrared active phosphor displays by 3D Display Laboratories proved to not be scalable due to limited phosphor persistence and vector scanning limitations. While holographic and light-field displays show promise, they do not deliver a true 360-degree viewing experience and cost-effective multiple user systems do not appear feasible due to current and expected pixel density, data bandwidth and compute power limitations.
 
History of 3D Technology Research and Development at the University of Oklahoma
 
Beginning in 2007 the University, under an SRA with the Company, undertook the development of high potential 3D display technologies. It is anticipated that Coretec’s technology will play a key role in the continued development of an image space material for CSpace.
