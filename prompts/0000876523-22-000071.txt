ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Purpose, Vision and Strategy
EZCORP, Inc. is a leading provider of pawn services in the United States and Latin America with over 1,175 locations and approximately 7,000 Team Members. We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas.
Our purpose statement:
“We exist to serve our customers’ short-term cash needs, helping them to live and enjoy their lives.
We are driven by a diverse team with a passion for pawn who are motivated to be their best — because our customers, families, stakeholders, and the communities and environment in which we live deserve it.”
 This purpose is supported by a customer-centric strategy that includes the following:
•Providing fast, easy and simple access to cash;
•Serving our customers in a friendly and respectful way;
•Always being competitive and fair;
•Passionately serving customer needs;
•Building enduring relationships; and
•Recognizing and rewarding customer loyalty.
That strategy consists of three fundamental pillars:
•Strengthen the Core — Renewed focus on the unique and essential elements of our pawn business. 
•Cost Management and Simplification — Management of cost base through ongoing simplification.
•Innovate and Grow — Broaden customer engagement to serve more customers more frequently in more locations.
And we rely on four foundational capabilities to execute our strategy and achieve our purpose:
•Team Members — We enable diverse, engaged and tenured teams with a true passion for pawnbroking.
•IT and Data Modernization — We modernize our IT and data assets to capitalize on growth opportunities and create greater value at every customer interaction.
•Risk Management and Building a Culture of Compliance — We are continually focused on improving capabilities to manage operational, financial, regulatory, compliance, information security and reputational risk.
•Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) — We prioritize developing the foundational elements of a comprehensive and integrated sustainability program to make everyday living more affordable and sustainable. 
Overview of Our Business
At September 30, 2022, we operated a total of 1,175 locations, consisting of:
•515 U.S. pawn stores (operating primarily as EZPAWN or Value Pawn & Jewelry);
•528 Mexico pawn stores (operating primarily as Empeño Fácil and Cash Apoyo Efectivo); and
•132 pawn stores in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (operating as GuatePrenda and MaxiEfectivo).
At our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property and sell merchandise to customers looking for good value. The merchandise we sell primarily consists of second-hand collateral forfeited from our pawn activities or merchandise purchased from customers. By store count, we are the second largest pawn store owner and operator in the U.S. and one of the largest in Latin America. We also offer web-based applications named EZ+ that allow customers to manage their pawn transactions, layaways and loyalty rewards online.
In addition to our core pawn business in the U.S. and Latin America, we have made the following strategic investments:
•We own 43.7% of Cash Converters International Limited (“Cash Converters”), a publicly traded company (ASX: CCV) headquartered in Perth, Western Australia. Cash Converters and its controlled companies comprise a diverse group generating revenues from franchising, store operations, personal finance (including pawn transactions) and vehicle finance in over 700 stores across 14 countries.
•We own approximately 14.6% of Rich Data Corporation (“RDC”), a Singapore-based software-as-a-service company that utilizes global financial services expertise, advanced artificial intelligence and non-traditional data to deliver a next-generation credit scoring and decisioning platform.
•We own a preferred interest in a private company that has majority ownership in Simple Management Group, Inc. (“SMG”), which owns and operates 21 pawn stores principally in the Caribbean, with plans to build and acquire more stores in that region. 
We generate revenues primarily from pawn service charges (“PSC”) on pawn loans outstanding (“PLO”), merchandise sales and jewelry scrapping. We remain focused on optimizing our balance of PLO and the resulting higher PSC. The following chart presents sources of gross profit, including PSC, merchandise sales gross profit ("Merchandise sales GP") and jewelry scrapping gross profit ("Jewelry scrapping GP") for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020:

Pawn Activities
At our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property. We earn pawn service charges (“PSC”) for those cash advances, and the PSC rate varies by state and transaction size. At the time of the transaction, we take possession of the pawned collateral, which consists of tangible personal property, generally jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods and musical instruments. If the customer chooses to redeem their pawn, they will repay the amount advanced plus any accrued PSC. If the customer chooses not to redeem their pawn, the pawned collateral becomes our inventory, which we sell in our retail merchandise sales activities or, in some cases, scrap for its inherent gold or precious stone content. Consequently, the success of our pawn business is largely dependent on our ability to accurately assess the probability of pawn redemption and the estimated resale or scrap value of the collateralized personal property. 
As of September 30, 2022, we had a closing PLO balance of $210.0 million. In fiscal 2022, PSC accounted for approximately 36% of our total revenues and 61% of our gross profit.
In the U.S., our PSC rates generally vary between 13% and 25% per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn term generally ranges between 30 and 90 days. Individual pawn transactions typically average between $140 and $170.
In Mexico, PSC rates generally vary between 15% and 21% per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn primary term is 30 days. Individual pawn transactions typically average between 1,100 and 1,400 Mexican pesos, or approximately $60 to $70 on average using the average exchange rate for fiscal 2022.
In GPMX, PSC rates generally vary between 12% and 18% per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn primary term is 30 days. Individual pawn transactions are made in the local currency of the country and typically average between $100 and $120 using the average exchange rates for fiscal 2022. The average transaction amounts tend to be higher in the GPMX countries than in Mexico due to the higher concentration of jewelry used as pawn collateral.
If a customer chooses not to redeem, renew or extend their pawn, the pawn collateral is forfeited and becomes inventory available for sale. We do not record losses or charge-offs when the pawned collateral is forfeited because the amount advanced for the unpaid pawn becomes the inventory carrying cost of the forfeited collateral. The difference between the subsequent sale of the forfeited collateral and the amount of the pawn (offset by any inventory reserve) is reflected in merchandise sales gross margin.
The redemption rate represents the percentage of pawns made that are repaid, renewed or extended, including pawns that may be extended multiple times in a given time period. The following table presents our redemption rates by segment:

 | Fiscal Year Ended September 30,
Redemption Rate | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
U.S. Pawn | 84% | 86% | 88% 
Latin America Pawn | 79% | 80% | 78% 

Our ability to offer quality second-hand goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value-conscious customers. The gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the estimated resale or scrap value at the time the property is either accepted as pawn collateral or purchased and our ability to sell that merchandise in a timely manner. As a significant portion of our inventory and sales involve gold and jewelry, our results can be influenced by the market price of gold and diamonds. 
Customers in the U.S. and the majority of our Latin America stores may purchase a product protection plan that allows them to exchange certain general merchandise (non-jewelry) sold through our retail pawn operations within six months of purchase. In the U.S., we also offer a jewelry VIP package, which guarantees customers a minimum future pawn advance amount on the item sold, allows them full credit if they trade in the item to purchase a more expensive piece of jewelry and provides minor repair service on the item sold. Customers may also purchase an item on layaway by paying a minimum layaway deposit of typically 10% of the item’s sale price, in addition to an upfront fee. We hold items on layaway for a 90-to-180-day period, during which the customer is required to pay the balance of the sales price through a series of installment payments. If a payment is missed, we hold the item for up to 30 days, after which it is returned to active inventory for sale.
Operations and Risk Management
Our pawn operations are designed to provide the optimum level of support to the store teams, providing coaching, mentoring and problem solving to identify opportunities to better serve our customers and position us to be the leader in customer service and satisfaction.
Our risk management structure consists of asset protection, compliance and internal audit departments, which monitor the inventory system, lending practices, regulatory compliance and compliance with our policies and procedures. We perform full physical audits of inventory at 
each store at least annually, and more often in higher risk stores or those experiencing higher shrinkage. Inventory counts are completed daily for jewelry and firearms, and other inventory categories more susceptible to theft are cycle counted multiple times annually. We record shrink adjustments for known losses at the conclusion of each inventory count. These adjustments are recorded as estimates during interim periods and as discovered during cycle counts.
Human Capital Management
Engagement Survey
We launched a Global Employee Engagement Survey, administered by Glint, in June 2022, and had an 81% participation rate with an overall engagement score of 81. Our engagement score is six points higher than the global benchmark, which contains data from over 900 companies of varying size across a variety of industries (Finance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Professional Services, Retail, Technology and Utilities) and includes results from over eight million respondents located in over 150 countries.
Our top strengths were Career, Customer Focus and Growth. Our focus areas for improvement included Team, Valued Teammate, and Work-Life Balance. Team Members provided over 9,200 comments with mixed sentiment, 26% positive, 39% neutral and 35% negative. To ensure we address issues raised in the survey, all people leaders at the District Manager and above level will have Engagement Objectives for fiscal 2023, guided by actions that will yield the greatest business and Team Member impact.
Talent Management and Development
We employ approximately 7,000 Team Members across all our geographies, including over 3,300 in United States, just under 2,900 in Mexico and around 800 in Central America. We seek to hire and promote Team Members to lead the way today and to step into greater roles in the future. We achieve this goal through Training and Development programs that Team Members can use to plan their careers and identify future growth opportunities. We engage Team Members at all levels so we can understand their professional and personal goals, identify high potential future leaders to strengthen our internal bench, support them in their journey and retain our talent. 
In our pawn stores we provide:
•An onboarding program that blends online and hands-on training in the art and science of pawnbroking;
•Career path programs aligned with our talent and succession strategy, emphasizing career progression and individual development programs; and
•A learning experience that unlocks and accelerates Team Member potential as well as business growth.
 Our investment in store-level Team Members produced tangible results during fiscal 2022:
•High scoring questions in our 2022 Global Employee Engagement Survey included “I know the career path(s) available to me at EZCORP” (with an 86% favorability rating) and “I have good opportunities to learn and develop at EZCORP” (with an 83% favorability rating).
•Over 65% of managerial positions are filled via internal promotion.
In our Corporate Support Center, we reinforced the utilization of our career and competency framework to build individual development plans to guide the career paths of corporate Team Members and to prepare them for future roles. 
Culture and Ethics
Culture is critical to our long-term success and to our ability to attract, develop and retain the top talent needed to accomplish our Purpose, Vision and Strategy.
Our values — People, Pawn, Passion — define our priorities as a business, and our Guiding Principles — Leadership, Customer Service, Accountability, Respect, Diversity and Sustainability — characterize the expectations for how we interact with Team Members, customers and communities. Various tools are used to globally demonstrate commitment to our principles, values, and positive culture, including a plain-language Code of Conduct and supporting policies, annual training on expectations and clear communications from executive management reinforcing ethical behavior and a positive culture. 
To support our ethical business practices, we maintain an Ethics Hotline available to all Team Members and external stakeholders to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline (which is managed by an independent third party) are routed to appropriate functions (whether Human Resources, Legal or Compliance), and in some cases directly to the Board of Directors, for investigation and resolution. In addition, any shareholder or other interested party may send communications to the Board of Directors, either individually or as a group, through a process that is outlined in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Diversity and Inclusion
At EZCORP, we foster an environment that values diversity, inclusion, and development for all. In our 2022 Global Employee Engagement Survey, 81% of participants responded positively to the question, “I feel a sense of belonging at EZCORP.” In fiscal 2022, we completed the actions of our two-year Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan with four goals:
•Commitment and Accountability — Demonstrate commitment and accountability through corporate policy, communications and actions that advance the goals of the plan.
•Workplace Inclusion — Foster work environments that value diversity and inclusion and encourage collaboration, flexibility, and fairness.
•Diverse Workforce — Recruit and promote from diverse, qualified candidate pools to increase diversity of perspectives and experiences.
•Sustainability — Identify and eliminate systemic barriers by embedding diversity and inclusion in all human capital life cycle policies and practices.
Key changes include: 
•Analyzing Diversity and Inclusion results within the Engagement Survey;
•Providing Diversity Dashboard reporting to the Board of Directors and executive management; 
•Implementing annual training and education on Diversity and Inclusion matters;
•Implementing Women’s Empowerment (U.S. and Latin America) and Black Empowerment (U.S.) Affinity Groups;
•Implementing required “blind” resume review process for all corporate office hiring; and
•Implementing a requirement that, for all Store Manager and above positions, the interview and selection process must include one diverse Team Member.

Total Rewards
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of Team Members with individual and Company performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate Team Members to achieve results. 
The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:
•We provide wages and incentive plans that are competitive and consistent with positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. Additionally, on an annual basis (U.S.) gender and racial/ethnic analysis is performed to ensure pay equity.
•We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and to provide benchmarking against our selected peer group, which includes direct competitors in the pawn industry and similarly-sized companies from relevant industries that serve similar customer bases, operate in the retail or consumer finance industries and typically have similar operating dynamics. 
•We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance.
•All employees are eligible for paid time off, retirement savings plan and Company-paid life insurance. 
Health and Safety
Our commitment to our Team Members is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We continue to invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. Throughout our response to COVID-19, our priority has remained protecting the health and safety of our Team Members and customers. 
In fiscal 2022, our leadership team regularly reviewed and adapted our policies and practices based on evolving information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our pawn locations are provided with personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning supplies and are required to adhere to appropriate protocols for social distancing, limiting density, taking temperatures and reporting exposures.
Management and Oversight
The People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has primary responsibility for analyzing, advising and (as appropriate) approving executive compensation. The committee is also responsible for organizational development matters and otherwise assisting the Board of Directors in its overall responsibility to enable EZCORP to attract, retain, develop, and motivate qualified executives who will contribute to the long-term success of the Company.
The committee actively participates in the executive recruitment and selection process. Committee members are instrumental in the executive talent management and succession processes, including the review and attainment of annual objectives for our executive officers. All Executive Officers have a minimum of one objective related to People, generally broken into the areas of Employee Engagement Scores, Voluntary Attrition and Inclusion.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
EZCORP is committed to meeting our customers’ needs in a responsible manner, and in that regard, we have aligned purpose, vision, values, guiding principles and business strategy with environmental, social and governance sustainability factors. 
Our pawnbroking and related retail sales activities inherently contribute to the “circular economy” and promote environmental sustainability. We provide unique options for our customers to satisfy their needs for cash — options that are not offered by traditional lenders such as banks and credit unions, credit card providers or installment and short-term lenders. For many of our customers, pawn transactions provide an essential and financially responsible lifeline for meeting their unexpected expenses. Our retail activities rely primarily on local sourcing of pre-owned merchandise and the recirculation of those items back into the neighborhoods we serve. In short, our business is unique, essential and sustainable.
Environmental Sustainability
Our business contributes to overall environmental sustainability in the following ways:
•Our business is fundamentally a neighborhood business, where each store principally serves the surrounding neighborhood. This “local” focus reduces the need of our customers to travel long distances to access our products and services and eliminates the need for delivery services.
•Each of our stores serves as its own “supply chain.” We take in pre-owned merchandise, either through pawn or purchases from customers, and then sell that merchandise (after forfeiture, in the case of pawn transactions) generally in the same store. Thus, we do not maintain or rely on mass supply, distribution or warehousing facilities.
•Virtually all of the merchandise we sell is pre-owned, which contributes to second-hand goods recycling and the circular economy. In fiscal 2022, we sold more than 5.6 million pre-owned items, including over 3.2 million items in the consumer electronics, camera and household goods categories, 1.5 million other general merchandise items (such as tools and musical instruments) and 775,000 jewelry items. In addition, through our jewelry scrapping activities, we recycle significant volumes of gold and diamonds. All of these activities effectively extend the useful life of many products, reducing waste and lessening the demand for new manufacturing and mining. 
•Our store operations themselves leave a relatively small carbon footprint when compared to big-box or other mass retailers that rely on manufacturers and extensive supply chain and distribution channels. Our stores are relatively small (generally 3,300 square feet or less). To reduce energy consumption, we have installed energy-efficient LED lighting in 70% of our U.S. stores and are working to convert the remaining stores across all geographies.
•In all of our facilities, including our corporate support offices, we promote environmental stewardship by reducing consumption, recycling paper products (approximately 1 million pounds across all U.S. locations during fiscal 2022) and responsibly disposing of end-of-life computers, electronics and related accessories through recycling or other sound e-waste processing. Our corporate office in Austin, Texas is LEED Certified Silver status.
Social Responsibility
Our business promotes social responsibility in the following ways:
•Our business serves as an essential and responsible financial resource for many unbanked and or underserved consumers who have limited access to traditional forms of capital or credit and comprise a large majority of our customer base. We improve the reach and access to financial services through neighborhood-based stores, supported by digital offerings. We provide instant access to cash in transactions that generally average around $170 or less. Our pawn transactions are simple, transparent, regulated and safe, and funding approval is based on the valuation of the collateral item, not on the credit worthiness of the customer. The customer is under no legal obligation to repay the amount advanced; we do not engage in collection efforts or take other legal actions against our customers; and we do not report transaction histories to external credit agencies. Rather, the customer may choose to repay the amount advanced or forfeit the collateralized merchandise.
•Our stores facilitate transactions in a safe and secure environment for Team Members and customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented various safety protocols, including social distancing, mask wearing and enhanced cleaning and sanitation practices, for the health and safety of our Team Members and customers.
•Customer satisfaction measurement and feedback are key factors in improving our customer service and Team Member engagement. To capture direct customer feedback, we have enabled Google Reviews across all stores and have received over 125,000 Google Reviews with an average satisfaction rating of 4.8 out of 5 in the U.S.
•We offer customers multiple payment options, including cross-store, over-the-phone and web-based and mobile platforms, reducing their need to travel to the stores to make payments. Online payments are accepted on layaway, pawn extension and bulk payments, with electronic payment receipts delivered on these transactions. 
•Through the EZCORP Foundation Scholarship Fund, we provided financial assistance to the dependents of our U.S.-based Team Members pursuing higher education, and have issued a total of $180,000 in scholarship awards towards college expenses for recipients with demonstrated financial need, academic merit and commitment to leadership.
•For a discussion of our Diversity and Inclusion initiatives, see “Human Capital Management — Diversity and Inclusion” above.
Governance
At EZCORP, we believe that “The Way We Do Business is as Important as the Business We Do.” That belief underlies our Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations and provides guidance on how our Team Members can carry out their daily activities ethically and responsibly. Our ethical principles include Honesty, Integrity, Reliability, Loyalty, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, Leadership and Diversity, and these principles form the foundation for how we govern our business.
•Even though we are a “Controlled Company” under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we maintain the governance standards required of all publicly-listed Nasdaq companies, including:
•Independent directors comprise a majority of our Board of Directors. In fact, four of the seven members of our Board of Directors meet all of the “independence” requirements set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and none of the independent directors have any past or existing relationship with our controlling stockholder outside of their Board service.
•All of our standing Board committees (Audit Committee, People and Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee) are comprised of solely independent directors.
•We satisfy Nasdaq’s board diversity rules, with two of our seven Board members being diverse directors, one of whom self-identifies as female and an underrepresented minority and one whom self-identifies as an underrepresented minority.
For further discussion of our corporate governance standards, see “Part III, Item 10 — Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
•Our pawn operations are licensed and supervised in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain a strong compliance culture that is monitored and overseen by our Board of Directors and supported by seasoned regulatory and compliance teams.
•Protecting the privacy, integrity and security of our customers’ data and our enterprise network is a top priority that is also monitored and overseen by our Board of Directors. We maintain a separate IT Security team that is responsible for the design and implementation of our cyber risk strategy, including deployment of systems, enterprise-wide training, monitoring and reporting of threat incidents and response preparedness.
Growth and Expansion
Part of our strategy is to grow the number of locations we operate through opening new (“de novo”) locations and through acquisitions in both Latin America and the U.S. and potential new markets. Our ability to add new stores is dependent on several variables, such as projected achievement of internal investment hurdles, the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates, the alignment of acquirer/seller price expectations, the regulatory environment, local zoning ordinances, access to capital and availability of qualified personnel.
During fiscal 2022, we continued our expansion in Latin America with the opening of 28 de novo stores (20 in Mexico and 8 in Guatemala). We now own a total of 660 stores in Latin America, representing 56% of our total pawn stores. In fiscal 2022, these stores represented 23% of our consolidated gross profit as the average scale of Latin America pawn stores is smaller than in the U.S. We see opportunity for further expansion in Latin America through both acquisitions and de novo openings.
For further information about our acquisitions, see Note 3: Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.”
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
In the U.S., PSC is historically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter (July through September) due to a higher average PLO balance during the summer and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June) following the tax refund season, and merchandise sales are highest in our first and second fiscal quarters (October through March) due to the holiday season, jewelry sales surrounding Valentine’s Day and the availability of tax refunds. In Latin America, most of our customers receive additional compensation from their employers in December, and many receive additional compensation in June or July, applying downward pressure on PLO balances and fueling some merchandise sales in those periods. As a net effect of these and other factors and excluding discrete charges, our consolidated profit before tax is generally highest in our first fiscal quarter (October through December) and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June).
Competition
We encounter significant competition in connection with all of our activities. These competitive conditions may have an impact on our revenues, profitability and ability to expand. We compete with other pawn stores, credit service organizations, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, such as consumer finance companies. We believe the primary elements of competition are the quality of customer service and relationship management, including understanding our customers’ needs better than anyone else, convenience, store location and a customer-friendly environment. In addition, we believe the ability to compete effectively will be based increasingly on strong general management, regional focus, automated management information systems, access to capital and superior customer service.
Our competitors for merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores such as jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites. Competitive factors in our retail operations include the ability to provide customers with a variety of merchandise at an exceptional value coupled with exceptional customer service and convenient locations.
The pawn industry in the United States is large, relatively mature and highly fragmented. The industry consists of a few large operators (of which we are the second largest) and then independent operators who primarily own one to three locations.
The pawn industry in Latin America is also fragmented, but less so than in the United States. The industry consists of pawn stores owned by independent operators and chains, including some not-for-profit organizations. We are the second largest for-profit operator in Mexico and the largest operator in Guatemala. The pawn industry, particularly full-line stores dealing in both general merchandise and jewelry, remains in an expansion stage in Latin America.
Trademarks and Trade Names
We operate our U.S. pawn stores principally under the names “EZPAWN” or “Value Pawn & Jewelry,” our Mexico pawn stores principally under the name “EMPEÑO FÁCIL” and “Cash Apoyo Efectivo,” our Guatemala pawn stores under the name “GuatePrenda,” and our El Salvador and Honduras pawn stores under the name “MaxiEfectivo.” We have registered the names EZPAWN, Value Pawn & Jewelry and EZCORP, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In Mexico, we have registered the names “EMPEÑO FÁCIL,” “Bazareño,” “Presta Dinero”, “Montepio San Patricio” and “Cash Apoyo Efectivo” with the Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial. We have registered the name “GuatePrenda” in Guatemala and the name “MaxiEfectivo” in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. 
Regulation
Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is an integral part of how we manage our business, and we conduct our business in material compliance with all of these rules. The following is a general description of significant regulations affecting our business.
U.S. Regulations
Pawn Regulations — Our pawn stores are regulated by the states in which they are located and, in some cases, by individual municipalities or other local authorities. The applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations vary from location to location and typically impose licensing requirements for pawn stores or individual pawn store Team Members. Licensing requirements typically relate to financial responsibility and character and may establish restrictions on where pawn stores can operate. Additional rules regulate various aspects of the day-to-day pawn operations, including the pawn service charges that a pawn store may charge, the maximum amount of a pawn loan, the minimum or maximum term of a pawn loan, the content and format of the pawn ticket, and the length of time after a pawn loan default that a pawn store must hold a pawned item before it can be offered for sale. Failure to observe applicable regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of pawn licenses, the imposition of fines or requirements to refund service charges and fees, and other civil or criminal penalties. We must also comply with various federal requirements regarding the disclosure of the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments and payment schedule related to each pawn loan transaction. Additional federal regulations applicable to our pawn lending business are described in “Other Regulations” below.
The majority of our pawn stores, voluntarily or pursuant to applicable laws, provide periodic (generally daily) reports to local law enforcement agencies. These reports provide local law enforcement with information about the items received from customers (whether through pawn or purchase), including a detailed description of the goods involved and the name and address of the customer. If we accept as collateral or purchase merchandise from a customer and it is determined that our customer was not the rightful owner, the merchandise is subject to recovery by the rightful owner and those losses are included in our shrinkage. Historically, we have not experienced a material number of claims of this nature.
Some of our pawn stores in the U.S. handle firearms and each of those stores maintains a federal firearms license as required by federal law. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also require each pawn store dealing in firearms to maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms. In addition, we must comply with the 
Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires us to conduct a background check before releasing, selling or otherwise disposing of firearms.
Other Regulations — Our pawn lending activities are subject to other state and federal statutes and regulations, including the following:
•We are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its underlying regulations, as well as various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these regulations, we are required to disclose to our customers our policies and practices relating to the protection and sharing of customers’ nonpublic personal information. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of customers’ nonpublic personal information, and many of these regulations dictate certain actions that we must take to notify customers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. We are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was enacted, in part, to address privacy concerns associated with the sharing of consumers’ financial information and credit history contained in consumer credit reports and limits our ability to share certain consumer report information. We are subject to the Federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and mitigating identity theft, and to adopt various policies and procedures (including Team Member training) that address and aid in detecting and responding to suspicious activity or identity theft “red flags.”
•As a provider of consumer financial products, we are prohibited from engaging in any unfair, deceptive or abusive act or practice (UDAAP) under the Dodd-Frank Act, as they can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence and undermine the financial marketplace.

In addition, federal laws and regulations require us to report certain transactions (or series of transactions) deemed suspicious to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FinCen”). Generally, a transaction is considered suspicious if we know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction (a) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to hide or disguise such funds, (b) is designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act or (c) appears to serve no legitimate business or lawful purpose.

•The Department of Defense regulations promulgated under the Military Lending Act limit the annual percentage rate charged on certain consumer loans (including pawn loans) made to active military personnel or their dependents to 36%.
Under certain circumstances, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) may be able to exercise regulatory authority over the U.S. pawn industry through its rule making authority. To date, the CFPB has not taken any steps to exercise such authority or indicated any intention to do so, although it has initiated actions against pawn companies for alleged violations of consumer lending regulations, including the Military Lending Act discussed above.
Mexico Regulations
Pawn Regulations — Federal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (PROFECO), Mexico’s primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO regulates the form and terms of pawn loan contracts (but not interest or service charge rates) and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops, including retail 
operations, and establishes registration, disclosure, bonding and reporting requirements. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to comply with PROFECO’s rules and regulations. 
PROFECO requires that we report certain transactions (or series of transactions) when a customer pawns more than three items of the same category. Anti-money laundering regulations restrict the use of cash in certain transactions. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on “vulnerable activities,” which includes certain high-value pawn and precious metal transactions.
The Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties requires us to protect our customers’ personal information. This law requires us to inform customers if we share customer personal information with third parties and to post (both online and in-store) our Data Privacy Policy.
Our pawn business in Mexico is also subject to regulation at the state and local level through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. For example, some states require permits for pawn stores to operate, certification of Team Members as trained in the valuation of merchandise and strict customer identification controls. State and local agencies often have authority to suspend store operations pending resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues.
Other Regulations — Our pawn business in Mexico is subject to the General Law of Administrative Responsibility (“GLAR”), effective July 2017, which requires us to implement an integrity policy that contains mechanisms to ensure integrity standards throughout the organization. GLAR establishes administrative penalties for improper payments to government officials, influence peddling (including the hiring of public officials and the use of undue influence) and other corrupt acts in public procurement processes. 
We are also subject to The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds from Illegal Sources, which requires reporting of certain transactions exceeding certain monetary limits, the appointment of a compliance officer and maintenance of customer identification records and controls. This law affects all vulnerable activities in Mexico and is intended to detect commercial activities arising from illicit or ill-gotten means through bilateral cooperation between Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office. The law also restricts the use of cash in certain transactions associated with high-value assets and limits, and to the extent possible, money laundering activities protected by the anonymity that such cash transactions provide. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on “vulnerable activities,” which include pawn transactions exceeding 154,433.10 Mexican pesos and retail transactions of precious metals exceeding 154,433.10 Mexican pesos. Retail transactions of precious metals in cash exceeding 308,866.20 Mexican pesos are prohibited. There are significant fines and sanctions for failure to comply with these rules.
In addition to the above, our pawn business in Mexico is subject to various general business regulations in the areas of tax compliance, customs, consumer protections, money laundering, civil protection regulations, municipal regulations, trade code (federal), public safety and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies.
Other Latin American Regulations
Local governmental entities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras also regulate lending and retail businesses. Certain laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances require basic commercial business licenses and signage permits. Operating in these countries also subjects us to other types of regulations, including regulations related to financial reporting, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, labor and employment practices, real estate transactions, anti-money laundering, commercial and electronic banking restrictions, credit card transactions, usury law, consumer protection, marketing, advertising and other general business activities. As the scope of our international operations increases, we may face additional administrative and regulatory costs in managing our business. In addition, unexpected changes in laws and regulations, administrative interpretations of local requirements or legislation, or public remarks by elected officials could negatively affect our operations and profitability.
