Overview of the Company
 
BriaCell (the “Company”) is an immuno-oncology biotechnology company with a strong focus on cancer immunotherapy. Immunotherapies have come to the forefront in the fight against cancer since they harness the body’s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. BriaCell owns the U.S. patent to SV-BR-1-GM (“Bria-IMT™”), a whole-cell targeted immunotherapy for cancer (U.S. Patent No. 7,674,456), as well as patents related to PKCδ inhibitors (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,364,460 and 9,572,793). The Company is currently advancing our targeted immunotherapy program by prioritizing a Phase I/IIa clinical trial with Bria-IMT™ in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a companion diagnostic test, BriaDx™, to identify patients most likely to benefit from Bria-IMT™. The Bria-IMT™ regimen was evaluated in four patients in a prior study in 2004-2006 by Dr. Charles Wiseman, the scientific founder, former member of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) and principal scientific advisor. Encouraging results were obtained, especially in a patient who matched Bria-IMT™ at HLA-DR alleles and had a grade II tumor. In 2017-2018 BriaCell evaluated 23 patients with advanced breast cancer with the Bria-IMT™ regimen and obtained confirmation of the ability of the Bria-IMT™ regimen to induce regression of metastatic breast cancer in patients who match Bria-IMT™ at least at one HLA allele and/or if they had grade I or grade II tumors. A combination study with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) was initiated and the first patient dosing in the “combination therapy” clinical trial occurred in September 2018. BriaCell purchased the KEYTRUDA® for this study as BriaCell does not have an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. for the supply of KEYTRUDA®. Eleven patients were dosed in the combination therapy trial with Bria-IMT™ and the immune checkpoint inhibitor KEYTRUDA® and subsequently dosing with this combination was discontinued. The study was modified under an amended protocol which evaluates the combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with Incyte Corporation experimental drugs retifanlimab (anti-PD-1 antibody similar to pembrolizumab). The study is ongoing.

It is estimated by the National Cancer Institute that in 2022, approximately 287,500 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States. That means that every two minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 43,000 are projected to die in 2022. Although about 100 times less common than in women, breast cancer also affects men. It is estimated that the lifetime risk of men getting breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000, and the American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 2,710 new cases of invasive male breast cancer will be diagnosed and approximately 530 men will die from breast cancer in 2022.
 
According to the May 2019 “Global Oncology Trends 2021” report by the IQVIA Institute, the global market for cancer drugs (including immunotherapy drugs) is expected to reach nearly $269 billion by the end of 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10% between 2021 and 2025, of which about 20% is expected to be immuno-oncology drugs.

About 12.9% percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. In 2018, there were an estimated 3,676,262 women living with female breast cancer in the United States. Approximately 81% of cases present as invasive breast cancer. Approximately 6% of new breast cancer diagnoses are Stage IV (metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”), which has already spread to other organs). Twenty to thirty percent of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will develop MBC. Breast cancer can be subdivided based on receptor status – the hormone receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR), collectively referred to as hormone receptors (HR), and the Her2/neu growth factor receptor (HER2). Based on the latest SEER statistics, 74.6% were found to be HR+/HER2−, 10.8% were triple-negative (HR−/HER2−), 10.5% were HR+/HER2+, and 4.0% were HR−/HER2+.1

It is estimated that over 150,000 women in the US are living with MBC.2 For those with metastatic disease at diagnosis, their 5-year survival rate is 27%.3 For patients who develop MBC after initially having localized disease, if they had a good response to treatment (i.e. a disease-free interval of more than 24 months), their survival rate is similar to that of patients with MBC at initial diagnosis, but if their disease-free interval is less than 24 months, their prognosis is worse.4 We currently propose that Bria-IMT’s™ indication will be for the treatment of patients with MBC who have failed at least two lines of therapy. Similarly, another study showed that the median overall survival among patients with de novo stage IV MBC was 39.2 months, while for patients with relapsed disease it was 27.2 months.5 Median progression free survival after first-line therapy is only 9 months and the survival benefit decreases with subsequent lines of therapy.6 One study showed that of 386 patients with MBC, 374 (97%) received first-line therapy, 254 (66%) received second-line therapy, 175 (45%) received third-line therapy, and 105 (27%) received therapy beyond third-line.7

The best response to Bria-IMT™ to date is in patients who matched Bria-IMT™ at one or more HLA alleles, with higher response rates for patients with 2+ HLA allele matches. If one HLA allele match is found to be sufficient, we will be able to treat ~50-60% of the patient population, while patients with 2+ HLA matches constitutes ~15-35% of cases.8 We also saw higher clinical benefit rates for patients with grade I/II tumors. Tumor differentiation in breast cancer cell lines is often described by their classification as Luminal, Basal A and Basal B subtypes, with Luminal representing well differentiated tumors, Basal B poorly differentiated tumors, and Basal A an intermediate stage tumor (“moderately” differentiated).2 Yao and colleagues in 2005 identified a 9-gene signature (AURKB, CENPI, DEPDC1, DEPDC1B, FAM83D, FGD3, NCAPH, TNFRSF18, FCGR1A) discriminating poorly (grade 3) from moderately (grade 2) differentiated tumors.3 To understand the place of SV-BR-1-GM in this model, we compared its RNA expression profile with those of three other cell lines representing Luminal (MCF-7), Basal A (MDA-MB-468) and Basal B (MDA-MB-231), using a 10-gene signature (AURKB, CENPI, DEPDC1, DEPDC1B, FAM83D, FGD3, NCAPH, DLGAP, KIF2C, VAV3) derived from those by Yao and colleagues. The results, shown in the figure below, demonstrate that Bria-IMT™ most closely clusters with MDA-MB-468 and as such is considered a grade II “moderately differentiated” cell line.

Based on a recent publication of patients with relapsed breast cancer, we estimate that this will account for ~40% of relapsed metastatic breast cancer cases (33% grade II and 7% grade I) (Sundquist M, Brudin L, Tejler G. Improved survival in metastatic breast cancer 1985-2016. Breast. 2017 Feb;31:46-50. doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2016.10.005. Epub 2016 Nov 2). In patients with relapsed disease, the overall survival following relapse appears similar for those with grade II and grade III tumors.9 The market for breast cancer drugs is a multibillion-dollar market with new drugs being approved on an ongoing basis, indicating the shortage of safe and effective treatments for this deadly disease. Figure A summarizes current drugs on the market utilized in combination therapy along with their reported market sales, which further supports market potential for Bria-IMT™ to be used for combination therapy for breast cancer patients.
 
We propose the following calculation in order to show the rationale behind the number of patients that we anticipate can be currently treated by SV-BR-1-GM:
 

● | There are 150,000 women with metastatic breast cancer in the U.S.10 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ~45% will receive third line therapy11 = 68,000 patients available 
● | 68,000 x 50% (matched for 1 HLA allele group)12 = 34,000 patients available for treatment13 
● | 40% have grade I/II tumors14 = 13,600 patients available for treatment

Competition
 
Currently available therapeutic options for breast cancer offer some hope for patients, but there is much room for improvement. Comparable studies looking primarily at second line or later treatment are shown in Table “A”, below. Evaluating response rates (partial and complete responses = ORR), progression free survival (“PFS”) and overall survival (“OS”) from clinical trials in similar subjects with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer indicate that response rates range from 6.9% up to 59%, depending on the population studied and the intervention (median 24%). PFS ranges from 8 weeks to 12 months (median 5 months) and OS from 6 months to 31 months (median 13 months).
 
Table A: Studies evaluating second-line or later treatment options. Data depict an unpredictable response rate to treatment ranging from 6.9-59%, therefore establishing and confirming the opportunity for Bria-IMT™.

MBC treated with second or higher lines of therapy has a very poor prognosis and few effective therapies that consistently induce long-term remission,29 which indicates the market demand and clinical need for new and improved therapeutic drugs and treatment options in order to improve these response outcomes and patient survival rates. Thus, Bria-IMT™ has the potential to induce long-term remission, especially in combination with immunotherapies. Current treatment of MBC is outlined in Figure “B”, below, which illustrates different therapeutic treatment options and drugs used upon diagnoses from biopsy and identification of breast cancer biomarkers.30

Figure B: Current treatment paradigm for metastatic breast cancer including between different treatment strategies and combination therapies dependent upon biomarker identification and activity within the breast cancer signaling pathway.
 

Of patients treated with trastuzumab for MBC, one study showed that 241/331 (72%) progressed within 27 months (32% per year) with median survival of 13-14 months (CI 10-15 months).31 This indicates the high unmet need in this patient population which should facilitate regulatory review of novel therapies such as Bria-IMT™.
 
While there are approximately 36 different biotech companies working to create an effective breast cancer vaccine, a significant gap remains in the effectiveness and safety of second or higher lines of therapy. The most studied targeted immunotherapy, Neuvax (Galena), a HER2 peptide vaccine, failed a Phase III trial, but there is encouraging data to support at least three ongoing clinical trials combining trastuzumab with HER2 epitope immunogens.32 The National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) randomized trial adding PANVAC (a poxviral-based immunogen) to docetaxel increased the median PFS from 3.9 months to 7.9 months and is to be used as a basis for larger, more sophisticated clinical trials.33 An immunogen targeting a carbohydrate antigen, globo-H, was associated with improved PFS, but only in the subset able to mount antibody responses.34 A Johns Hopkins breast cancer trial using a breast cancer cell line transfected with the gene for GM-CSF has not been positive but, using the same cell line with trastuzumab, 40% of patients enjoyed clinical benefit (CR+PR+stable) at one year.35 Finally, the study of targeted cancer immunotherapies in combination with other therapies is receiving much attention, particularly combination with checkpoint inhibitors.36

There are several other approaches to developing targeted breast cancer immunotherapies. These include using peptide cocktails, a triple peptide regimen, recombinant HER2, antigen-pulsed dendritic cells, DNA immunogens, whole cell allogeneic GM-CSF secreting SKBR3 or T47D cells, an (HLA)-A2/A3-restricted immunogenic peptide derived from the HER2 protein, oxidized mannan-MUC1, and personalized peptide immunogens.
 
Among the most promising results in patients with advanced disease have been using whole-cell preparations, particularly if the cells are engineered to express GM-CSF. We are taking this approach and capitalizing on positive initial results with Bria-IMT™ monotherapy in difficult to treat patients using a regimen that both limits regulatory T cell activity (using low dose cyclophosphamide pre-treatment) and boosts the immune response (using post-dose alpha interferon in the inoculation sites). The combination with PD-1 inhibitors is a logical extension of our findings where 21 of 23 MBC patients had demonstrable PD-L1 expression on the circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) and/or circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (“CAMLs”). The overall strategy, once the initial milestones have been met, to enroll additional patients for product registration, will allow rapid progression of the best therapeutic option to a Biologics License Application (“BLA”).
 
Products/Pipeline
 
Bria-IMT™
 
Bria-IMT™, BriaCell’s lead candidate, is a whole-cell immunotherapy undergoing clinical testing in patients with MBC who have failed prior lines of therapy. BriaCell has been conducting a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of Bria-IMT™, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®; manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.). The combination study is listed in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03328026 under FDA-approved BB-IND 10312 under protocol BRI-ROL-001 at three clinical sites: St. Joseph Heritage Healthcare in Santa Rosa, California, United States; University of Miami/Sylvester at Plantation, in Plantation, Florida, USA; Cancer Center of Kansas, in Wichita, Kansas, USA. Subsequent to the establishment of a collaboration with Incyte Corporation, this study has been modified to evaluate the combination of the Bria-IMT™ with retifanlimab (also referred to as INCMGA00012 ,a PD-1 inhibitor).
 
BriaCell has achieved proof of concept based on data from a Phase I/IIa study of Bria-IMT™ in advanced breast cancer patients. In essence, BriaCell obtained evidence that patients with certain HLA molecules also present in Bria-IMT™ have a higher likelihood of responding to the Bria-IMT™ regimen with tumor regression (“shrinkage”), which is consistent with results from a molecular analysis of Bria-IMT™ conducted by BriaCell.

● | Bria-IMT™ has been evaluated in a regimen including pre-dose low-dose cyclophosphamide (to reduce immune suppression), intradermal inoculation with 20-50 million irradiated Bria-IMT™ cells between two and three days later, with subsequent intradermal inoculation with interferon-α2 approximately two and four days later. This is known as the Bria-IMT™ regimen. Both were single arm studies, so there were no untreated patients for comparison.

● | There were four evaluable patients treated in one study (Study SVMC #01-026) and 23 evaluable patients treated in another study (Study WRI-GEV-007) with this regimen with cycles every two weeks for the first month and then monthly. They were heavily pre-treated with a median of four prior systemic therapy regimens. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The data shows an outstanding safety and tolerability profile for Bria-IMT™ in advanced breast cancer patients. 
● | In the SVMC #01-026 study, treatment was limited to six cycles over five months. Four post-menopausal white women were enrolled aged between 58.7 and 73 years. Three had breast cancer and one had Her2+ ovarian cancer. All had failed at least one prior systemic therapy. 


● | These patients received between four and six cycles of treatment on protocol. One patient had an additional 13 cycles off protocol.

● | The only adverse events that occurred in more than one patient were itch and rash at the inoculation sites. No deaths were reported during this study. There were four serious adverse events (“SAEs”) in 3 patients with one (transient urticaria, grade 3) judged probably related to treatment. All SAEs were manageable with community practice therapies. 
● | The Bria-IMT™ regimen was able to elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity (“DTH”) responses in all patients. DTH is a measure of cell-mediated immunity. This response involves the interaction of T-cells, monocytes, and macrophages. This reaction is caused when CD4+ Th1 helper T cells recognize foreign antigen in a complex with the Class II HLA molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. These can be macrophages or dendritic cells that secrete monokines such as IL-12 and IL-15, which stimulates the proliferation of additional CD4+ Th1 cells. CD4+ T cells secrete other cytokines including IL-2 and interferon gamma, inducing the further release of other Th1 cytokines, thus mediating the immune response. This results also in the activation of CD8+ T cells which destroy target cells on contact, and activated macrophages which produce hydrolytic enzymes.

● | One patient (A002) had a partial response with regression of breast lesions, resolution of lung and soft tissue lesions, and improvement of stability of bone lesions. She completed therapy and 3 months after her last Bria-IMT™ inoculation, imaging studies identified regrowth of tumor notably in the breast, lung, and brain. After consultation with the FDA, the patient was treated off-protocol which also produced tumor regression, including the resolution of brain metastases. The HLA-DRB3 allele of patient A002 matched with that of SV-BR-1-GM and the HLA-DRB1 allele of patient A002 also matched that of SV-BR-1-GM. Her tumor was grade II (moderately differentiated). One other patient on this study (B001) with a grade II tumor had disease limited to bony metastases. She did not have measurable disease but was felt to progress on study.

● | Median time to tumor progression was 144 days (range 64 – 223 days) for the initial round of treatment. Overall survival was more than 33 months in all patients except B001 (7 months). 


● | In the WRI-GEV-007 study, patients were treated with a median of three cycles of therapy (range 1-8). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Bria-IMT™ regimen was able to elicit both cellular immune responses (as evidenced by DTH responses in 85% of patients evaluated) and antibody responses (present in 58% of patients evaluated). 


● | The most common adverse events seen were local irritation at the inoculation sites. There was one serious adverse event of gastrointestinal reflux disease possibly related to Bria-IMT™.

● | Several patients showed evidence of anti-tumor activity of the Bria-IMT™ regimen in spite of their being heavily pre-treated advanced breast cancer patients. Specifically, one patient (designated 01-002) had regression or disappearance of 20 lung metastases, but stable disease in liver metastases (as the liver metastases were the target lesions, she did not qualify as a partial response). She displayed a robust DTH response, had a grade I tumor and matched Bria-IMT™ at 2 HLA loci. One patient (05-002) had a reduction in the size of a breast lesion but progression of a liver lesion and did not meet criteria for a partial response. She also displayed a robust DTH response, had a grade II tumor and matched Bria-IMT™ at 2 HLA loci. One patient (01-005) had a marked reduction in cutaneous involvement but developed restrictive cardiomyopathy (unrelated to study drug) with subsequent mortality. She had a grade III (poorly differentiated) tumor and matched Bria-IMT™ at one HLA locus. She was not on study long enough to be evaluated for her response. 
● | Patients 01-002, 05-002 and 01-005 who showed objective evidence of tumor shrinkage all matched the Bria-IMT™ cell line at least at one HLA locus and all had evidence of DTH responses to Bria-IMT™ and/or the parent cell line (SV-BR-1 – the breast cancer cell line from which Bria-IMT™ was derived). Patients who did not develop a DTH response did not show evidence of tumor shrinkage. 
● | Patients 01-002 and 05-002 had grade I/II tumors. Both of them also had two HLA matches with Bria-IMT™. Two other patients with grade II tumors (patient 03-001 and 06-001) had stable disease on the study and were also considered to have received clinical benefit from the treatment. (Clinical benefit was defined as some evidence of tumor shrinkage (including a mixed response with shrinkage of some tumors but progression of others, as for 05-002) with over 90 days on study; or as stable disease, a partial response or a complete response as per RECIST criteria). Neither 03-001 or 06-001 had HLA matches with Bria-IMT™, suggesting that HLA matching may not be required for clinical benefit in patients with grade I/II tumors. Thus, four of the six patients with grade I/II tumors exhibited clinical benefit. One of the remaining patients showed no evidence of an immune response as evaluated by DTH. Thus, four of the five grade I/II patients able to develop an immune response, as noted by DTH, exhibited clinical benefit. 
● | These preliminary data indicate that the Bria-IMT™ regimen in advanced breast cancer patients is well tolerated, able to elicit an immune response and able to induce reduction in tumor burden.

● | Another phase I/IIa study (BRI-ROL-001) was initiated evaluating the combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). This combination combines the induction of an immune response by Bria-IMT™ (i.e. “putting the foot on the gas” of the immune response) with the ability of KEYTRUDA® to block the PD-1 – PD-L1 immune checkpoint (i.e. to “take the foot off the brakes” of the immune response). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Eleven patients with advanced breast cancer (median of four prior systemic therapy regimens) have been treated with this regimen with cycles every three weeks for a median of three cycles (range 1 – 9 cycles). 
● | Two patients had evidence of tumor regression, both of whom had robust immune responses (as measured by DTH) to Bria-IMT™. Both of them had grade II tumors. One matched Bria-IMT™ at two HLA types (06-005) while the other did not match Bria-IMT™ at any HLA types (06-001, who “rolled over” from the WRI-GEV-007 study where she had stable disease), suggesting that the Bria-IMT™ regimen, when given in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, may be able to induce tumor regression without an HLA match especially in patients with grade I/II tumors. One additional patient (06-004) in this study had a grade II tumor and was noted to have stable disease. The other seven patients treated had grade III tumors (poorly differentiated). Thus, all three of the patients with grade I/II tumors showed evidence of clinical benefit. 
● | Following the establishment of a collaboration with Incyte Corporation, this study is being altered to evaluate the combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with INCMGA00012 (anti-PD-1 antibody similar to KEYTRUDA®) and epacadostat (inhibitor of IDO, which suppresses the immune response). The combination with KEYTRUDA® has been discontinued but may be resumed in other studies. 
● | The data confirms the “HLA Matching Hypothesis” and supports BriaCell’s strategy for the development of Bria-OTS™, BriaCell’s first personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapy for advanced breast cancer. 

 
About Bria-IMT™
 
Developed and characterized by a team of dedicated scientists and clinicians, Bria-IMT™ (SV-BR-1-GM) is a targeted immunotherapy being developed for the treatment of breast cancer. Bria-IMT™ is a genetically engineered human breast cancer cell line with features of immune cells and clinically applied as a targeted immunotherapy.
 
In short, Bria-IMT™ immunotherapy is a genetically engineered human breast cancer cell line derived from a grade II tumor which activates the immune system to attack and destroy breast cancer tumors.
 
Mechanism of Action of Bria-IMT™
 
The mechanism of action of Bria-IMT™ is currently under investigation. It is likely that the expression of certain breast cancer antigens (proteins expressed in breast cancer cells) in Bria-IMT™ generates strong T cell and potentially antibody responses – resulting in recognition and destruction of cancerous cells.37
 
Bria-IMT™ is designed to secrete GM-CSF, a factor that stimulates components of the immune system. Specifically, GM-CSF activates dendritic cells, the cells that start immune responses. These activated dendritic cells then activate T cells, a key component of the immune system, to recognize the tumor cells as foreign, and eliminate them. To amplify this action, we have combined Bria-IMT™ with other immune system activators including cyclophosphamide (used in low doses to reduce immune suppression), and interferon-α, a cytokine that further activates the immune system. We believe this approach of simultaneous activation of the immune system via different pathways will improve the immune system response to attack and destroy cancer cells.

Bria-OTS™
 
Using BriaCell’s novel technology platform and our strong research and development capabilities, BriaCell plans to develop Bria-OTS™, a personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapy for breast cancer, and similar immunotherapy cell lines for other cancer indications.
 

● | Bria-OTS™ is under development as an off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy for advanced breast cancer. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The concept for Bria-OTS™ comes from BriaCell’s work with Bria-IMT™, where BriaCell noted that if a patient “matches” Bria-IMT™ in their HLA type, they were more likely to respond. 
● | HLA molecules are the molecules that start immune responses but are polymorphic – i.e. they are different in different people, although some people will share the same HLA molecules (referred to as HLA alleles or HLA types). 
● | Bria-OTS™ is made from cell lines that are genetically engineered to expresses the immune boosters GM-CSF and interferon-α, as well as specific HLA types (a.k.a. alleles). 
● | Different cell lines are being pre-manufactured to express different HLA types covering >99% of the overall breast cancer patient population. 


● | Using the BriaDX™, a companion diagnostic test performed on the patient’s saliva, the suitable personalized treatment will be selected for each patient for administration. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | This approach allows personalized treatment without the need for personalized manufacturing. Additionally, it saves time, and skips expensive and complicated manufacturing procedures associated with other personalized treatments. 
● | Bria-OTS™ cell lines are being engineered and transferred to good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) production in 2022 and commencing clinical evaluation in 2022 (expected authorization by FDA and expected first patient to be dosed in 2022) with safety and efficacy data expected to be released during 2022 and 2023. 

 
BriaDx™
 
BriaDx™ is a diagnostic test that BriaCell is developing to identify the patients most likely to respond to Bria-IMT™. Currently, BriaDx™ includes HLA typing of the patients, as patients having HLA alleles also present in Bria-IMT™ appear to have a higher likelihood of responding to the Bria-IMT™ regimen with tumor shrinkage. Additional markers of potential diagnostic use are being developed based on the expression of specific biomarkers in the responder (i.e. biomarkers which identify the patients for which Bria-IMT™ immunotherapy appears more effective) vs the non-responder patients from clinical studies of Bria-IMT™ in advanced breast cancer patients.
 
Blood and tumor samples from the patients are analyzed using cutting-edge technologies including gene expression analysis and assessment of the levels of antibodies predicted to bind to Bria-IMTTM.
 
The insights gained from biomarker studies conducted to date have provided us with a solid basis for the development of Bria-OTS™, an off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy which would match over 99% of patients with advanced breast cancer.

BriaDx™ is being developed to help understand which patients are most likely to respond to Bria-IMT™ targeted immunotherapy. Based on the proposed mechanism of action of Bria-IMT™, HLA molecules play a key role inducing cellular immune responses to Bria-IMT™ which boosts the patient’s immune response to their cancer.
 
HLA molecules are polymorphic, in that they are different in different individuals, but shared by some individuals (similar to eye color). Based on our clinical data to date, we hypothesize that patients with HLA alleles also present in Bria-IMT™ have a higher likelihood of responding to the Bria-IMT™ regimen with tumor regression. Therefore, BriaDx™, a companion diagnostic test, determines the patients’ HLA types.
 
Available Clinical Data for Treatment with the Bria-IMT™ Regimen
 
BriaCell conducted three Proof of Concept clinical trials, one using parental SV-BR-1 cells and the other two using Bria-IMT™ (i.e. genetically engineered SV-BR-1 cells – producing GM-CSF also called SV-BR-1-GM), in metastatic (i.e. Stage IV) breast cancer patients who had failed prior treatments. The patients were treated with the Bria-IMT™ regimen according to the following schedule, and the results are summarized below.
 
Treatment schedule:
 

● | Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 intravenously 2-3 days prior to Bria-IMT™ inoculation 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Bria-IMT™ 20 million irradiated cells given intradermally split into 4 inoculations (2 in the upper back and 2 in the thighs) 
● | Interferon alpha-2b 10,000 units into each inoculation site 2 and 4 days after the Bria-IMT™ inoculations 
● | Treatment cycles every 2 weeks for four weeks (3 inoculations) then every month.

First Proof of Concept Trial
 

● | Used unmodified cell line (parental SV-BR-1 cells) + GM-CSF + cyclophosphamide. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | N = 14 late stage, treatment-refractory breast cancer patients. 
● | No significant adverse treatment-associated events, well tolerated. 
● | Median Overall Survival = 12.1 months. 

Second Proof of Concept Trial
 

● | Used Bria-IMT™ (i.e. genetically engineered SV-BR-1 cells – producing GM-CSF) with pre-dose, low dose cyclophosphamide and post-dose local interferon-α to boost the response (the Bria-IMT™ regimen) with cycles every two weeks for four weeks (three inoculations) then monthly up to a total of six cycles. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | N = 4 late stage, treatment-refractory (3 breast cancer (2 grade II and 1 grade III), and 1 ovarian cancer) patients. 
● | No significant adverse treatment-associated events, well tolerated. 
● | Median Overall Survival = 35 months. 
● | One robust responder with greater than 90% regression during treatment and a subsequent relapse (upon halting treatment) responded to re-treatment. 
● | This patient matched Bria-IMT™ at a key HLA type (HLA-DR) and had a grade II tumor. 

Third Proof of Concept Trial
 
Thirty patients were screened, 24 enrolled and 23 dosed in the Phase I/IIa study (2017-2018).
 

● | The Bria-IMT™ regimen included pre-dose low-dose cyclophosphamide (to reduce immune suppression), intradermal inoculation with 20-50 million irradiated Bria-IMT™ cells between two and three days later, with subsequent intradermal inoculation with interferon-α2b approximately two and four days later. The majority of adverse events (“AEs”) were limited to expected minor local irritation at the injection sites. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The 23 patients treated with this regimen received cycles every two weeks for the first month and then monthly. They were heavily pre-treated with a median of four prior systemic therapy regimens. 
● | Patients were treated with a median of three cycles of therapy (range 1-8). 
● | The Bria-IMT™ regimen was able to elicit both cellular immune responses (as evidenced by DTH responses in 85% of patients evaluated) and antibody responses (present in 58% of patients evaluated). 
● | There were no serious, unexpected, drug-related AEs. 

 
Most patients who withdrew from the trial did so due to the worsening of their underlying disease. Specifically, 14 patients terminated participation due to progressive disease, four withdrew, three terminated participation due to mortality (unrelated to study drug), and two terminated participation due to adverse events (both judged unrelated to study drug).
 
In the combined experience of the second and third studies (which both use the same Bria-IMT™ regimen), disease control (i.e. stable disease or partial response) was evaluated.

● | Disease control was seen in four of twenty patients who match with Bria-IMT™ at one or more HLA locus, including in three of six patients who match Bria-IMT™ at two or more HLA loci, further supporting our “HLA Matching Hypothesis”, and the development of Bria-OTS ™ to single match over 99% and double match approximately 90% of the patient population. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Effectiveness also depends on the ability of the patient to develop an immune response to Bria-IMT™, as measured by DTH to the Bria-IMT™ or to the parental cell line (SV-BR-1). Across both “monotherapy” studies (SVMC #01-026 and WRI-GEV-007), a positive DTH response was noted in 22 patients while five were not responsive. 
● | Results are shown in the tables below, combining the second and third proof of concept studies, both of which used Bria-IMT™ in an identical regimen.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Bria-IMT™ has been very well tolerated (over 100 doses given to date). 
● | Tumor regression was seen in patients who were able to mount an immune response and matched Bria-IMT™ at HLA types, confirming our main hypothesis and supporting using HLA typing as a marker to predict who is most likely to respond. 
● | BriaCell continues to monitor their clinical trials, proposing that BriaDx™ would include HLA typing as well as other potential biomarkers (such as tumour grade or the ability to mount a DTH response) to identify the patients most likely to respond to the Bria-IMT™ regimen.

Protein Kinase C Delta (PKCδ) Inhibitors
 
Overview
 
The delta isoform of the Protein Kinase C family (PKCδ) is implicated in a multitude of cellular responses to external and internal stimuli, playing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. In contrast to PKCα, PKCδ does not seem to be required for survival of normal cells. In PKCδ knockout mice, mild lymphoproliferation was observed, but overall, PKCδ inhibition is well tolerated at the organismal level. BriaCell scientists develop small-molecule PKCδ inhibitors for use in those situations where PKCδ carries out pro-tumorigenic functions. Preliminary data suggest that PKCδ inhibition may be particularly beneficial in a subset of cancers with oncogenic Ras or with otherwise activated Ras signaling, for instance in endometrial cancers with estrogen-induced K-Ras stabilization. In particular, PKCδ inhibition may be of therapeutic use in cancers dependent on Ras signaling for proliferation, as shown in vitro for lung cancer. BriaCell, through our subsidiary Sapientia, uses structural information of Rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor with modest activity, and Staurosporine, a potent but nonspecific PKC inhibitor, to develop a series of “hybrid” compounds. This rational design approach is envisioned to yield molecules with, compared to Rottlerin, enhanced activity yet retained PKC δ-selectivity.
Strategy and Results
 
PKCδ inhibition was achieved with small molecules using a pharmacophore model based on Staurosporine and Rottlerin. One of the most promising molecules based on this approach, BC106 (BJE6-106), presents an IC50 for PKCδ inhibition of approximately 50 nM and is approximately 1000-fold more selective for PKCδ than for PKCα. In cellular and animal model studies, BC106 shows effective anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity, but this molecule is not water soluble, hence not appropriate as a drug candidate. Efforts to improve water solubility have been initiated, with a series of compounds undergoing testing in in vitro kinase and cell-based assays.
 
To develop PKCδ inhibitors, BriaCell affiliates started with two molecules known to have PKC-inhibitory properties: Staurosporine and Rottlerin. Multiple chemical manipulations and testing resulted in BC106, one of the Company’s most effective compounds to-date. Staurosporine is a well-known PKC inhibitor with anti-cancer activity, while Rottlerin, also known as Mallotoxin, opens potassium channels that have been used to induce apoptosis. Rottlerin has also been shown to be an immunosuppressive agent, affecting multiple oncogenic pathways. Although some reports claim that Rottlerin does not act primarily via PKCδ inhibition, BriaCell’s data supports Rottlerin-derived molecules as viable tumor suppressors.
 
The Company’s strategy for compound synthesis is based on a hitherto unexplored design concept, wherein functional moieties of two natural products known to strongly inhibit PKCδ – Rottlerin and Staurosporine – have been “intellectually cut” from each natural product and then covalently joined to make a novel, chimeric scaffold. The Company’s synthetic analogs, in essence, combine the bottom benzopyran moiety of Rottlerin and chemically join that to the indolyl carbazole moiety of Staurosporine. Further, new chimeric scaffolds are synthesized in a novel, convergent modular fashion, allowing for the rapid assembly and testing of many derivatives.
 
Rottlerin was initially used because this molecule inhibits purified PKCδ at an IC50 of 3-5 μM in vitro, and in cultured cells with an IC50 of 5 μM. Rottlerin is relatively more selective for PKCδ than for PKCα (PKCδ IC50:PKCα IC50 ≈ 1:30). BriaCell further advanced our pharmacophore model using the Rottlerin-based prototype chimeric structure in combination with Staurosporine by incorporating protein structural data for the novel class PKCs. This strategy produced a second generation of PKCδ inhibitors with the “head” group resembling that of Staurosporine and the other domains conserved from the Rottlerin scaffold to preserve isozyme specificity. A second generation successful product is represented by BC128, which has an IC50 of 4 μM for PKCδ (similar to Rottlerin), and better isozyme selectivity (IC50 of >120 μM for PKCα). BC128 showed anti-tumor cell activity in vitro and in vivo.

BC106, BriaCell’s most-recent “lead” compound, produces substantial cytotoxicity against multiple human tumor lines at nM concentrations (10-40 times lower than Rottlerin or BC128). BC106 dramatically inhibited the clonogenic capacity of RAS-mut tumor cell lines after as little as 12 hours of exposure. BC106 is 1000-fold more selective for PKCδ than for PKCα. The latter is an important finding because inhibition of PKCα is generally toxic to all cells (normal and malignant) and would make BC106 non-tumor-targeted.
 
Approximately 40% of melanomas harbor NRAS mutations and there is no effective RAS-targeted treatment available for this subgroup. BriaCell affiliates have demonstrated that NRAS-mutant melanoma cells were highly sensitive to PKCδ siRNA knock-down and to BC106 at nM concentrations. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that irreversible inhibition of proliferation required as little as 12 hours of exposure to Rottlerin or BC106.
 
BriaCell affiliates also assessed the effects of PKCδ inhibition on breast tumor growth and survival in a xenograft human breast cancer stem cell model. PKCδ inhibition prevented tumor grown and promoted the survival of the animals evaluated over the course of 300 days (note that the vehicle treated animals all died within the first 20 days of the study).
 
Furthermore, PKCδ inhibition also inhibited the growth of neuroendocrine cells.
 
Summary and Outlook – Early Stage Preclinical Program
 

● | Thirty percent of all human malignancies display activating RAS mutations, with another 60% showing over-activity of Ras-signaling pathways.38 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | BriaCell’s novel, proprietary PKCδ inhibitors have shown activity against multiple RAS transformed tumors.39 
● | This target has an attractive safety profile based on in vivo studies and knock out mouse studies.40 
● | PKCδ also has potential activity as an immunotherapeutic by blocking TGFβ signaling.41 
● | PKCδ inhibitors are applicable to specific niche tumor types which provide an accelerated clinical development plan. 
● | Structural aspects of first-generation inhibitor rottlerin and staurosporine ([a] pan-PKC inhibitor) were combined to create second generation inhibitor KAM1. 
● | Third generation inhibitors such as BC-106 have improved potency and selectivity. 
● | Fourth generation inhibitors are under development to optimize their drug-like characteristics. 
● | PKCδ inhibitors lack endothelial cell cytotoxicity, while PKCδ deficient mice develop normally and are fertile. This shows that there is no marked intrinsic toxicity as a result of inhibiting PKCδ.
● | Candidate selection is anticipated in 2022.

Early Phase Programs
 
BriaCell is developing multi-specific binding reagents that simultaneously bind to an immune cell and a cancer cell, or just to a cancer cell, and activate the immune system against the cancer cells. The novel binding reagents are designed to act, among others, as potent immune cell activators/immune checkpoint inhibitors without the toxicity of current checkpoint inhibitors. The expected effect is a highly targeted therapy envisioned to selectively destroy cancer cells without affecting normal (i.e. non-cancerous) cells. This may mean less severe side effects for the treated cancer patients compared to alternative therapies. The Company cautions that these novel therapeutics are still in early-stage research and development and is not making any express or implied claims as to their success in cancer treatment or commercial viability. The patent application seeks protection for, among others, the design of new therapeutics and methods for their use. These are designated “Bria-TILs-Rx”. IND filings for Bria-TILs-Rx for the treatment of prostate cancer and epithelial and glandular cancer, respectively, are anticipated to be made in 2022 and require an additional cost of approximately US$1,000,000 each.
 
On October 28, 2020, BriaCell entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the NCI. Under the CRADA, NCI and BriaCell will work together to conduct preclinical studies to develop and test BriaCell’s proprietary Bria-OTS cellular immunotherapy as a treatment for cancer, to improve and broaden applicability of this therapeutic strategy. Under the terms of the CRADA, BriaCell will provide funding (totaling $433,400 over three years) to support the project. The NCI estimates that 1.3 person-years of effort per year will be required to complete the CRADA research, which includes the development of a mouse model of this therapeutic strategy. BriaCell and NCI will be using their combined expertise in tumor immunology, molecular biology and development of cellular therapies to design studies which are intended to trigger the immunologic pathways necessary to create potent immune responses against cancer. The goal of the collaboration is to develop novel therapeutics for future clinical collaborations, allowing cancer patients to potentially benefit from potent and personalized cancer immunotherapy.
 
Mechanism of Action of Bria-IMT™ and Bria-OTS™4
 
The mechanism of action of Bria-IMT™/Bria-OTS™ is currently under investigation.
 

21
--


We believe that Bria-IMT™/Bria-OTS™ activates the patient’s immune system to recognize tumor cells and destroy them. We hypothesize that Bria-IMT™/Bria-OTS™ exerts its action via the patient’s antigen-presentation system (i.e. the system that presents antigen material on the surface of cells for recognition by the T cells of the immune system as either self (i.e. safe) or foreign (i.e. to be destroyed)). Specifically, Bria-IMT™/Bria-OTS is thought to stimulate dendritic cells, a key component of the antigen-presenting system, to display certain immunogenic (i.e. immune response-generating) protein fragments to T cells, which activates the T cells to destroy the tumor cells either directly, or indirectly by inducing a humoral (i.e. antibody-generating) immune response. In addition, we also have shown that Bria-IMT™ is capable of directly stimulating T cells, thereby potentially adding additional therapeutic benefits. The latter property of Bria-IMT™ is the basis of the Bria-OTS™ project as it requires HLA matching between the therapeutic cells and the patient.42
 
BriaCell’s preliminary analyses have shown several up-regulated genes in Bria-IMT™ that encode proteins known to be immunogenic (i.e. immune response-generating), suggesting that Bria-IMT™ can stimulate the immune system against the cancer cells.
 
Bria-IMT™ is a human breast cancer cell line which expresses Her2/neu (a protein well known for its overexpression in breast cancer but also associated other epithelial malignancies, including ovarian, pancreatic, colon, bladder and prostate cancers). Bria-IMT™ has been engineered to produce and secrete GM-CSF, a protein that promotes dendritic cell function, a key component of the immune system, and hence activates the immune system.


Potential Mechanisms of Specific Immune Activation in Advanced Breast Cancer
 

1. | Bria-IMT/OTS™ produces breast cancer antigens (i.e. proteins made by breast cancer cells). 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Bria-IMT/OTS™ secretes GM-CSF, which further promotes dendritic cell-based antigen presentation (i.e. boosts the response). 
3. | Breast cancer antigens are taken up by dendritic cells and “presented” to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells implicated in tumor destruction. 
4. | Bria-IMT/OTS™ directly stimulates cancer fighting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (i.e. further boosts the response). 
5. | Bria-IMT/OTS™ biological activity depends on HLA matching of Bria-IMT/OTS™ and the patient. 

Clinical Trials
 
Phase I/IIA Combination Study of Bria-IMT™ with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Advanced Breast Cancer
 
The FDA approved the combination study of Bria-IMT™ with immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced breast cancer (third line or later). The initial study used pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, purchased by the Company as the Company does not have an agreement with Merck for the supply of KEYTRUDA®). The Company dosed 11 patients with this combination and no dose limiting toxicities were observed. Additionally, evidence of additive or synergistic activity was observed.
 
The combination with KEYTRUDA® was discontinued and the study was subsequently modified to use a combination of Bria-IMT with the Incyte PD-1 inhibitor retifanlimab (INCMGA00012). The Company anticipates additional safety and efficacy data for the combination of Bria-IMT™ with INCMGA00012 to be released throughout 2022 and 2023.

For the year ended July 31, 2022, research costs amounted to $8,021,489 as compared to $2,020,899 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The increase is attributed to the recommencing of the Company’s clinical trials and the increased activity in the lab, including the hiring of additional lab employees.
 
We may face difficulties recruiting or retaining patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials if patients are affected by the virus or are fearful of visiting or traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the outbreak of COVID-19. In the event that clinical trial sites are slowed down or closed to enrollment in our trials, this could have a material adverse impact on our clinical trial plans and timelines. We are continuing to assess our business plans and the impact COVID-19 is having on our clinical trial timelines and our ability to recruit candidates for clinical trials, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular. The extent to which COVID-19 and global efforts to contain its spread will impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus outbreak. We currently believe that the execution of our clinical trials and research programs will be delayed by at least one quarter due to COVID-19.
 
One patient transitioned from combined treatment of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with KEYTRUDA® to combination treatment with retifanlimab. She has continued to have stable disease, with further reduction in the size of some of her breast cancer nodules around the brain, including disappearance of one nodule behind the left eye which was causing proptosis (i.e. pushing the eye forward). This nodule has completely disappeared and her eye has gone back into place.
 
Rationale for the Combination Study of Bria-IMT™ with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, have come to the forefront in the fight against cancer, with substantial benefits for some patients. Recently, the significance of immune checkpoint inhibitors was recognized by the Nobel committee by awarding Dr. Tasuku Honjo and Dr. James P. Allison with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (scientists behind game-changing cancer immunotherapies win Nobel medicine prize), validating the Company’s decision to initiate a combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Drs. Allison and Honjo independently, using different strategies, showed a new approach of treating patients by awakening certain cells of the immune system, T cells, to attack tumors. This new approach of treating patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as anti-PD-1 antibodies), designed to overcome immune suppression in cancer patients, is revolutionizing the fight against cancer.
 
In 2010, a pre-clinical study by Dr. Allison’s research group showed that combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies potentiated the tumor-destroying effect of melanoma cells engineered to produce GM-CSF, a substance that activates the immune system, compared to the treatment with the GM-CSF producing cells alone. Bria-IMT™, a breast cancer cell line, also produces GM-CSF. Bria-IMT™ has been shown to indirectly and directly stimulate T cells, and hence has displayed immune-activating properties. BriaCell has published these findings in a leading immunology journal. It is important to note that anti-PD-1 antibodies have not been shown to work on their own in breast cancer.
 
KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)
 
Manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is a prescription medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with the immune system. It has been approved for the treatment of a number of cancer indications, excluding breast cancer. The company is not a party to any agreements with Merck for the supply of KEYTRUDA®.

● | A phase I/IIa study was performed evaluating the combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). This combination combines the induction of an immune response by Bria-IMT™ (putting the foot on the gas of the immune response) with the ability of KEYTRUDA® to block the PD-1 – PD-L1 immune checkpoint (i.e. taking the foot off the brakes of the immune response). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Eleven patients with advanced breast cancer (with a median of four prior systemic therapy regimens) were treated with this regimen, with cycles every three weeks for a median of three cycles each (range: 1 – 9 cycles). 
● | Two patients had evidence of tumor regression, both of whom had grade II tumors and also had robust immune responses (as measured by DTH) to Bria-IMT™. One matched Bria-IMT™ at two HLA types while the other did not match Bria-IMT™ at any HLA types, suggesting that the Bria-IMT™ regimen, when given in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, may be able to induce tumor regression without an HLA match, especially in patients with grade I/II tumors. One other patient in this cohort had a grade II tumor and that patient had stable disease. Thus, of the three patients with grade I/II tumors treated with the combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with pembrolizumab, all three showed evidence of a clinical benefit, as typically defined in clinical research. BriaCell purchased the KEYTRUDA® for this study without a collaboration with Merck while pursuing other avenues to collaborate with a company that has an anti-PD-1 antibody and/or other immune checkpoint inhibitors to use in combination with the Bria-IMT™ regimen. BriaCell has obtained such an agreement with Incyte Corporation as noted below. Based on this, the combination therapy study (BRI-ROL-001) had been amended to evaluate combination of the Bria-IMT™ regimen with Incyte’s PD-1 inhibitor as noted below. The combination with KEYTRUDA® has been discontinued. 

BriaCell & Incyte Collaboration and Supply Agreement
 
The following summarizes the non-exclusive clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the effects of combinations of novel clinical candidates:
 

● | The clinical study focuses on BriaCell’s lead candidate, Bria-IMT™, in combination with Incyte’s retifanlimab, for treatment of advanced breast cancer. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Incyte is providing retifanlimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, for use in combination studies with BriaCell’s lead candidate, Bria-IMT™. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Incyte is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics in oncology and other serious diseases. 
● | The first twelve patients will receive the Bria-IMT™ regimen in combination with retifanlimab. Once safety of the combination has been established, an expansion cohort of 24 subjects will be evaluated. This expansion cohort will be limited to patients who match Bria-IMT™ at one or more HLA alleles and/or have Grade I/II disease. 
● | Dosing of the novel combinations commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is ongoing. 
● | The Company anticipates safety and efficacy data to be released during 2022 and 2023. 
● | Pending discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), a registration study focused on, but not limited to, Bria-IMT™, in combination with Incyte’s selected compounds for advanced breast cancer, is planned to commence in late 2022 or early 2023 with the Bria-OTS™ program following by approximately 8-10 quarters.

Additional data was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research San Antonio Breast Cancer Meeting on December 10-11, 2020. The data presented summarized the clinical and pathological data of the Bria-IMT™ monotherapy (i.e. the Bria-IMT™ regimen alone) study and the Phase I/IIa clinical study of Bria-IMT™ in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®; manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.), and more recently, Incyte’s retifanlimab (developed by Incyte Corporation), in advanced breast cancer. Thirty patients were treated with the Bria-IMT™ regimen (19 with the Bria-IMT™ regimen alone, four who began on the Bria-IMT™ regimen and transitioned to a combination of Bria-IMT™ with Incyte’s retifanlimab, and seven with a combination of Bria-IMT™ with KEYTRUDA®). Eleven of those patients had moderately-well differentiated tumors. Seventy percent of these patients who were able to develop an immune response showed disease control, suggesting that Bria-IMT™, with a molecular signature most closely related to moderately-well differentiated tumors, may result in disease control, especially in patients with moderately-well differentiated tumors. These patients were very heavily pre-treated with a median of seven prior systemic therapy regimens (including chemotherapy, biological and “targeted” therapy). The median PFS of this cohort was 5.7 months in the monotherapy study, and 6.9 months in combination therapy. Of the group, there were nine patients with evaluable lesions including six with stable disease and two with partial responses according to RECIST criteria. One patient with stable disease had a marked reduction in numerous non-target lesions. The data suggests clinical and survival benefits for patients with moderately-well differentiated tumors who were treated with the Bria-IMT™ regimen with or without check point inhibitors. Notably, the survival benefit was higher in the group that received the Bria-IMT™ regimen with check point inhibitors, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect.
 
The median OS for the combined monotherapy and combination therapy was 12.5 months (data on six patients with moderately-well differentiated tumors). An OS of 7.2-9.8 months in similar patients with metastatic breast cancer in the third line setting has recently been published (Kazmi S, et al. “Overall survival analysis in patients with metastatic breast cancer and liver or lung metastases treated with eribulin, gemcitabine, or capecitabine.” Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2020). This suggests a potentially significant survival benefit for the patients treated with the Bria-IMT™ regimen alone or in combination with check point inhibitors.
 
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
The product will initially be marketed to oncologists who are well-versed in the use of immunotherapy for cancer. Partnering with other pharmaceutical companies in order to market combinations with a number of drugs is also an option that we intend to pursue. This study will utilize a frozen formulation which consists of irradiated SV-BR-1-GM cells in viable freezing media. This formulation will permit stockpiling of the immunotherapy so that it can be sent on demand to clinical sites. The eventual goal is to reach all oncologists who treat late stage breast cancer, either by direct outreach or by partnering with another company that has an established presence in the oncology space.
Other Commercial Considerations
 
There is a high unmet medical need in late-stage breast cancer, providing potential for accelerated approval of Bria-IMT™. The FDA is interested in facilitating the availability of novel therapies of patients with unmet medical needs, especially those that can target the population most likely to respond. In addition, the FDA has granted “Fast Track” status to BriaCell’s lead candidate, Bria-IMT™, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. These two facts may help facilitate the accelerated approval of Bria-IMT™.
Production and Marketing Plan
 
Bria-IMT™ cells grow in simple tissue culture media and are irradiated prior to inoculation. Bria-IMT™ manufacturing will be performed by Contract Manufacturing Organizations. We have been working with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (“KBI”) and the University of California, Davis Health System (“UC Davis”) GMP facility, who have developed a frozen formulation where the cells are grown, harvested and irradiated, followed by cryopreservation in a viable state. The cells are stockpiled and shipped directly to clinical sites for inoculation. Each lot of Bria-IMT™ is tested for potency (i.e. GM-CSF production), identity (i.e. HER2+ and ER/PR-) and adventitious agents to rule out contamination with infectious agents. To date, there have been no issues with these tests. Additional manufacturing facilities have been evaluated and may be enlisted as demand grows.

Marketing will target oncologists who are well-versed in the use of immunotherapy and especially breast cancer treatment centers. The initial target will be patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer who have failed at least two prior treatment regimens. We plan to develop the clinical data for Bria-IMT™ and to use this information to reach out to oncologists seeking additional therapeutic options for their patients. We will include in this effort a physician education campaign targeting the oncologists most likely to treat metastatic breast cancer. As these physicians become more aware of the data regarding Bria-IMT™ in breast cancer, we will make sure they also understand how best to use Bria-IMT™ in combination with other therapies that have complementary synergistic mechanisms of action. This will also come from the clinical studies described above focusing on combination therapy. Partnering with other pharmaceutical companies in order to market a number of drugs is also an option that we intend to pursue. Our eventual goal is to reach all oncologists who treat late stage breast cancer, either by direct outreach or by partnering with another company that has an established presence in the oncology space.
 
License Agreements
 
On July 24, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary, BriaCell Therapeutics Corp., Sapientia, and all the shareholders of Sapientia.

The Company has filed and own or have licensed all rights in the following pending patent applications and issued patents:
 
Filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) on June 14, 2004, U.S. Patent No. 7,674,456 B2, includes claims to the following:
 

1. | Compositions comprising SV-BR cells 
---+---------------------------------------------------
2. | Therapeutic methods of using said compositions 

 
On February 27, 2017, BriaCell filed an international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) to further expand its intellectual property portfolio underlying the Company’s current and anticipated pipeline of whole-cell cancer immunotherapeutics, including Bria-IMT™ and Bria-OTS™. The PCT application (PCT/US2017/019757) claims priority to two provisional patent applications filed by the Company with the USPTO in 2016. In essence, it provides the framework for additional whole-cell cancer immunotherapeutics beyond Bria-IMT™ and strategies for patient-specific selection of the most likely effective whole-cell immunotherapeutic (BriaDx™). The PCT application entered the National Phase in the second half of 2018.
 
On July 24, 2017, BriaCell obtained the exclusive license to certain patents related to PKCδ inhibitor technology, including patents to specific compounds, methods of using the compounds, and methods of assessing patients regarding the compounds. These patents include U.S. Patent No. 9,364,460, which was issued on June 14, 2016; U.S. Patent No. 9,572,793, which issued on February 21, 2017; U.S. Patent No. 9,844,534, which was issued December 19, 2017; and EP Patent No. 2897610, which was issued on January 10, 2018.
 
To the knowledge of the Company’s management, there are no contested proceedings or third-party claims over any of our patent applications. Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies through intellectual property agreements including patents, trademarks, know-how, and confidentiality agreements. However, there can be no assurance that the above-mentioned patent applications will be approved by the appropriate agencies.
 
All of the technology for which patents are currently sought is owned by the Company. Our patents are entirely owned or exclusively licensed by the Company.
 
Competition
 
Cancer immunotherapy has become a significant growth area for the biopharmaceutical industry, attracting large pharmaceutical companies as well as small niche players. Generally, our principal competitors in the cancer immunotherapy market comprise both companies with currently approved products for various indications, such as manufacturers of approved bispecific antibodies, CAR-T cells, and checkpoint inhibitors, as well as companies currently engaged in cancer immunotherapy clinical development. The large and medium-size players who have successfully obtained approval for cancer immunotherapy products include Bristol-Myers Squib Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Genentech, Inc. (a subsidiary of Roche Holding AG), AstraZeneca PLC, Celgene Corporation, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, Novartis, Acerta Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of AstraZeneca), Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Celgene), Kite Pharma, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc./EMD Serono, Inc. Most of these companies, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources than does BriaCell.
 
Companies developing novel products with similar indications to those we are pursuing are expected to influence our ability to penetrate and maintain market share. For patients with early stage breast cancer, adjuvant therapy is often given to prevent recurrence and increase the chance of long-term disease-free survival. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, or combinations thereof. In addition, the HER2 targeted drug trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN), alone or in combination with pertuzumab (PERJETA), both manufactured and marketed by Roche/Genentech, may be given to patients with tumors with high expression of HER2 (IHC 3+), as well as other novel targets such as MUC1, which may be useful in treating breast cancer. In addition, the FDA approved the first ever immunotherapy regimen for breast cancer to the Roche/Genentech PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ), combined with Celgene’s nab-paclitaxel (ABRAXANE) for TNBC that cannot be removed with surgery and is locally advanced or metastatic.

There are a number of cancer vaccines in development for breast cancer, including but not limited to TPIV200 (Marker Therapeutics, Inc.), AE-37 (Antigen Express), and Stimuvax (Merck KgA). While these development candidates are aimed at a number of different targets, and AE-37 has published data in the HER2 breast cancer patient population, there is no guarantee that any of these compounds will not in the future be indicated for treatment of low-to-intermediate HER2 breast cancer patients and become directly competitive with NPS.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and also have greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for cancer immunotherapy products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize, thus causing limited market share before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing of our cancer immunotherapy product candidate.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development of cancer immunotherapy product candidates.
 
These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, the ability to work with specific clinical contract organizations due to conflicts of interest, and the conduct of trials in the ability to recruit clinical trial sites and subjects for our clinical trials.
 
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our current product candidates or any other future product candidate, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished product candidate for our clinical trials. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.
 
Bria-IMT™ is currently manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) pursuant to agreements with UC Davis and with KBI, which is located in The Woodlands, Texas.
 
On June 11, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement for Services with The Regents of the University of California, acting for and on behalf of UC Davis, pursuant to which UC Davis manufactures Bria-IMT™ (previously known as BriaVax) at its GMP facility. The Company pays UC Davis certain hourly rates depending on the specific services provided by UC Davis in connection with its manufacturing of Bria-IMT™.
 
Pursuant to the Company’s master services agreement with KBI, dated March 17, 2017, KBI has conducted developmental studies to derive and optimize a cryopreserved formulation of Bria-IMT™ (previously known as BriaVax) as a research working cell bank of final drug product doses suitable for cold chain shipment (the “KBI Services”). The Company pays for the cost of materials, consumables, and third party services, plus an additional 5% fee to compensate KBI for the cost of purchasing, material handling, inventory and administration and management of third party services necessary for KBI to perform the KBI Services. The master services agreement with KBI terminates on May 4, 2027.
 
On July 5, 2022, BriaCell announced that it had entered into a manufacturing service agreement with Waisman Biomanufacturing at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (“Waisman”), to manufacture Bria-Pros™, BriaCell’s off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy for prostate cancer, for anticipated use in clinical studies. Waisman is a leading contract manufacturing organization with experience in the manufacturing of cellular therapies for clinical trials. Under the terms of the agreement, Waisman will be responsible for GMP manufacturing of Bria-Pros™ for anticipated use in clinical studies. Waisman’s expert team will be working closely with BriaCell’s scientific and product development teams to ensure timely production of Bria-Pros™ in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the FDA.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our future commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for the use of our product candidates for one or more indications.
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
The Company does not own any real property. BriaCell’s corporate offices in Canada are located at Suite 300, Bellevue Centre, 235-15th Street, West Vancouver, BC V7T 2XI, and its corporate and research offices in the United States are located at 2929 Arch Street 3rd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104.
 
We consider our current office space sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for the foreseeable future and suitable for the conduct of our business.
 
Government Regulation
 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. Along with third-party contractors, we will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our current or future product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.

29
--


The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is begun; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”); and 
● | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually when significant changes are made. 

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our current or future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 

30
--


Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by a Data & Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) organized by the clinical trial sponsor, which provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial, and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects, or based on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical trial results to public registries.
 
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 

● | Phase 1-The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2-The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. In some cases, FDA will grant preliminary marketing authorization for drugs treating areas of high unmet medical need based on Phase 2 clinical trials. If granted, they will also require confirmatory Phase 3 evaluation post-marketing. BriaCell is evaluating Bria-IMT in patients with breast cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. In this population there is no approved therapy. Therefore, the development plan for Bria-IMT is an area of high unmet medical need. It is anticipated that BriaCell will not need to complete Phase 3 clinical trials prior to submitting the marketing application for Bria-IMT in patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. In this case, a confirmatory Phase 3 evaluation post-marketing will be required. It is anticipated that this would consist of a randomized, controlled clinical trial of Bria-IMT in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with best available therapy. However, this design is subject to negotiation with the FDA. 


● | Phase 3-The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 4-In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 

 
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.


The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a product candidate with Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A Fast Track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
Under the Accelerated Approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 
In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy, if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.
 
Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act (“FCA”), the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors.
 

33
--


The FCA imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. For example, the federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multibillion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increases the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gives state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. Seeking coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors can be time consuming and expensive. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have processes that require the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed in that country.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union (the “E.U.”) member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of a new drug or medicinal product in the E.U., a sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing authorization application. The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the E.U. depends on the nature of the medicinal product.
 
The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the E.U., as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated as “orphan drugs” and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which was not authorized in the European Community; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at the European Community level.
 
Under the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”)), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: (i) the seriousness of the disease to be treated, (ii) the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and (iii) anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.


The Mutual Recognition Procedure (“MRP”) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the E.U. The MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more member states.
 

35
--


The characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already existing marketing authorization in a member state of the E.U. that is used as reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other E.U. member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the E.U. and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other E.U. member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states.
 
The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by E.U. member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.
 
Should any E.U. member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.
 
For other countries outside of the E.U., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Under an FDA approved protocol, another arm has recently been added to the Phase II study to evaluate the effects of dosing schedules for patients in the study.
 
The Phase I portion of the trial, with the primary goal of assessing safety and tolerability of the combination, enrolled 12 subjects who had previously failed at least two prior lines of therapy, characterized as a difficult-to-treat patient population. The combination treatment had a favorable safety profile and appeared well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities.
 
Progressing through the Phase II part of the clinical trial, a randomized controlled design will be used to allow comparison of the effectiveness of the treatment regimens between the two arms of the study with different dosing schedules.
 
BriaCell noted it is on schedule to meet with the FDA later this year to discuss the design of a key registration study.
