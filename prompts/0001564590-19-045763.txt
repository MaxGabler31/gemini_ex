Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 We are a Delaware corporation and were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. As noted in the Introductory Note above, we consummated the Business Combination with Kalerya S.p.A. on November 25, 2019.
 Business Strategy
 Our business strategy was to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from our management team’s operational expertise. Our selection process leveraged our management team’s broad and deep relationship network and unique Technology, Media and Telecommunications (“TMT”) industry expertise including proven deal-sourcing and structuring capabilities, to provide us with a multitude of business combination opportunities. Our management team has experience:

Competition
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we encountered intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possessed greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources were relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.
Employees
 We had two executive officers. These individuals were not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intended to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they devoted in any time period varied based on whether a target business had been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the Company was in.
