ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Background
 
We are a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of a platform utilizing proprietary vaporization technology to commercialize health, wellness and beauty treatments, or the Platform.
 
Our product offerings include Novokid, an innovative home use device for the elimination of lice and eggs while employing a natural, plant based compound, pesticides and silicone free and Shine, a revolutionary home use device for hair and scalp cleansing and rejuvenation.
 
As of the date hereof, we have limited operations and no revenues from our business operations. There is substantial doubt that we can continue as a going concern and an on-going business for the next twelve months without the success of our business operations which foresees the generation of the revenues during 2018.
 
We project that we will need to raise up to $1,000,000 during the next 12 months in order to successfully implement our business plan and to become profitable, of which there can be no assurance. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms, if at all, when needed, may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our products development efforts and secure regulatory approvals and would adversely impact our planned research and development efforts in connection with the Company’s future products, which may make it more difficult for us to attain profitability.
 
On February 8, 2016, we signed a Merger Agreement, or the Merger Agreement, with Novomic Ltd., or Novomic, a private company organized under the laws of the State of Israel and a Shareholders’ Agreement with the Novomic’s shareholders, or the Shareholders’ Agreement. The Merger Agreement was by and between the Company, on the one hand, and Novomic together with YMY Industry Ltd., or YMY, and Microdel Ltd. or Microdel, the latter two of which are hereinafter referred to as the “Novomic Founders,” on the other hand. On August 9, 2016, we consummated the merger under the Merger Agreement and Novomic became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Upon closing of the merger, the former Novomic shareholders owned approximately 73.52% of our capital stock and TechCare stockholders retained approximately 26.48% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, while TechCare was the legal acquirer, Novomic was treated as the acquiring company in the merger for accounting purposes, and the merger was accounted for as a reverse merger as described in note 3 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are included within Item 8 in this annual report.
 
As a result, the financial statements of the Company prior to the merger date are the historical financial statements of Novomic, whereas the financial statements of the Company after the merger date reflect the results of the operations of Novomic and Techcare on a combined basis.
 
In connection with the closing of the Merger Agreement, the Company (i) changed its name from BreedIT Corp. to TechCare Corp.; (ii) the 149,219,173 outstanding shares of the Registrant’s common Stock were subject to a reverse split on a one-for-thirty (1:30) basis, resulting in 4,973,972 outstanding shares of common stock; and (iii) authorized ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001, which may be issued in one or more classes or series, having such designations, preferences, privileges and rights as our board of directors may determine.
 
Novomic was incorporated as a private limited liability Company in Israel in 2009. Since inception, Novomic has been a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of the Platform utilizing its proprietary device that vaporizes liquids from a contained capsule into a treatment area.
 
Our Treatment Solutions
 
Novokid – Natural, Plant-based and Effective Lice Treatment
 
Parents and children exposed to head lice are now forced to use standard over-the-counter, or OTC, treatments that are toxic, often ineffective, time consuming and expensive. According to the Journal of Medical Entomology, 98% of lice have developed resistance to existing treatments in the US and they have now referred to as “super-lice”. Most current treatments contain pesticides, alcohol or silicone, which are all associated with a wide variety of hazardous side effects.
 
Novokid is a non-pesticide, natural, plant-based and eco-friendly solution that eliminates lice and super lice by a 10 minute dry treatment. This compares with current treatments that required 20-40 minutes of shampooing and daily combing. Our treatment is fast, dry, clean, and easily administered at home or on the go. Novokid can also be used as a maintenance and preventative treatment if used regularly.

Shine – Natural Haircare rejuvenation
 
Shine uses cold vaporization and a proprietary formulation to clean, treat and improve the appearance of the hair and scalp. In addition to removing the residue of products, the treatments will balance the hair’s pH levels, add body and shine, define curls, and strengthen and protect hair from further damage. Like our solution for lice, users simply put a Shine capsule in the compressor, place the attached cap on their head and sit for a 10-minute treatment. There is no need to rinse or shampoo following the treatment.
 
The global hair care market is estimated to be in excess of $80 billion per annum and we are looking to establish a presence in the home treatment niche. To that end, we are in the process of expanding the Shine treatment product line to include formulations for the needs of specific hair types, such as dry, curly, colored, and over-processed hair.
 
Recent Developments and Plans
 
Our current and future products are all based on the Platform which was developed over a period of seven years. During the past 18 months, we have achieved the following:

● | Performed extensive market research for the lice treatment/prevention market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completed product development of Novokid, which included finalization of commercial design of vaporizer, capsules and head cap, optimizing the product efficiency, negotiating and finalizing the product supply chain across various suppliers; 
● | Received the Israeli Ministry of health approval, or AMAR, to market our Novokid head lice treatment products in Israel; 
● | Attained ISO 9001certification; 
● | Obtained CE approval for Novokid, classified as a Class I medical device; 
● | Obtained recommendations from leading senior pediatrics; 
● | Opened Company headquarters offices in Israel’s Rosh Ha’ayin Industrial Park; 
● | Entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer, or OEM, Agreement, which we refer to as the OEM Agreement, according to which the OEM distributor will manufacture, distribute and sell the Company’s Novokid head lice treatment products, in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica and Colombia, all on an exclusive basis; 
● | entered into a distribution agreement with an exclusive distributor of our Novokid product line in the Netherlands; and 
● | Contracted and setup production facilities in China and Israel. 

 
During the next 12-18 months, we plan to focus our efforts on the following:
 

● | Finalizing additional distribution, OEM and JV agreements with well-known distributes and manufacturers, in Israel and throughout the world; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reduction of manufacturing costs; 
● | Finalizing the development and commercialization of Shine, the Company’s hair treatment devices exploiting our proprietary vapor based delivery platform; 
● | Obtain the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for Novokid, by and through our OEM distributor; 
● | Obtain CE and FDA approvals for Shine; 
● | Complete preparations for mass production by launching an automated capsule production line; 
● | Presenting the platform and its application in leading conferences around the globe; and 
● | Developing our dermatology and pests control applications, based on our Platform. 

 
We may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals for our head lice treatment platform and any future products. If unable to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, our business will be adversely affected. CE approval, already obtained, is required for the marketing, distributing and sale of our products in the European Union, whereas FDA approval is required for such marketing, distributing and sale in the United States. In the event that our products are to be sold in certain territories requiring additional regulatory approvals, such approvals will need to be obtained by us or by our distributors.

Sales and Marketing
 
While the vaporizer for both Novokid and Shine is designated to be a one-time purchase, the head cap and capsules, will be sold separately based on the razor/razor-blade business model. Based on our estimates, which we believe are both reasonable and conservative, our target customers are expected to purchase between 12-16 capsule units per year. Therefore, we estimate that the majority of our revenues will be generated in the future based on capsules sales for both Novokid and Shine products.
 
The Company plans to focus its initial sales and marketing efforts on the European Union, where CE approval was obtained in Q3 2017, and once FDA approval for the Novokid product is received also the United States.
 
In order to achieve our intended global footprint and market presence, we plan to base our primary distribution method on the distribution model, in which the distributor will sell our products under our name and branding. In specific instances, we will consider implementing the OEM model, in which the distributor will sell our products under a co-branding arrangement. We believe that these models will reduce our marketing costs while starting to generate revenues to support our research and development efforts for utilizing our technological platform to expand our product line.
 
The Company also plans to market and advertise its products through implementing an omni-channel strategy, both through online and retail sales outlets, which we believe will present a huge opportunity for generating sales and market acceptance.
 
Production
 
We manufacture our products through third party manufacturers in Israel and China. The Novokid vaporizer is manufactured in China by a local manufacturer which also handles assembly, integration and quality assurance for the vaporizer and manufactures the cap and the ancillary components of the Novokid Kit. The Novokid treatment capsules are manufactured and filled in Israel by third party contractors.
Research and Development
 
We incurred approximately $1.3 million on research and development during the past two years. During this period, the Company completed the development of both the Novokid and Shine products, which included finalization of commercial design of the compressor, capsules and head cap and optimizing the products efficiency.
 
We plan to build upon the research and development achievements we had with the completion of the Novokid product for head lice treatment as the basis to expand our variety of treatments and solutions, which will also be based on the developed Platform and the knowledge we gained during the past two years.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Due to the importance of patents, we have has devoted significant efforts and resources and will continue to invest resources in strengthening our patent portfolio. Below is the list of patents we have registered to date:

Patents | Each patent’s relevance to the program | Date and status of registration 
--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------

Competition
 
Novokid
 
In the key markets, in which we plan to compete, our competition will range from prescription and OTC treatments, many of which are well-established and accepted in the market, to simple home remedies, which include occlusive agents, such as “petrolatum shampoo,” mayonnaise, butter or margarine, herbal oils, and olive oil, applied to suffocate the lice. These home remedies, while widely used, have not been evaluated for effectiveness in randomized controlled trials. To date, only anecdotal information is available concerning effectiveness.
 
At present, there are four to five products and many low-cost generics and store brand equivalents that dominate the lice treatment market. However, the active ingredients in these pharmacological therapies are mostly based on chemical insecticides. A major problem that chemical-based solution are now facing (mainly pyrethroids) is that a growing amount of head lice have developed gene mutation that made them resisted to pyrethroids (those lice are being referred in the common population as “Super Lice”). Pyrethroids are the family of insecticides used to kill lice in common over-the-counter treatment products.
 
During our research we found that no product on the market today provides a complete solution comparable to our treatment, which we believe will place us in position to succeed in the head lice treatment market. Our treatment is designed to create an isolate, controlled environment around the head lice-infested area, in-which a vapor concentration of acetic acid is created, which will be fatal for lice and their eggs, but harmless to the skin and hair of the patient.
 
Shine
 
In the key markets, in which we plan to compete, our competition will range from other beauty and hair care related devices and other dry cosmetic products. Our market research has indicated that we present a unique and innovative alternative to such treatments presenting an efficient, easy to use, cost effective treatment.
Seasonality
 
It is unlikely that all head lice infestations can be prevented, because children come into head-to-head contact with each other frequently, most often in school or in other environments where children are together. As a result, head-lice incidence peaks during the school year and during the summer camps. Therefore, we expect strong demand for our product throughout the year with minor or no seasonality fluctuations.
Social and Economic Factors
 
Schools in the United States, Canada, and Australia commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed. This could have major social implications on both the children and the parents that are required on a day’s notice to cease their day-to-day activities and focus on their child’s head lice problem. To save time and for better results, we believe that people will readily accept and use the latest technology and cost efficient product represented by our treatment.
 
Israel, our home base country, had a corporate tax rate of 24% in 2017 and has signed tax treaties with many countries to reduce export and import tariffs. We believe that this export friendly policy of Israel will help our business because we will be manufacturing the capsules, which are the main component of the products in Israel, for export to the United States, Canada and countries of European Union with the collective market we estimate to have hundreds of millions of persons, mostly children, infected with head lice on an annual basis.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our head lice treatment is subject to regulation by and approval from CE and the FDA. European Union regulations specify that treatments for human diseases be classified either as a medicinal product or a medical device. Pediculosis (head lice) treatments fall into both categories. The European Union defines three different classes of pediculosis treatments:
 
1. Those that act via pharmacologically active ingredients (such as insecticides like pyrethrum extract, organophosphates or carbamates). These are classified as medicinal products. Such treatments have to overcome possibilities of resistance and toxicity (for example, the phasing out of lindane in Europe over toxological and environmental concerns).
 
2. A more recent class of treatments are those that act via a physical mechanism, as opposed to a chemical one. These are classified as medical devices and include silicone oil-based treatments such as dimeticones. By contrast to the former class of treatments, these are non-toxic to humans and are not likely to suffer from problems of resistance.
 
3. The third class of treatments are those which are based on essential oils and herbal extracts. Efficacy claims for such treatments have been advanced under both chemical and physical headings: they are mostly registered as medical devices.

During Q3 2017, we have obtained a CE approval for our Novokid solution, classified as a Class I medical device.
 
FDA approved treatments for head lice include both OTC products and prescription drugs, such as Nix and Rid, in the form of shampoos, creams and lotions. However, many head lice products are not for use in children under the age of two. Although OTC drugs are available for treatment of head lice, health care professionals often prescribe drugs recently approved by the FDA, such as Ulesfia (approved in 2009), Natroba (approved in 2011) or Sklice (approved in 2012) for the treatment of head lice.
 
With respect to obtaining an FDA approval, we have entered into an OEM Agreement, according to which the OEM distributor will manufacture, distribute and sell the Company’s Novokid head lice treatment products, in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica and Colombia, all on an exclusive basis. Under such OEM Agreement the OEM distributer will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the FDA approval and shall bear all costs related to such approval. We expect that the FDA approval process should take approximately 12 months.
 
Employees
 
We currently engage 11 employees and service providers working in various fields of management, research and development, product management, marketing and regulatory advice.
 
We are subject to Israeli labor laws and regulations with respect to our employees located in Israel. These laws and regulations principally concern matters such as pensions, paid annual vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday and work week, minimum wages, overtime pay, insurance for work-related accidents, severance pay and other conditions of employment. Our employees are not represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages.
