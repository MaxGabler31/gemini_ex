General 
 CenterState Bank Corporation (“We,” “Our,”  “CenterState,” “CSFL,” or the “Company”) is a financial holding company incorporated in September 20, 1999 under the laws of the State of Florida. Through our national bank subsidiary, CenterState Bank, N.A. (“CenterState Bank” or the “Bank”), we provide a full range of consumer and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses and industries through our headquarters branch in Winter Haven, Florida and, as of December 31, 2018, a 126 bank branch network located throughout Florida, Georgia and Alabama, as well as one loan production office in Florida and one loan production office in Macon, Georgia.  CenterState is among the largest Florida-based community banking organizations in terms of publicly available deposit data as of December 31, 2018.   
 We also operate, through our Bank, a correspondent banking and capital markets service division for over 600 small and medium sized community banks throughout the United States. Based primarily in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama, this division earns commissions on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. 
 We have grown primarily through a series of acquisitions, starting in June 2000 through 2018. Our most recent acquisitions include: 
 
 
• | Gulfstream Bancshares, Inc. (“Gulfstream”), in January 2014, which added approximately $479 million in deposits; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | First Southern Bancorp, Inc. (“First Southern”), in June 2014, which added approximately $853 million in deposits; 
• | Community Bank of South Florida, Inc. (“Community”), in March 2016, which added approximately $453 million in deposits;


• | Hometown of Homestead Banking Company (“Hometown”), in March 2016, which added approximately $253 million in deposits; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Platinum Bank Holding Company (“Platinum”), in April 2017, which added approximately $520 million in deposits; 
• | Gateway Financial Holdings of Florida, Inc. (“Gateway”) in May 2017, which added approximately $708 million in deposits;
• | HCBF Holding Company, Inc. (“HCBF”), in January 2018, which added approximately $719 million in deposits; 


• | Sunshine Bancorp, Inc. (“Sunshine”), also in January 2018, which added approximately $1.8 billion in deposits; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Charter Financial Corporation (“Charter”), in September 2018, which added approximately $1.3 billion in deposits. 

 On November 23, 2018, CenterState entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with National Commerce Corporation (“NCC”), a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, which engages in the business of banking through National Bank of Commerce (“NBC”). NBC operates branches throughout Florida (including under the trade names United Legacy Bank, Reunion Bank of Florida, Patriot Bank, Premier Bank and FirstAtlantic Bank), in the Atlanta, Georgia area (including under the trade names First Landmark Bank, Private Bank of Buckhead, Private Bank of Decatur and PrivatePlus Mortgage) and in Birmingham, Huntsville, Auburn-Opelika and Baldwin County, Alabama.  NCC also engages in the business of factoring commercial receivables of transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers through the United States and parts of Canada through a subsidiary, CBI Holding Company, LLC, and its subsidiary Corporate Billing, LLC. Upon completion of the merger, which is subject to receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions, CenterState will have on a pro forma basis, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, assets of $16.4 billion, deposits of $12.8 billion, loans of $11.5 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $2.9 billion. 
 We also own R4ALL, Inc. (“R4ALL”), which acquires and disposes troubled assets, and CSFL Insurance Corp. (“CSFL IC”), which operates a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code.  
 At December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated assets of $12.3 billion, total consolidated loans of $8.3 billion, total consolidated deposits of $9.5 billion, and total consolidated shareholders’ equity of $2.0 billion. 
 Our revenue is primarily derived from interest on, and fees received in connection with, real estate and other loans, interest and dividends from investment securities and short-term investments, and commissions on bond sales.  The principal sources of funds for our lending activities are customer deposits, repayment of loans, and the sale and maturity of investment securities.  Our principal expenses are interest paid on deposits, and operating and general administrative expenses. 
 As is the case with banking institutions generally, our operations are materially and significantly influenced by the real estate market, general economic conditions, and by the tax, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and state government and regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).  Deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest.  Lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds, including tax rates and regulatory structure.  We face strong competition in the attraction of deposits (our primary source of lendable funds) and in the origination of loans.  See “Competition.” 
 Lending Activities 
 We offer a range of lending services, including real estate, consumer and commercial loans, to individuals and small businesses and other organizations that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market area.  Our consolidated loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $8.3 billion, or 68% and $4.8 billion, or 67%, respectively, of total consolidated assets.  The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, and amount of the loan, and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations.  We have no foreign loans or loans for highly leveraged transactions.  We do have immaterial amounts of loans with foreigners on property located within our Florida market area, primarily vacation and second homes. 
 Our loans are concentrated in three major areas: real estate loans, commercial loans and consumer loans.  A majority of our loans are made on a secured basis.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately 84% of our consolidated loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by mortgages on real estate, 14% of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans (not secured by real estate) and 2% of our loan portfolio consisted of consumer and other loans. 
 Our real estate loans are secured by mortgages and consist primarily of loans to individuals and businesses for the purchase, improvement of or investment in real estate, for the construction of single-family residential and commercial units, and for the development of single-family residential building lots. These real estate loans may be made at fixed or variable interest rates.  Generally, we do not make fixed-rate commercial real estate loans for terms exceeding five years.  Loans in excess of five years are generally made at adjustable interest rates.  Our residential real estate loans generally are repayable in monthly installments based on up to a 15-year or a 30-year amortization schedule with variable or fixed interest rates. 
 Our commercial loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to small-to-medium sized businesses located primarily in our market area for working capital, equipment purchases, and various other business purposes.  A majority of commercial loans are secured by equipment or similar assets, but these loans may also be made on an unsecured basis.  Commercial loans may be made at variable or fixed rates of interest.  Commercial lines of credit are typically granted on a one-year basis, with loan covenants and monetary thresholds.  Other commercial loans with terms or amortization schedules of longer than one year will normally carry interest rates which vary with the prime lending rate and will become payable in full and are generally refinanced in three to five 
 2
 

years.  Commercial and agricultural loans not secured by real estate amounted to approximately 14% and 15% of our Company’s total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Our consumer loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to individuals for various consumer purposes, but includes some business purpose loans which are payable on an installment basis.  The majority of these loans are for terms of less than five years and are secured by liens on various personal assets of the borrowers, but consumer loans may also be made on an unsecured basis.  Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates, and are often based on up to a five-year amortization schedule. 
 At December 31, 2018, approximately 44% of our total non-PCI (“Purchased Credit-Impaired”) loan portfolio is fixed rate, 14% is floating rate and 42% is variable rate other than floating.
 Loan originations are derived primarily from employee loan officers within our local market areas, but can also be attributed to referrals from existing customers and borrowers, advertising, or walk-in customers. 
 Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans.  These include prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers.  In particular, longer maturities increase the risk that economic conditions will change and adversely affect collectability.  We attempt to minimize credit losses through various means.  In particular, on larger credits, we generally rely on the cash flow of a debtor as the source of repayment and secondarily on the value of the underlying collateral.  In addition, we attempt to employ shorter loan terms in order to reduce the risk of a decline in the value of such collateral. 
 In addition, we have a mortgage line of business which originates single-family home loans and sells a majority of those mortgages into the secondary market of which the majority are sold with servicing rights released. We also have a SBA 7(a) line of business whereby we routinely sell the government guaranteed portion of the SBA loans to investors with the unguaranteed portion of the loan and the servicing rights retained.
 For additional information regarding our loan portfolio, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Deposit Activities 
 Deposits are the major source of our funds for lending and other investment activities.  We consider the majority of our regular savings, demand, negotiable order of withdrawal or NOW, and money market deposit accounts to be core deposits.  These accounts comprised approximately 81% and 85% of our consolidated total deposits at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Approximately 19% and 15% of our consolidated deposits at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were certificates of deposit.  Generally, we attempt to maintain the rates paid on our deposits at a competitive level.  Time deposits of $100,000 and over made up approximately 10% and 8% of consolidated total deposits at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The majority of the deposits are generated from market areas where we conduct business.  Generally, we do not solicit deposits on a national level.  We obtain substantially all of our deposits from customers in our local markets.  For additional information regarding the Company’s deposit accounts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Deposits.” 
Investments 
 Our available for sale investment debt securities portfolio was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing 14% and 15% of our total consolidated assets.  At December 31, 2018, approximately 92% of this portfolio was invested in U.S. government mortgage backed securities (“MBS”), specifically residential Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae MBS.  We have selected these types of investments because such securities generally represent what we believe to be a minimal investment risk.  We do not own any private label MBSs.  Approximately 5%, or $88.8 million, of this portfolio is invested in municipal securities.  Our investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth, and are generally used to provide for the investment of excess funds at acceptable risks levels while providing liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits.  Investment debt securities available for sale are recorded on our balance sheet at market value at each balance sheet date.  Any change in market value is recorded directly in our shareholders’ equity account and is not recognized in our income statement unless the security is sold or unless it is impaired and the impairment is other than temporary.  During 2018, we sold approximately $23.1 million of these securities and recognized a net loss on the sales of approximately $22,000.  In addition, we sold approximately $332.6 million of securities acquired from the purchase of Harbor and Sunshine on January 1, 2018.  These securities were marked to fair value and subsequently sold soon after the acquisition date and thus no gains or losses were recognized.   
 Occasionally, we may purchase certificates of deposits of national and state banks.  These investments may exceed $250,000 in any one institution (the limit of FDIC insurance for deposit accounts).  Federal funds sold, money market accounts and interest bearing deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank represent the excess cash we have available over and above daily cash needs.  Federal funds sold and money market funds are invested on an overnight basis with approved correspondent banks. 
 3
 

We monitor changes in financial markets.  In addition to investments for our portfolio, we monitor daily cash positions to ensure that all available funds earn interest at the earliest possible date.  A portion of the investment account is invested in liquid securities that can be readily converted to cash with minimum risk of market loss.  These investments usually consist of obligations of U.S. government agencies, mortgage backed securities and federal funds.  The remainder of the investment account may be placed in investment securities of different type and/or longer maturity.  Daily surplus funds are sold in the federal funds market for one business day.  We attempt to stagger the maturities of our securities so as to produce a steady cash-flow in the event cash is needed, or economic conditions change. 
 We also have a trading securities portfolio managed at our Bank.  For this portfolio, realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Non-interest Income in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal securities and are held for short periods of time.  During 2018, we purchased approximately $254.6 million of securities for this portfolio and sold $259.7 million, recognizing a net realized gain on sale of approximately $20,000.  At December 31, 2018 we had $1.7 million of securities in our trading portfolio. 
 Our held to maturity debt securities portfolio was $216.8 million and $232.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, representing 2% and 3% our total consolidated assets.  These securities had unrecognized net losses of approximately $4.7 million and $784,000, resulting in estimated fair values of $212.2 million and $231.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  At December 31, 2018, approximately 39% of this portfolio is invested in MBS and 61% in municipal securities.  It is anticipated that this portfolio will generally hold longer term securities for the primary purpose of yield.  This classification was chosen to minimize temporary effects on our tangible equity and tangible equity ratio due to increases and decreases in general market interest rates. 
 Correspondent Banking 
 Our correspondent banking and capital markets segment operates as a division within our Bank.  Its primary revenue generating activities are related to the capital markets division which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities.  Income generated related to the correspondent banking services includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and fees generated from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related services.  The fees derived from the correspondent banking services are less volatile than those generated through the capital markets group. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions located throughout the United States. 
Acquisition Strategy
 Our business growth, profitability and market share have been enhanced by us engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions either within or contiguous to our existing footprint.  Our acquisition strategy focuses on banking institutions that: 

• | are a good fit with our culture; 
• | are strategically attractive by enhancing our footprint, allowing for cost savings and economies of scale, or providing market diversification, or otherwise may be strategically compelling;
• | have been determined to meet our risk appetite and profile; and 
• | meet our financial criteria. 

 We expect to continue to assess future opportunities of financial companies using these criteria, based on market and other conditions.  
 Data Processing 
 We use a single in-house core data processing solution.  The core data processing system provides deposit processing, loan processing and overall accounting services.  
 The Bank provides item processing services and certain other information technology (“IT”) services for itself and the Company overall.  These services include: sorting, encoding, processing, and imaging checks and rendering checking and other deposit statements to commercial and retail customers, as well as providing IT services, including intranet and internet services for our Bank and the Company overall. 
Effect of Governmental Policies 
 Our earnings and business are and will be affected by the policies of various regulatory authorities of the United States, especially the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve, among other things, seeks to influence interest rates and the supply of money 
 4
 

and credit within the United States.  Among the traditional methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings, expanded access to funds for non-banks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. The Federal Reserve has, as a response to the financial crisis, steeply increased the size of its balance sheet by buying securities and has paid interest on excess reserves held by banks at the Federal Reserve.  Both the traditional and more recent methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, interest rates on loans and securities, and rates paid for deposits.  The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future.  The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment, and short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government.  Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the Federal Reserve has begun to increase this benchmark rate. In addition, after an extended period during which the Federal Reserve increased the size of its balance sheet substantially above historical levels through the purchase of debt securities, the Federal Reserve has begun to reduce the size of its balance sheet from these elevated levels, which might also affect interest rates.  Future monetary policies, including whether the Federal Reserve will continue to increase the federal funds rate and whether or at what pace it will continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet, and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the Company and our subsidiary bank cannot be predicted.
 Supervision and Regulation 
 We are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of that regulation which are material to us, and does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. To the extent particular statutory and regulatory provisions are described, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation.  Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels.  The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank, are difficult to ascertain.  In addition to laws and regulations, bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the Company or the Bank.  A change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or in the manner such laws, regulations or regulatory guidance are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s business, operations, and earnings.  Supervision, regulation, and examination of banks by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the deposit insurance fund and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than shareholders.
 Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. As described in further detail below, the Company and the Bank will become subject to additional regulatory requirements in the future as a result of the growth of their assets. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and its implementing regulations.  While there has been some changes in the post financial crisis framework applicable to the Company, primarily relating to stress testing, the Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
 We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC, as well as the rules of Nasdaq that apply to companies with securities listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
 Regulation of the Company
 We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”) and have elected to be a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, we are subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements.  Federal law subjects financial holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.
 As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage in, and be affiliated with companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company. Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or complementary to financial activities, including certain insurance underwriting activities.  We and the Bank must each remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and the Bank must receive a Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) rating of at least “Satisfactory” at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or 
 5
 

control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that financial holding company.  
 A financial holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank.  The term “source of financial strength” has been defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress.  The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in this case the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or OCC) may require reports from the Company to assess its ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source-of-strength requirements by requiring the holding company to provide financial assistance to the Bank if its capital were to become impaired.   If the Company fails to provide such assistance within three months, it could be ordered to sell its stock of the Bank to cover the deficiency.  Any capital loans by the Company to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 The BHC Act requires that a financial holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the financial holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.  The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the companies’ performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering.  We are permitted under applicable federal and state law to make out of state acquisitions and mergers of other banks and bank holding companies, subject to the requirements summarized above.
 Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company and a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Federal law also imposes restrictions on acquisitions of stock in a bank holding company or a national bank.  Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the OCC before acquiring control of any national bank, such as the Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition.  The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company’s or bank’s voting stock, or if one or more other control factors set forth in the Act are present. As a result, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.  Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.
 Regulation of the Bank
 CenterState Bank is a national bank subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC and, accordingly, the Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over the Bank.  The Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations.  These regulations include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital and liquidity ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit, requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans, limitation on the types of investment that may be made and requirements governing risk management practices. 
The Bank also is subject to restrictions on its ability to lend to and engage in other transactions with the Company and the Bank’s other affiliates.  Under these provisions, individual loans or other extensions of credit between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate generally are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and either the Company or any nonbank affiliate are limited to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and any affiliate are required to be on arm’s length terms and conditions. The definition of “extension of credit” for these purposes includes credit exposures arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement and a securities lending or borrowing transaction.  Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other 
 6
 

extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.  These restrictions have not had a material impact on the Company or the Bank.
 Federal Reserve rules require depository institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily NOW and regular checking accounts. For 2018, the first $16 million of covered balances are exempt from the reserve requirement, aggregate balances between $16 million and $122.3 million are subject to a 3% reserve requirement and aggregate balances above $122.3 million are subject to a 10% reserve requirement. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. 
 The Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines where the laws of that state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch. 
 Supervision, Examination and Enforcement
 The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC have broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with regard to bank holding companies and banks, including the power to impose nonpublic supervisory agreements, issue cease and desist or removal orders, impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, initiate injunctive actions, terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver.  In general, these actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations, as well as engagement in unsafe and unsound practices, and certain of these actions also may be taken against an “institution affiliated party” as defined in the law. Specifically, the regulators may direct a bank holding company or bank to, among other things, increase its capital, sell subsidiaries or other assets, limit its dividends and distributions, restrict its growth or remove officers and directors. Supervision and examinations are confidential, and the outcomes of these actions may not be made public.
 Changes to our Regulation and Supervision in Crossing $10 Billion in Assets Threshold
 As a result of having assets that exceed $10 billion in total consolidated assets as of start of four quarters, certain changes will occur in our supervision effective July 1, 2019, which is the date following the fourth consecutive quarter (plus any applicable phase-in period) in which the Company or the Bank’s total consolidated assets exceeded that $10 billion threshold:  
 
 
• | The calculation of the Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance assessment base will be changed and will utilize the performance score and a loss-severity score system as summarized under “FDIC Insurance Assessments.” 
• | The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) will become our supervisor with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations and will have examination authority following the fourth consecutive quarter in which the Bank’s total assets exceed $10 billion. Currently, the Bank is subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the OCC is primarily responsible for examining our compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.

 In addition, beginning on July 1, 2019, the Bank will become subject to the cap on debit card interchange fees imposed by the so-called Durbin Amendment. Under the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulations, bank issuers who are not exempt may only receive an interchange fee from merchants that is reasonable and proportional to the cost of clearing the transaction.  The maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions.  A debit card issuer may also recover $0.01 per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve.  In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product.  The impact of this change is expected to reduce the Bank’s fee income by approximately $3.5 million in year 2019 and $7 million annually, afterwards. 
 FDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference  
 The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at $250,000 for accounts under the same name and title. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system. Under this system, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly. The FDIC has published guidelines on the adjustment of assessment rates for certain institutions. In addition, insured depository institutions have been required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the Financing Corporation to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation.
 The assessment base on which the Bank’s deposit insurance premiums is paid to the FDIC is now calculated based on its average consolidated total assets less its average equity. However, effective as of July 1, 2019, the FDIC will use a performance score 
 7
 

and loss-severity score to calculate the Bank’s initial FDIC assessment rate.  In calculating these scores, the FDIC will use the Bank’s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess the Bank’s ability to withstand asset-related and funding related stress, and make certain adjustments based on risk factors that are not adequately captured in these calculations.  
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency.  Deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against insured depository institutions are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the liquidation or other resolution of that institution by any receiver appointed by federal authorities. These priority creditors include the FDIC.
 Dividend Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries and has in the past relied on dividends from the Bank as its primary source of liquidity. There are limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company, as well as by the Company to its shareholders.  
 The OCC has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by the Bank if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.  The Bank may not pay dividends from its paid-in surplus.  All dividends must be paid out of undivided profits then on hand, after deducting expenses, including reserves for losses and bad debts.  In addition, a national bank, such as the Bank, is prohibited from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus equals its stated capital, unless there has been transferred to surplus no less than one/tenth of the bank’s net profits of the preceding two consecutive half-year periods (in the case of an annual dividend).   The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus.
 We and the Bank must maintain the applicable common equity Tier 1 or CET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends.  For more information on the CET1 capital conservation buffer, see Part I Item 1. Supervision and Regulation – Capital Requirements.
 In addition, Federal Reserve policy provides that bank holding companies, such as the Company, should generally pay dividends to shareholders only if (i) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends ; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition and (iii) the organization will continue to meet minimum capital adequacy ratios.  The policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company’s capital structure. Bank holding companies also are required to consult with the Federal Reserve before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Additionally, the Federal Reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a bank holding company if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
 Capital Requirements
 We are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels at each of the Company and the Bank. The federal banking agencies have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital requirements to banking organizations they supervise. Under these requirements, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain capital standards based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The requirements also define the weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy.
 Under the applicable capital rules, the Company and the Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.  CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. For institutions, such as us, 
 8
 

that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values are also included in Tier 2 capital. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. 
 In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. For further discussion of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule, see Note 1 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
 The capital rules require a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum overall Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%. In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital) which must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. This capital conservation buffer was phased in over a four-year period that began on January 1, 2016, was 1.25% as of January 1, 2017, 1.875% as of January 1, 2018, and is 2.50% as of January 1, 2019, so that a banking organization now needs to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7%, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5% or it would be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to its executive management. 
 The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total assets, less goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.
 
To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain the following capital ratios:
  
• | CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater.
--+------------------------------------------

 
The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, the Company’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2017 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.
 Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth.
 The table below summarizes the capital requirements that the Company and the Bank must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments (i.e., the required minimum capital ratios plus the capital conservation buffer) during the remaining transition period for the capital conservation buffer:
 
 
 | Minimum Applicable Regulatory Capital Ratio Plus Capital Conservation Buffer
 | January 1, 2017 | | January 1, 2018 | | January 1, 2019
CET1 risk-based capital ratio | 5.75 | % | | 6.375 | % | 7.0 | %
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio | 7.25 | | | 7.875 | | 8.5 | 
Total risk-based capital ratio | 9.25 | | | 9.875 | | 10.5 |

As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met both the then-applicable and fully phased-in capital conservation buffer.   Please refer to the table below for a summary of the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during 2018.

Safety and Soundness Guidelines
 The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, risk management, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. These guidelines in general require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage specified risks and exposures. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and characterize compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer or employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the agencies have adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by the agency that it is not in compliance with any of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types, including those that may limit growth or capital distributions.
Lending Standards and Guidance
 The federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators’ Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies.
 The federal banking agencies have also jointly issued guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”), which defines commercial real estate loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including 1-4 family residential construction), multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a 
 10
 

significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50% or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. The required heightened risk management practices could include enhanced strategic planning, underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance states that the following metrics may indicate a concentration of commercial real estate loans, but that these metrics are neither limits nor a safe harbor: (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. As of December 31, 2018, our total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land were 55% of the Bank’s total risk based capital and our total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land were 279% of the Bank’s total risk based capital.
 Consumer Protection Laws
 The Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect its customers. These consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Administration of many of these consumer protection rules are the responsibility of the CFPB, which has exclusive supervisory authority over insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets and any affiliates thereof. The CFPB also has authority to define and prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices in the consumer financial area, and expanded data collecting powers for purposes of determining bank compliance with the fair lending laws. Because our insured depository institution, the Bank, has had less than $10 billion in total assets, we have been supervised in these areas by the OCC. The CFPB will become our exclusive supervisor in these areas following the fourth consecutive quarter where the Bank’s total assets exceed $10 billion or as of the second quarter of 2019. 
 The CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related final rules, including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages. In addition, several proposed revisions to mortgage-related rules are pending finalization. The mortgage-related final rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Company. For example, under the CFPB’s Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage rule, before making a mortgage loan, a lender must establish that a borrower has the ability to repay the mortgage. “Qualified mortgages”, as defined in the rule, are presumed to comply with this requirement and, as a result, present less litigation risk to lenders. For a loan to qualify as a qualified mortgage, the loan must satisfy certain limits on terms and conditions, pricing and a maximum debt-to-income ratio. Loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government agency or government-sponsored enterprise are exempt from some of these requirements. Satisfying the qualified mortgage standards, ensuring correct calculations are made for individual loans, recordkeeping and monitoring, as well as understanding the effect of the qualified mortgage standards on CRA obligations, impose significant new compliance obligations on, and involve compliance costs for, mortgage lenders, including the Company.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the institution, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Furthermore, the relevant federal bank regulatory agency is required to consider a bank’s CRA assessment when considering the bank’s application to, among other things, merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution or open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board is required to assess the CRA record of each subsidiary bank of any bank holding company that applies to acquire a bank or bank holding company in connection with the application. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “unsatisfactory.” The Bank received an "outstanding” rating at its most recent CRA evaluation.
Anti-Money Laundering Rules
 11
 

The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering (“AML”) program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. Among other things, these laws and regulations require the Bank to take steps to prevent the use of the Bank to facilitate the flow of illegal or illicit money, to report large currency transactions and to file suspicious activity reports. The Bank also is required to develop and implement a comprehensive AML compliance program.  Banks must also have in place appropriate “know your customer” policies and procedures. 
 Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions, and the federal banking agencies are required to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s AML activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. In addition to other bank regulatory agencies, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the state and federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, CFPB, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. 
 OFAC Regulation
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others, as defined by various Executive Orders and in various legislation. OFAC-administered sanctions take many different forms. For example, sanctions may include: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or “specially designated nationals” of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons. OFAC also publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Blocked assets, for example property and bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. If we or our Bank find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we or our Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
 Data Privacy
 Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other federal and state laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. Federal law also makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 
 Data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The CCPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The California Attorney General has not yet proposed or adopted regulations implementing the CCPA, and the California State Legislature has amended the Act since its passage. The impact of the CCPA on our business is yet to be determined.  In addition, similar laws may be adopted by other states where we do business. The federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation.
 Like other lenders, the Bank uses credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on us and our subsidiaries.
  Future Legislation and Regulation
 12
 

Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of those laws or regulations, although enactment of any significant proposal could affect how we operate and could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Competition 
 We encounter strong competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits.  In one or more aspects of its business, our Company competes with other local, regional and national financial service providers, including commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries located both within and outside our market area.  Most of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits, and may offer certain services that we do not currently provide.
Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks.  Legislation has continued to heighten the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business, and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly.
 To compete, we rely upon specialized services, responsive handling of customer needs, and personal contacts by its officers, directors, and staff. Large multi-branch banking competitors tend to compete primarily by rate and the number and location of branches while smaller, independent financial institutions tend to compete primarily by rate and personal service.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of  2,113 full-time equivalent employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We consider relations with employees to be good. 
Statistical Profile and Other Financial Data

 We also will provide without charge a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K to any shareholder by mail. Requests should be sent to CenterState Bank Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 1101 1st Street South, Winter Haven, FL 33880.
 We have adopted a Code of Ethics, which is available on our website at www.centerstatebanks.com under Investor Relations/Governance Documents, and encourage our employees to take initiative and be responsible for their actions.  The importance of maintaining our culture and communicating our core values to our stakeholders, including our employees and mentoring and training our employees as we grow is such that in 2018 we established a Board Culture Committee,  designed to tap the expertise and leadership experience of two Board members who are expert in employee engagement, training and brand development in developing a service oriented culture, committed to employee diversity, recruitment, training and motivation.  We also have adopted a formal corporate governance policy, a copy of which is available on our website at www.centerstatebanks.com.
