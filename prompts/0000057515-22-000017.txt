DESCRIPTION OF AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our financial results are presented as two reportable segments: Retail and Foodservice. Costs that are directly attributable to either Retail or Foodservice are charged directly to the appropriate segment. Costs that are deemed to be indirect, excluding corporate expenses and other unusual significant transactions, are allocated to the two reportable segments using a reasonable methodology that is consistently applied. In 2021, our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), in order to drive enhanced accountability and transparency throughout our organization, initiated a review of functional costs that had historically been part of the indirect costs allocated to our two reportable segments. This review was completed as part of our preparation for our enterprise resource planning system implementation. As a result of this review, our CODM identified certain support functions that were more appropriately presented within corporate expenses to facilitate the management of the business, including assessing segment performance and allocating resources. These changes were effective in 2021, and all historical information was retroactively conformed to the current presentation. These changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income or earnings per share. The financial information relating to our business segments for the three years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is included in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, and located in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further description of each business segment within which we operate is provided below.
Retail Segment
The following table presents the primary Retail products we manufacture and sell under our brand names:

Products | Brand Names 
Frozen Breads | 
Frozen garlic breads | New York BRAND Bakery 
Frozen Parkerhouse style yeast rolls and dinner rolls | Sister Schubert’s 
Refrigerated Dressings and Dips | 
Salad dressings | Marzetti, Simply Dressed 
Vegetable dips and fruit dips | Marzetti 
Shelf-Stable Dressings and Croutons | 
Salad dressings | Marzetti, Cardini’s, Girard’s 
Croutons and salad toppings | New York BRAND Bakery, Chatham Village, Marzetti

We also manufacture and sell other shelf-stable products pursuant to brand license agreements including Olive Garden® dressings, Buffalo Wild Wings® sauces and Chick-fil-A® sauces. Additionally, a small portion of our Retail sales are products sold under private label to retailers.
The vast majority of the products we sell in the Retail segment are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors in the United States. We have placement of products in grocery produce departments through our refrigerated salad dressings, vegetable dips and fruit dips. We also have products typically marketed in the shelf-stable section of the grocery store, which include salad dressings, slaw dressing, sauces and croutons. Within the frozen food section of the grocery store, we sell yeast rolls and garlic breads.
Our top five Retail customers accounted for 57%, 55% and 56% of this segment’s total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We continue to rely upon our strong retail brands, innovation expertise, geographic and channel expansion and customer relationships for future growth. Our category-leading retail brands and commitment to new product development help drive increased consumer demand in our Retail segment. We have also expanded Retail segment growth by leveraging our strong Foodservice customer relationships to establish exclusive licensing agreements for the retail channel. Strategic acquisitions are also part of our future growth plans, with a focus on fit and value.
Our quarterly Retail sales are affected by seasonal fluctuations, primarily in the fiscal second quarter and the Easter holiday season when sales of certain frozen retail products tend to be most pronounced. Our quarterly Retail sales can also be affected by the timing of seasonal shipments of certain fruit dips between the first and second quarters. The resulting impacts on working capital are not significant. We do not utilize any franchises or concessions. In addition to the owned and licensed trademarked brands discussed above, we also own and operate under innumerable other intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, formulas, proprietary trade secrets, technologies, know-how processes and other unregistered rights. We consider our owned and licensed intellectual property rights to be essential to our Retail business.
Foodservice Segment
The majority of our Foodservice sales are products sold under private label to restaurants. We also manufacture and sell various branded Foodservice products to distributors.
The following table presents the primary Foodservice products we manufacture and sell under our brand names:

Products | Brand Names 
Dressings and Sauces | 
Salad dressings | Marzetti, Simply Dressed
Frozen Breads and Other | 
Frozen garlic breads | New York BRAND Bakery 
Frozen Parkerhouse style yeast rolls and dinner rolls | Sister Schubert’s 
Frozen pasta | Marzetti Frozen Pasta 

The vast majority of the products we sell in the Foodservice segment are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors in the United States. Most of the products we sell in the Foodservice segment are custom-formulated and include salad dressings, sandwich and dipping sauces, frozen breads and yeast rolls. Finally, within this segment, we sold other roll products under a temporary supply agreement resulting from the November 2018 acquisition of Omni Baking Company LLC. The temporary supply agreement was terminated effective October 31, 2020.
Our top five Foodservice direct customers accounted for 58%, 61% and 59% of this segment’s total net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Within our Foodservice segment, typically our largest direct customers are distributors that distribute our products primarily to foodservice national chain restaurant accounts.
In the Foodservice segment, sales growth results from general volume gains or geographic expansion of our established customer base, and we also grow our business with existing and new customers by leveraging our culinary skills and experience to support the development of new products and menu offerings. Strategic acquisitions are also part of our future growth plans, with a focus on fit and value.
The operations of this segment are not affected to any material extent by seasonal fluctuations. We do not utilize any franchises or concessions. We own and operate under innumerable intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, formulas, proprietary trade secrets, technologies, know-how processes and other unregistered rights. We consider our owned intellectual property rights to be essential to our Foodservice business.
NET SALES ATTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
Net sales attributed to Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) totaled 18% of consolidated net sales for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Net sales attributed to McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”), a wholesale distribution subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., totaled 11%, 13% and 13% of consolidated net sales for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. McLane is a large, national distributor that sells and distributes our products to several of our foodservice national chain restaurant accounts, principally in the quick service, fast casual and casual dining channels. In general, these national chain restaurants have direct relationships with us for culinary research and development, menu development and production needs, but choose to buy our products through McLane, who acts as their distributor. McLane orders our products on behalf of these national chain restaurants, and we invoice McLane for these sales.
Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“Chick-fil-A”), one of our national chain restaurant accounts, also represents a significant portion of our consolidated net sales. We supply Chick-fil-A indirectly through distributors, including McLane. In addition, Chick-fil-A is a growing contributor to our Retail sales since we began selling their sauces to grocery retailers under an exclusive license agreement beginning in March 2020 with a regional pilot test. Retail sales of Chick-fil-A sauces have grown through geographic expansion, ultimately reaching national distribution in April 2021. Net sales attributed to Chick-fil-A, including the Retail sales resulting from the exclusive license agreement and the indirect Foodservice sales, totaled 24%, 21% and 16% of consolidated net sales for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

MANUFACTURING
As of June 30, 2022, the majority of our products were manufactured and packaged at our 15 food plants located throughout the United States. Most of these plants produce products for both the Retail and Foodservice segments. Efficient and cost-effective production remains a key focus as evidenced by our lean six sigma initiative. Certain items are also manufactured and packaged by third parties located in the United States, Canada and Europe.
COMPETITION
All of the markets in which we sell food products are highly competitive in the areas of price, quality and customer service. We face competition from a number of manufacturers of various sizes and capabilities. Our ability to compete depends upon a variety of factors, including the position of our branded goods within various categories, product quality, product innovation, promotional and marketing activity, pricing and our ability to service customers.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our business operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As a producer of food products for human consumption, our operations are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection laws. Based upon available information, compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position in 2022 and is not expected to have a material impact in 2023.
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of June 30, 2022, we had 3,200 employees. Of those employees, 24% are represented under various collective bargaining contracts and 6% are represented under a collective bargaining contract that will expire within one year.
Our people are essential to our vision to be The Better Food Company — better people, driven by purpose, making better food, in a better more collaborative culture, working in unison to make the world around us a little bit better place, every day. The honesty, integrity and sound judgment of our people in following our Code of Business Ethics are what enable us to be successful and live our company’s purpose To Nourish Growth With All That We Do.
Consistent with this purpose, our human capital management strategy emphasizes six key areas of focus: Health and Safety; Talent Acquisition; Compensation and Benefits; Employee Engagement; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”); and Community Engagement. Our Board of Directors oversees this strategy and dedicates one Board meeting each year to a full review of talent.
Health and Safety
The health and well-being of our employees is paramount to the success of our business, and we are proud to be leaders in our industry with respect to our safety record and safety initiatives. Our approach to occupational health and safety centers around three elements: training, response, and tracking. We maintain a rigorous safety training program that ensures employees throughout the organization are regularly trained in every aspect of workplace safety. Management personnel with direct responsibility for safety oversight also receive comprehensive professional training and the opportunity for certification.
Talent Acquisition
We strive to attract and retain talented people by providing a great place to work. We have built a collaborative and purpose-driven culture that attracts people who share our vision to be The Better Food Company. In addition, we are committed to nourishing the growth of our employees by providing training and development opportunities to pursue their career paths and to ensure compliance with our policies. Our focus on our employees also extends beyond the workplace – we genuinely want to help our people to thrive both personally and professionally through a healthy work-life balance.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer our employees competitive fixed and/or variable pay along with a Total Rewards package which typically includes medical, prescription, dental and life insurance benefits, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, disability coverage, a 401(k) plan, and various employee assistance programs.
We continue to work to expand our Total Rewards program to strengthen our focus on work/life effectiveness and holistic well-being, which includes physical, financial, emotional, and social well-being. We have undertaken external benchmarking to ensure our compensation and benefits packages remain competitive.
Employee Engagement
To keep our employees engaged and fulfilled in their roles, we have sought to establish a continuous feedback loop between our employees and company leadership. We communicate consistently with our people via a range of channels, including town hall meetings, regular updates, and key announcements. Each year, we invite our employees to respond to our annual employee engagement survey and share their views on a range of workplace questions. Based on feedback from the survey, management develops and implements plans to address the primary areas of opportunity that have been identified by employees.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We foster a collaborative working environment where all our employees can thrive and feel they belong. We believe our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging enhances our ability to attract and retain a high-performing and diverse team. We monitor the diversity of our organization to identify areas of improvement, advance our DEI strategy and measure the effectiveness of our efforts. Our goal is to establish a continuous improvement trend. In 2022, our workforce was 35% female and 46% of our employees represented minority races or ethnicities.
In 2020, we adopted our Diversity Hiring Statement, which sets out our pledge to include women and minority candidates in the pool of candidates for new leadership positions. We have already seen a positive impact, with 27% of our leadership team representing diverse backgrounds in 2022, up from 15% in 2019 before we implemented the policy. 
To unlock opportunities for high school students from diverse backgrounds, we have committed to a work-study program that provides tuition support and work-study mentorship to high school students from low-income families.
We also encourage employee-led initiatives to promote diversity within the organization. Several employee resource groups have been established in the last few years. These affinity-based groups provide a support network for colleagues from diverse backgrounds and help to raise awareness of DEI topics. We have also identified Diversity & Inclusion Champions on our leadership team to ensure top-down accountability for our DEI initiatives.
Community Engagement
Our volunteering and philanthropic efforts align with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on reducing poverty and food insecurity while promoting good health and quality education for all. In 2022, our teams mobilized to support Pelotonia, Toys for Tots, and the United Way. We regularly donate funds and volunteer time to a range of other community organizations and foundations as well, including the Children’s Hunger Alliance, Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, Jobs for America’s Graduates, and local food banks.
RAW MATERIALS
During 2022, we experienced some disruptions to our sourcing of raw materials and packaging. We secured additional second-sourcing options to help limit the risk of supply disruptions. We rely on a variety of raw materials and packaging for the day-to-day production of our products, including soybean oil, various sweeteners, eggs, dairy-related products, flour, various films and plastic and paper packaging materials.
We purchase the majority of these materials on the open market to meet current requirements, but we also have some fixed-price contracts with terms generally one year or less. See further discussion in the “Risk Factors” section below and the “Financial Condition” section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”). Although the availability and price of certain of these materials are influenced by weather, disease and the level of global demand, we anticipate that future sources of supply for 2023 will generally be available and adequate for our needs.
