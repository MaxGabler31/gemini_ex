Item 1. Business
Our Company
i3 Verticals builds, acquires and grows software solutions in strategic vertical markets. Our broad array of specialized solutions meet our customers’ specific enterprise needs which leads to long-term partnerships. Our payments platform seamlessly integrates into our solutions, unlocking additional value.
Revenue from software and related services accounts for 49% of our total revenue in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, up from 5% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2017.
Since founding in 2012, we have steadily increased our market share and solution breadth through a combination of organic growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our compounding cash flow generation has positioned us to capitalize on strategic opportunities and position ourselves to expand our product offerings for years to come. 
We focus on strategic vertical markets where we can build lasting customer relationships. Our primary markets are underserved, fragmented, large, and growing. Our primary strategic vertical markets include:
•Public Sector—We have products and solutions that create an efficient flow of information throughout a variety of public sector entities, including states and local governments. Our solutions help our customers provide more responsive and efficient services to their citizens. We have products that enable upper and lower court case management, collections, finance and accounting, motor vehicle and carrier registration, e-filing and taxation, license plate inventory, property tax management, utility billing, professional licensing, document workflow, and law enforcement software. We deliver integrated payments solutions throughout many of these products and these solutions allow our customers to efficiently process court, tax, registration, utility and other payments. We also assist public schools in completing payment processing functions such as accepting payments for school lunches (online or at school) and school activities. 
•Healthcare—We provide businesses in our Healthcare vertical with software platforms for revenue cycle management, including coding, insurance adjudication, billing, scheduling and integrated payments. Our solutions help our customers efficiently code and bill for their services, and ultimately receive reimbursement. We offer our software as a service and bundle it with professional services that specialize in outsourced revenue cycle management. We also offer electronic health records ("EHR") solutions and often pair these with our revenue cycle management services. Our payment solutions in the healthcare market seamlessly integrate into our own proprietary software, as well as that of our distribution partners, consisting of independent software vendors (“ISVs”). We also provide workflow software and associated professional services to medical insurance payers.
 A core component of our growth strategy includes a disciplined approach to acquisitions of companies and technology, evidenced by more than 47 acquisitions since our inception in 2012. Our acquisitions have opened new strategic vertical markets, increased the number of businesses and organizations to whom we provide solutions and extended our existing software solutions and capabilities. We target vertical markets where businesses and organizations often lack integrated payment functionality within their business management systems. When we present software solutions that integrate the customer's operations with their payments, we can build a long-term relationship primed to grow together. Our management team has significant experience acquiring and integrating vertical market software businesses that complement our existing suite of products and solutions. Due to our team’s longstanding relationships and domain expertise, we maintain a strong pipeline of acquisition targets and are constantly evaluating businesses against our acquisition criteria.
We generate revenue from software licenses and subscriptions, ongoing support, and other software-related solutions. We also generate revenue from volume-based fees generated by payment processing services provided to customers throughout North America. Our software and integrated payment solutions coupled with our distribution network derive significant scale from operating efficiencies, which enables us to generate strong operating margins and cash flows.

The platform APIs allow access to Europay, Mastercard and Visa (“EMV”) devices using an 
implementation that shields software providers from the requirements of PCI or payment application data security standard certifications.
Our Technology
Our technology offerings are architected and delivered utilizing a variety of strategies designed to maximize business value for customers. Software is delivered via agile development methodologies allowing for immediate customer feedback. Our cloud-first strategy takes advantage of cost-effective, secure, and scalable infrastructures. We focus intently on cybersecurity and we proactively work to continuously improve the security of customer information and our internal systems. We leverage test automation and automated deployment tools to ensure seamless, high quality software deployments.
Agile Development
Our software development lifecycle has been designed to incorporate agile methodologies that are intended to maximize business value to our customers as well as create an environment for continuous feedback. This feedback is rapidly incorporated into our product backlogs and prioritized for development. Quality assurance is incorporated into the process from the beginning, allowing for high quality technology delivery.
Cloud First Strategy
We have both public cloud and private cloud solutions. Our primary public cloud provider is AWS. However, we also leverage Microsoft and Google to deliver our technology across multiple cloud platforms. Our strategy is focused on leveraging Platforms as a Service whenever possible to ensure the highest level of scalability at a lower cost level. In situations where the public cloud is not a fit, we have a private cloud solution to host our technology. The public cloud spans multiple data centers across the country. Within each data center, we have implemented a highly available infrastructure utilizing a variety of cybersecurity tools to ensure systems are always on and highly secured.
Low code 
We have recently identified low code partner. We intend to deploy this leading-edge technology to efficiently build critical technology for customers at a lower cost and at a more rapid pace.
Automation
We are investing heavily in technology automation. This allows us to bring changes to the marketplace much faster than traditional mechanisms. Additionally, we continue to invest in test automation, which reduces the risk of quality issues while improving overall test coverage. These two technologies help enable the delivery of new technology with high levels of quality.
Our Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy includes both direct W2 sales representatives and a broad network of distribution partners.
We utilize our direct sales team, our largest channel, to sell our proprietary software and payment technology solutions directly to customers in our vertical markets. Sales teams are organized and coordinated by vertical, leading to extensive cross-selling opportunities across our broad array of solutions. Leveraging our vertically focused suite of products and services, we are able to maximize the performance of our direct W2 sales force, and our external distribution channels, as we continue to attract new partners.
Our external channel partners are comprised of ISVs, value-added resellers (“VARs”) and a few select independent sales organizations (“ISOs”). These distribution partners are a consistent and scalable source for new customer acquisition. 
Our product and partner marketing is delivered through a shared-services model which is coordinated with each business unit. Marketing is tightly aligned with our sales efforts by providing event coordination, demand generation resources, physical and electronic marketing campaigns and partner marketing collateral. Our enterprise marketing function establishes our overall corporate marketing strategy to enhance brand awareness and demand generation. We use a broad variety of traditional and digital marketing mediums to engage prospective customers.
Our Operations 
Our operations team is uniquely structured to optimize the experience of our customers and distribution partners. These vertically focused business support teams allow us to establish a level of expertise that delivers a scalable support structure and enables us to align our services with the economic goals and specific expectations of the respective business unit. Each operations team is positioned to support the functions of their respective customer base and key performance indicators mark their progress toward achieving the goals established by each business unit. A strong network of shared services, such as marketing, legal, finance and HR, support our decentralized operating units and ensure that they are focused on the best in-class service to our customers. Our corporate technology department is structured to rapidly enhance and effectively maintain our products and services.
Our operations team is structured to effectively support the individual needs of our customers. This support includes:
•customer onboarding and data conversions;
•software configurations and integrations;
•customer support and retention;
•customer training and activations;
•billing and financial review; 
•credit underwriting and risk management;
•payment processing support; and
•end-user customer support.
Our technical operations team oversees the execution of development, quality control, delivery and support for our vertical software and payment processing applications. Applications are developed and tested according to the software development lifecycle, composed of iterative development and testing with a dedicated focus on planning and execution. Releases are modeled on continuous deployment and added to the live environment on a routine basis. Each application stack is built with redundancy to foster resiliency and built to be easily managed during a disaster recovery scenario. The entire solution is hosted within a managed, dedicated environment that is certified PCI-compliant to protect all personal and transactional data.
Our Competition 
We compete with a variety of vertical market software providers that have different business models, go-to-market strategies and technical capabilities. We believe the most significant competitive factors in our markets are: 
1.quality, including the ability of our products and solutions to addresses the specific needs of our customers;
2.service, including our ability to bring value-added solutions and strong customer support;
3.trust, including a strong reputation for quality service and trusted distribution partners; 
4.convenience, such as speed in customer onboarding and approving applications; 
5.pricing, including fees charged to customers and residuals and incentives offered to distribution partners. 
Our competitors range from large and well established companies to smaller, earlier-stage businesses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— The vertical market software and payment processing industries are highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the revenue we receive, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Human Capital
To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make i3 Verticals a safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation and benefits programs and opportunities for advancement.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we provide our eligible employees with access to flexible and convenient medical programs intended to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In addition to standard medical coverage, for our domestic employees, we offer dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, flexible work schedules on a case-by-case basis, employee assistance programs, voluntary short term and long-term disability insurance and term life insurance. For our non-U.S. employees, in addition to standard medical coverage, we offer benefits that are consistent with local practices for similarly situated companies.
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary across our businesses) include bonus opportunities and, for our domestic employees, a 401(k) Plan. We use targeted stock option grants and restricted stock units ("RSUs") with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, and we are proud that a large percentage of our workforce owns i3 Verticals shares, RSUs or options to purchase i3 Verticals shares. We believe this dynamic aligns important economic incentives and encourages an entrepreneurial spirit.
We have built a collaborative culture that recognizes and rewards innovation and offers employees a variety of opportunities and experiences. We believe that our culture is critical to our success. The majority of our employees work on-site in one of our over 40 offices; however, we encourage our employees to take advantage of our flexible work arrangements to meet their individual circumstances. We are an acquisitive company and regularly add new employees and locations as a result of our acquisition activity. Our employee headcount has significantly increased since our Initial Public Offering in June 2018, and as of November 17, 2022, we have approximately 1,637 employees in 43 states and two countries. We believe that our employee retention rates are competitive and we think this is a result of strong emphasis on workforce culture in our acquisition process and in our operational decision making. 
Government Regulation 
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations and the rules and standards of the payment networks that we utilize to provide our electronic payment services, as more fully described below. 
Dodd-Frank Act
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the related rules and regulations have resulted in significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Changes impacting the electronic payment industry include providing merchants with the ability to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers. New rules also contain certain prohibitions on payment network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions of debit card transactions. Additionally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the interchange fees that certain issuers charge merchants for debit transactions will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transactions. Rules released by the Federal Reserve in July 2011 to implement the Durbin Amendment mandate a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for issuers with assets of $10 billion or greater. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which has assumed responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has the authority to determine whether any non-bank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System because it is systemically important to the U.S. financial system. Any new rules or regulations implemented by the CFPB or the Financial Stability Oversight Council or in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to us, or any changes that are adverse to us resulting from litigation brought by third parties challenging such rules and regulations, could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities. 
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
We provide services that are subject to privacy laws and regulations of a variety of jurisdictions. Relevant federal privacy laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of 
financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Our business also may be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, which regulate the use and reporting of consumer credit information and impose disclosure requirements on entities who take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. All fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted data breach notification laws requiring businesses that experience a security breach of their computer databases that contain personal information to notify affected individuals, consumer reporting agencies and governmental agencies. In addition, there are state laws that restrict the ability to collect and utilize certain types of personal information, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, and impose secure disposal requirements for personal data. Certain state laws mandate businesses to implement reasonable data security measures. Massachusetts requires any business that processes the personal information of a Massachusetts resident to adopt and implement a written information security program. States are increasingly legislating data protection requirements for a broader list of personal data and are strengthening protections for students' personal information. For example, Illinois regulates the collection of biometric information under its Biometric Information Privacy Act, and at least five other states have legislation pending regarding the collection of biometric data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, requires companies that process personal information of California residents to make certain disclosures to consumers about data practices, grants consumers specific access rights to their data, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing activities and creates a private right of action for data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), which will come into effect on January 1, 2023, but applies to certain personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, amends and expands the CCPA to create additional consumer privacy rights, such as the right of correction and right to limit the use of sensitive personal information, and establishes a privacy enforcement agency known as the California Privacy Protection Agency (the “CPPA”). In addition, various states, including Colorado, Virginia, Utah, and Connecticut, have enacted, and other states are expected to enact in the near future, new laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security. To the extent we are subject to such legislation, the potential effects on our business are often far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties or fines for violations. Each privacy law and regulation that applies to us could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities. We are also subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. See “—Healthcare Regulatory Matters” below. 
As an entity that provides services to educational institutions, we are indirectly subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and the privacy requirements of the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose or use any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than on a basis and in a manner permitted under the statutes. See “Risk Factors—If we violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our customers in our Education vertical and could harm our reputation. Further, if we disclose student information in violation of FERPA or PPRA, our access to student information could be suspended.
Healthcare Regulatory Matters
Our Healthcare vertical business provides services to healthcare providers who are highly regulated and subject to frequently changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Although some regulatory requirements do not directly apply to our operations, these requirements affect the business of our healthcare customers and the demand for our services. 
Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our Healthcare vertical operations and financial condition. U.S. federal, state, local laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change.
In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate, and in some instances also through private civil litigation. 
Examples of the most significant of these laws include, but are not limited to, the following:
HIPAA Privacy and Security Requirements
There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (known as “protected health information”) and require covered entities, including health plans and most healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. In addition, the HIPAA administrative simplification provisions require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards of healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically.
Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. As a provider of services to entities subject to HIPAA, we are a “business associate” of our customers and must safeguard the protected health information we handle. To the extent permitted by applicable regulations and contracts and associated business associate agreements with our customers, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in substantial civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) enforces the privacy and security regulations, and state attorneys general may also enforce the regulations in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. To the extent we are permitted under our customer contracts, we may de-identify protected health information and use de-identified information for our purposes without obtaining patient authorization or further complying with HIPAA. Determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the HIPAA privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses. Any failure by us to meet HIPAA requirements with respect to de-identification could subject us to penalties and harm our reputation.
Other Privacy and Security Requirements
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. federal and state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information. In many cases, state laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA, and may allow personal rights of action with respect to privacy or security breaches, as well as fines. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, a number of states have introduced or passed legislation relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data. Congress is also currently considering a comprehensive national data privacy and security law that may be broader than or supplant state consumer privacy laws.
Data Protection and Breaches
Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards, and all states have laws that require such holders to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the state’s attorney general. In some states, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. The laws are inconsistent across states, which can increase the costs of compliance. Additionally, HIPAA imposes certain notification requirements on business associates. In certain circumstances involving large breaches, media notice is required. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the business associate or covered entity establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with the risk assessment requirements enumerated under HIPAA. 
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. The FTC has prosecuted certain data breach cases as unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, the FTC regulations require creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, 
prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. Although Congress passed legislation that restricts the definition of “creditor” and exempts many healthcare providers from complying with this identity theft prevention rule, we may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule.
Information Blocking and Interoperability Requirements
Government initiatives promoting interoperability of electronic health information ("EHI") have driven increasing demand among customers, industry groups, and patients for health information technology ("HIT") products that are compatible with one another and capable of facilitating access, exchange, and use of EHI without delay or other interference. For example, the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology ("ONC") and HHS published a final rule in 2020, implementing provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act ("The Cures Act"), that prohibits health care providers, health information exchanges ("HIEs"), and HIT developers from information blocking (“Information Blocking Final Rule”). As an electronic medical record provider, one of our subsidiaries is considered to be a HIT developer and is, therefore, subject to the Information Blocking Final Rule.
Information Blocking is defined under the Cures Act as a practice that is likely to interfere with, prevent or materially discourage access, exchange or use of EHI. The Information Blocking Final Rule outlines the kinds of industry behaviors that constitute information blocking, along with certain exceptions for practices that would not be considered information blocking. HIT developers are subject to a higher standard than health care providers in terms of determining whether a practice constitutes information blocking, in that an action that the HIT developer knows or should know is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI may be considered information blocking. Additionally, HIT developers are subject to penalties for information blocking of up to $1 million per violation. The Information Blocking Final Rule applied to HIT developers with at least one HIT tool that is ONC Certified HIT and we have at least one product - iMed EMR - that is ONC Certified HIT.
In 2020, ONC published a final rule that imposes HIT technology standards, implementation specifications, certification criteria, and conditions and maintenance of certification requirements that apply to HIT developers (“HIT Standards and Certification Criteria Final Rule”). The HIT Standards and Certification Criteria Final Rule includes new criteria related to EHI export and standardized APIs for patient services. As a result of this rule, HIT developers of certified HIT need to ensure that their products and services meet the requisite technical standards by the relevant deadlines, which roll out through 2024, and that their HIT continues to evolve as developers and other stakeholders release revised versions of these standards. In addition, to participate in the ONC Health IT Certification Program, HIT developers must make various certifications regarding their HIT, and attest to compliance with applicable conditions of certification, including those related to information blocking.
In 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") published the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, which, among other things, requires hospitals with certain EHR capabilities to send admission, discharge, and transfer notifications to other providers, and imposes requirements on certain payors to support Patient Access and Provider Directory APIs. While not directly applicable to HIT developers, the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule further demonstrates the government’s drive toward interoperability of EHI and the resulting need of healthcare providers and other consumers of HIT for tools that meet these requirements.
In January of 2022, ONC published the Trusted Exchange Framework, Common Agreement - Version 1 ("TEFCA"), and Qualified Health Information Network ("QHIN") Technical Framework - Version 1. The overall goal of the TEFCA is to establish a universal floor for interoperability across the country. The TEFCA will establish the infrastructure model and governing approach for users in different networks to securely share basic clinical information with each other—all under commonly agreed-to expectations and rules, agnostic to the network in which they participate. The Trusted Exchange Framework describes a common set of non-binding, foundational principles for trust policies and practices that can help facilitate exchange among HINs. Although implementation of the Trusted Exchange Framework is not mandatory, the federal government encourages its adoption through the establishment of a publicly available directory of networks that are capable of trusted exchange and by permitting federal agencies to require implementation of the Trusted Exchange Framework by network contractors as the contractors update their health IT or operational practices.
Anti-Kickback Laws
A number of federal and state laws govern patient referrals, financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and inducements to providers and patients, including restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”). The AKS prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, anything of value with the intent of generating referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Courts have interpreted the law broadly and held that there is violation of the statute if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. Actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it is not required to commit a violation. Violation of the AKS is a felony, and penalties for AKS violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil penalties with treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, submission of a claim or services or items generated in violation of the AKS may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act ("FCA").
The AKS contains a limited number of exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) of HHS has created regulatory safe harbors to the AKS. Activities that comply with a safe harbor are deemed protected from prosecution under the AKS. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not automatically render an arrangement illegal under the AKS. The arrangement, however, does risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, based on our particular facts and circumstances. Our contracts and other arrangements may not meet an exception or a safe harbor. Additionally, many states have similar anti-kickback laws or laws that otherwise prohibit fraudulent or abusive arrangements within the healthcare industry. These laws are often broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payment for care.
Although we believe that our relationships with referral sources and recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, we cannot provide assurance that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the AKS or other applicable laws. 
False or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding
Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance. We provide billing and coding services, claims processing and other solutions to providers that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of health services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal and state healthcare programs and private payers. These services may be subject us to, or we may be contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent claims including but not limited to the FCA, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law ("CMP Law"), and state equivalents. We rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so.
The FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly to include not only actual knowledge of a claim’s falsity, but also reckless disregard of the truth of the information, or deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of a claim. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The FCA may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government's behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors and billing for services not rendered. Further, submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial civil penalties for each false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Exclusion from Participation in Government Healthcare Programs
The OIG is required to or may choose to exclude individuals and entities involved in misconduct related to federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, from participation in those programs. Federal law prohibits federal healthcare programs from paying for items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by an individual or entity excluded from participation. The prohibition against federal program payment extends to payment for administrative and management services not directly related to patient care. Civil penalties may be imposed against providers and entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded individuals or entities to provide items or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries and submit a claim for reimbursement to a 
federal healthcare program, or cause such a claim to be submitted. In addition to civil monetary penalties, violations may result in exclusion and treble damages, for each item or service furnished during the period in which the individual or entity was excluded. Our customers have an affirmative duty to check the exclusion status of individuals and entities prior to entering into contractual relationships and periodically re-check thereafter. We have implemented compliance policies and procedures to screen for excluded individuals. However, if we are found to have employed or contracted with an excluded individual or entity, we could face significant consequences as outlined above. In addition, we could be liable under our customer contracts if we are excluded by the OIG or employ or contract with an excluded individual or entity.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Regulation 
Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which we refer to collectively as the “BSA.” The BSA, among other things, requires money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or transactions dealing with) specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, such as those who might be narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address related legal and regulatory requirements and developments. 
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices
We and many of our customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, laws prohibiting these activities and other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, may directly impact the activities of certain of our customers, and in some cases may subject us, as the customer’s payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the customer through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the states attorneys general, have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments or providing services for a customer that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. 
In addition, the CFPB has recently attempted to extend certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prevent the employment of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) to payment processors. Though there is still litigation involving whether payment processing companies are subject to these requirements (and the extent of their application), these requirements may apply or be applicable in the future. UDAAPs could involve omissions or misrepresentations of important information to consumers or practices that take advantage of vulnerable consumers, such as elderly or low-income consumers.
Stored Value Services
Stored value cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations related to consumer and data protection, licensing, consumer disclosures, escheat, anti-money laundering, banking, trade practices and competition and wage and employment. The customers who utilize the gift card processing products and services that we may sell may be subject to these laws and regulations. In the future, if we seek to expand these stored value card products and services, or as a result of regulatory changes, we may be subject to additional regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registrations which we may not be able to obtain. 
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “Card Act”) created new requirements applicable to general-use prepaid gift cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates. The Card Act, along with the Federal Reserve’s amended Regulation E, created new requirements with respect to these cards and electronic certificates. These include certain prohibited features and revised disclosure obligations. Prepaid services may also be subject to the rules and regulations of Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express and other payment networks with which our customers and the card issuers do business. The customers who utilize the gift card processing products and services that we may sell are responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and requirements relating to their gift product program. 
Additionally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”), issued a final rule in July 2011 regarding the applicability of the BSA’s regulations to “prepaid access” products and services. This rulemaking clarifies the anti-money laundering obligations for entities engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid services, such as prepaid gift cards. We are not registered with FinCEN based on our determination that our current products and services do not constitute a “prepaid program” as defined in the BSA and we are not a “provider” of prepaid access. We may in the future need to register with FinCEN as a “money services business-provider of prepaid access” in accordance with the rule based on changes to our products or services. 
Indirect Regulatory Requirements
Certain of our distribution partners are financial institutions that are directly subject to various regulations and compliance obligations issued by the CFPB, the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies responsible for regulating financial institutions, which includes state financial institution regulators. While these regulatory requirements and compliance obligations do not apply directly to us, many of these requirements materially affect the services we provide to our customers and us overall. The financial institution regulators have imposed requirements on regulated financial institutions to manage their third-party service providers. Among other things, these requirements include performing appropriate due diligence when selecting third-party service providers; evaluating the risk management, information security, and information management systems of third-party service providers; imposing contractual protections in agreements with third-party service providers (such as performance measures, audit and remediation rights, indemnification, compliance requirements, confidentiality and information security obligations, insurance requirements, and limits on liability); and conducting ongoing monitoring, diligence and audits of the performance of third-party service providers. Accommodating these requirements applicable to our customers imposes additional costs and risks in connection with our financial institution relationships. We expect to expend significant resources on an ongoing basis in an effort to assist our customers in meeting their legal requirements. 
Payment Network Rules and Standards
Payment networks establish their own rules and standards that allocate liabilities and responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the PCI DSS, govern a variety of areas of the payments industry, including how we can process transactions, how consumers and customers may use their cards, how our customers may conduct their business regarding the acceptance of payments (including the types and amounts of fees that can be assessed for the acceptance of payments), the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Changes to these rules and standards could alter or prohibit certain current industry business practices which could impact our ability to provide services to various market segments we service. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine, penalize or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards. 
An example of a such a standard is the “chip and pin” or “chip and signature” card requirement, known as EMV, which was mandated by Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover to be supported by payment processors by April 2013 and by merchants by October 2015. This mandate set new requirements and technical standards, including requiring integrated point of sale systems to be capable of accepting the more secure “chip” cards that utilize the EMV standard and setting new rules for data handling and security. Processors and customers that do not comply with the mandate or do not use systems that are EMV compliant risk fines and liability for fraud-related losses. We have invested significant resources to ensure our systems’ compliance with the mandate, and to assist our customers in becoming compliant.
To provide our electronic payment services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as a service provider with each of the payment networks that we utilize. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for primary membership in certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, and are therefore unable to directly access these networks. The operating regulations of certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider. We are registered with certain payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, through various sponsor banks. The agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for customers and the terms of our agreements with customers. We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) relating to payment transactions we process using the ACH Network. Like the card networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time and we will be subject to these changes. For example, NACHA's WEB Debit Account Validation Rule, took effect March 19, 2021. This rule requires changes to ACH validation of bank accounts associated with internet WEB ACH payments. The NACHA Operating Rules and Guidelines allocate responsibility and liabilities to the various participants in the payment network, including us and our partner financial institutions. Recently, NACHA has focused upon data security and privacy responsibilities. We are subject to audit by our partner financial institutions for compliance with the rules and guidelines. Our sponsor financial institutions have substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including the terms of our agreements with our ACH processing customers.
Money Transmitter Regulation
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments, including some of the prepaid products we may sell.
In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. These states not only regulate and control money transmitters, but they also license entities engaged in the transmission of funds. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations. Many states require, among other things, that proceeds from money transmission activity and payment instrument sales be invested in high-quality marketable securities before the settlement of the transactions or otherwise restrict the use and safekeeping of such funds. Such licensing laws also may cover matters such as regulatory approval of consumer forms, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain specified levels of net worth. Many states also require money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments, and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
Other Regulation
We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as account balances that are due to a distribution partner or customer following discontinuation of its relationship with us. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements. 
The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations to which we are subject and the regulatory framework governing our business is changing continuously. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     
Our Intellectual Property
Certain of our products and services are based on proprietary software and related payment systems solutions.
