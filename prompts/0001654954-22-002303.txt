ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General

374Water, Inc. (the “Company”, “374Water”, “We”, or “Our”) is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated on September 8, 2005. The Company was initially formed to develop, commercialize, and market a series of unique electric generating power systems designed to produce electrical power with zero emissions or waste byproducts, based on a patented pressure-driven expander motor and related organic rankine cycle technology.

 On April 16, 2021, 374Water Inc. (f/k/a PowerVerde, Inc.) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger”) with 374Water, Inc., a privately held company based in Durham, North Carolina, (“374Water Private Company”) and 374Water Acquisition Corp., a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of PowerVerde. Subsequent to the merger, 374Water Inc. became the surviving entity. 

As a result of the Merger, the former 374Water Private Company shareholders own 65.8% of our issued and outstanding common stock and 53.8% of our issued and outstanding voting stock (which includes the preferred stock on an as converted basis).

Subsequent to the Merger, 374Water is focused on being a cleantech and social impact company providing a disruptive technology that addresses imminent environmental pollution challenges. We are focused on a new era of sustainable waste stream management that promotes circular economy initiatives and enables organizations to achieve sustainability goals and create green impact. Our vision is a world without waste and our mission is to preserve a clean and healthy environment that sustains life.

We have developed proprietary waste stream treatment systems based on Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO). The term used for the process is AirSCWOTM. SCWO leverages the unique properties of water in its supercritical phase (above 374oC and 221 Bar) to convert organic matter to energy and safe products that can be recovered and used. The AirSCWOTM systems are essentially waste stream agnostic and able to treat a variety of complex, hazardous and non-hazardous waste streams, opening up opportunities for multiple applications in diverse market verticals on an international scale. Most pertinently, the technology is shifting the landscape in addressing environmental challenges that, until now, have been considered unsurmountable (due to science/engineering or cost barriers), one good example being the global PFAS crisis.

We currently outsource manufacturing the AirSCWOTM systems to our strategic partner in the US, Merrell Bros., Inc., that have the facilities and capability to rapidly ramp-up manufacturing volumes and also support system modifications and deployment as required per market and clients. We envision in the future applying an outsourced manufacturing model in a few territories, and may consider establishing our own manufacturing capability in geographies where this is needed to adequately grow our market share.

The systems are supplied to multiple market verticals, and our revenue model includes both capital equipment sales and long-term service agreements based on throughput and capacity (Waste Purchase Agreements). Our market penetration strategy is combined of direct client and channel partner sales routes, depending on the specific market and territory. In some cases, the systems may be white labelled and sold as part of a broader solution package. 

Human Capital and Culture

We currently employ seven full-time employees and ten consultants on a full or part-time basis. Our current projections are to increase the workforce to twelve full-time employees in 2022 and forty full-time employees in 2023. 

We recognize and value our people as our most important asset in achieving our strategic goals and growing a great company. We are working towards a human resources strategy that will help drive the right culture, leadership, talent management, performance, reward and recognition, personal development, and ways of working vital to ensure the Company achieves its strategic goals whilst our people benefit from an exceptional experience.

Our focus areas in creating a working environment that draws out the best in our employees and allows them to fulfil their potential and support the Company to attain its goals are as follows:


1) | Attract, identify, develop and retain high-performing talent across all areas. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Develop and support the growth of leadership. 
3) | Enable the development of a high-performance culture in which staff performance can be supported, rewarded, enhanced and managed effectively. 
4) | Foster a values-based culture focused on diversity, inclusivity, wellbeing and positive staff engagement. 
5) | Develop a total reward approach which is valued by staff and facilitates organisational objectives. 
6) | Provide excellent core HR, professional development and health and safety services across all business areas to enable the effective operation of the organisation.


Our recruitment strategy is based on identifying top talent, predominantly via existing networks and referrals, and offering competitive remuneration packages that combine salary, benefits and equity. As we move forward our recruitment strategy will expand to wider platforms allowing outreach to a wider audience. In the immediate future, we will use an outsourced human resources firm, and as we grow, within 2022, embed a human resources function into the Company. We intend to apply a wide range of retention initiatives that include rewarding high-performance, and opening opportunities for progression and career development. Identification of high-performing talent will be linked to succession planning and development of the future-workforce will be embedded in employee professional development schemes. 


5


We are setting clear standards with respect to generating an open and transparent working environment in which everyone has a voice. This will invoke effective personal development discussions and provide the opportunity to conduct performance reviews supported by transparent data and open conversation.

We are dedicated to embedding Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) as an important part of developing our culture through delivery of innovative initiatives and internal workshops, ensuring that D&I policies touch on all aspects of the Company from recruitment practices to company behaviour/operating frameworks. These policies will also be reviewed periodically as required and updated accordingly. 

Moving forward we intend to deliver a total reward strategy which appropriately supports achievement of organisational aims and priorities, and will help position us as an employer of choice which employees value and understand. This will undergo periodical review to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent in a financially sustainable way.

All of our human resource initiatives will be supported by key performance indicators to monitor their effectiveness and gain insight into gaps that can be addressed quickly and ensure our overall human resource strategy is adapted as required and maintained to a high degree.

Markets and Industries

                Due to the nature of the technology and its ability to treat effectively diverse waste streams, applicable to different industries, the markets that the Company serves are broad. The Company’s technology provides a unique value proposition promoting its adoption across markets, and includes but is not limited to: 

· | Generating value from waste by recovering clean energy, water, and minerals 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Providing a highly energy efficient and sustainable treatment option delivering unprecedented elimination of many environmentally persistent pollutants, that current technologies are not able to efficiently treat. These include, as examples, but are not limited to: PFAS, 1,4 Dioxane, microplastics, PPCPs, and CECs
· | Treating waste at the source thereby eliminating haulage and transportation needs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
· | Offsetting methane emissions by offering a solution to waste that does not form methane as a by-product (unlike conventional waste treatment technologies) 


                One of our key markets is the sludge treatment market, which includes both municipal and industrial sludge. Sludge is the semi solid by-product obtained from wastewater treatment. When it is produced from the treatment of domestic sewage it is considered municipal sludge whilst sludge obtained as by-product from industrial chemicals and waste treatment is referred to as industrial sludge. Activated sludge is the most commonly applied biological treatment process for the treatment of municipal sewage. It generates a final residue also known as biosolids as it mainly consists of biological solids. Sludge and biosolids management is a key part of any wastewater treatment process.

                The global demand for municipal and industrial sludge treatment is expected to generate revenue of above $9 Billion by end of 2026, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 5.7% between 2020 and 2026 (Research and Markets Report, August 2020). Growing population has resulted in increased volume of sludge which drives the market for municipal and industrial sludge treatment. Moreover, escalating energy costs from conventional sources prompts the use of biogas which in turn is expected to trigger the municipal sludge treatment market in the near future. 

The municipal sludge market is expected to comprise approximately 40% of the Company’s revenue, particularly due to its size, regulatory drivers related to emerging contaminants, evolving land application limitations/restrictions and ever-increasing sludge volumes that require treatment (Sludge at WWTPs: Global Trends of Treatment and Disposal/Reuse, The World Bank 2019). However, additional high value markets are being addressed and will contribute to the Company’s revenue and thereby help fuel its growth plans. Table 1 below shows a non-exhaustive list of target markets, their subsegments, and the relevant applications associated with those markets.

Waste Management | Recycling CentersIncineratorsLandfills | Landfill leachate, food waste, waste oils; Fats, Oil & Greases (FOG), hazardous and non-hazardous organic waste.
Sanitation Projects in developing countries | Regional centralized facilities, decentralized treatment facilities (villages, schools) | Municipal sludge and biosolids, mixed wastes 


                The markets shown represent multi billions in Total Addressable Market (TAM) value, with typical 5-year CAGRs of between 5%-8%. 

                The trends that are transforming these markets, and dictating a more robust and sustainable approach to waste stream management are derived from recognition by waste generators, waste operators, government and society that they are key social, environmental and economic benefits to be gained by moving waste up the waste management hierarchy, towards prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery. The drivers that are facilitating adoption of our technology include but are not limited to: population growth and urbanization, increasing quantity/complexity of waste streams, climate change, carbon economics, resource scarcity, corporate sustainability targets, commodity prices, energy security and tightening regulations (Global Industrial Waste Water Systems Market Survey Report, December 2021).

Strategy

                Our growth strategy includes a blend of routes, including but not limited to:


1) | Organic growth
---+---------------
 | ● | New market penetration and expansion of customer base with suite of current products
 | ● | Expansion of customer base by product diversification 
2) | | Inorganic growth 
 | ● | M&A 
 | ● | Strategic Partnerships

Organic Growth

                The Company’s growth over the next two years will be predominantly driven by sales of current systems in the identified key markets, leading to customer base expansion, with the municipal market expected to generate a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. The initial geographical focus will be North America and Canada, the UK, and EMEA. Our business model includes direct sales to end-users and indirect sales via channel partners. In some markets revenue will be generated from a mix of capital equipment sales and a Waste Purchase Agreement (WPA) which is a paid service for waste treatment. The latter will be offered through a financing arm which will be established within 2022 and target direct end-user engagement. The financing systems to be sold via service agreements will lower barriers to entry in our key markets and facilitate more rapid expansion of our client base. Examples of models to be used can include, but are not limited to: Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT), depending on clients’ preferences and limitations. We envisage that in some cases public private partnerships (PPPs) will be established, particularly when selling to public utilities, and addressing projects in developing geographies. 

In addition, we are planning during the next two to three years to conduct further product development and expand our product portfolio that will facilitate entrance into new subsegments where particularly high strength waste streams require treatment. This is most relevant to some industrial manufacturing, defense, and waste management applications. Our intention is to maintain a healthy R&D budget to attain this goal.

Inorganic Growth

                Strategic partnerships will form an ongoing key growth strategy. Strategic partners being considered that we are currently engaging with include: 


(1) | Technology companies offering complimentary technologies that can enhance our product offering by creating strong synergies. In particular we are exploring technologies that are able to recycle our end-products to achieve more efficient resource recovery (which has both environmental and cost impacts). This will help accelerate our growth by gaining access to existing client bases. We are currently discussing options with a waste management Company based in the EU. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) offering “bolt-on” technologies that are standard ancillary equipment required in some cases for integration of our systems into a wider treatment train. 
(3) | Technology integrators, engineering consultancies, Engineering-Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies that design and install complete solution packages in which our technology will be a key component. These companies will serve as highly effective distribution channels to accelerate deployment within their existing client base, thereby facilitating our growth agenda. 
(4) | Equipment manufacturers with adequate facilities to accelerate production, meet deployment lead times, and also attain economies of scale. We have a partnership in place with Merrell Bros., Inc., a US biosolids management Company that operates on a nationwide scale, and with Environmental Services Company Ltd. (ESC), an Israeli government-owned company that is charged with treating industrial waste in Israel. We are in the process of locating another strategic partner in the EU. Our manufacturing agreements are structured so we are able to maintain a healthy working capital that can be reinvested in other company functions for supporting our immediate aggressive growth agenda.


                A mid-term growth strategy, includes licensing agreements and M&As of Small Business Enterprises (SBEs) to increase functionality of our systems (such as implementation of IOT platforms for full process digitization) and to increase supply chain reliability and efficiency for ancillary process equipment that is required for full integration of systems (i.e., pumps, valves, filters, dewatering equipment etc.). 

Products and Services

                We sell AirSCWO™ as a modular and containerized system. These are compact and prefabricated so they can be cost effectively shipped, installed, and operated within the footprint of an existing plant.  We are currently offering a six (6) wet tons per day throughput capacity system and a thirty (30) wet tons per day throughput capacity system in 2023. A two hundred (200) wet tons per day throughput capacity system is to be designed between FY 2024 and 2025.

                In some cases, on an as-needed basis, we will sell, as part of the solution package, ancillary equipment that is required to pre-treat the inlet waste stream and post-treat a product stream, depending on the application. For example, to meet the AirSCWOTM inlet requirements (i.e., water %, total dissolved solids, etc.) sometimes a pre-treatment “bolt-on” process is implemented to ensure our system performance. 

                We offer two purchase options as follows:


1. | Capital equipment purchase 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | | a. | Immediate payment in which the client owns the system outright. 
 | | b. | Leasing a system for a specified period of time and then purchasing at residual value at the end of the lease term.
2. | Waste Purchase Agreements (WPAs) in which the client pays a fee for having their waste treated. Examples of these agreements can include but are not limited to: Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) or Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT). In a BOT model we are responsible for designing, building, operating (during the contracted period), and transferring to the client at the end of the contract term. The client will pay us a service fee for operating and maintaining the system (this does not include installation and commissioning fees). A BOOT model is a variation of the BOT model, except that the ownership of the system will rest with us during the period of the contract, and the client is contracted to purchase the system on mutually agreed terms at the end of the defined term, after we recover our investment and reasonable return as per the contract.


In addition, the Company will offer after sales agreements for supply of parts, maintenance and repairs.

Technology and Intellectual Property

We have designed an offensive intellectual property strategy to ensure we maintain a competitive edge in this space. We currently have filed five (5) provisional patents that cover crucial process operational aspects and improve system efficiencies and performance, including a provisional patent to cover a next-generation AirSCWOTM system for high strength waste stream treatment. We are allocating R&D resources to support data generation that will allow moving to full non-provisional patent application by November 2022, with the intention of filing a PCT application.
Collaborations

                We have an exclusive manufacturing agreement in place with Merrell Bros Inc., which is based in Kokomo, Indiana, and is a nationwide biosolids management company helping municipalities, industries and agricultural operations successfully manage and recycle biosolids. They also serve as a channel partner to facilitate our market penetration and expansion plans in the US by opening up their existing client base.

                We have a Sponsored Partnership Agreement with Duke University that provides access to Duke’s world-class research capabilities, building on our own R&D expertise and strengthening our core development activities when needed.

                We have an exclusive partnership agreement with Environmental Services Company Ltd., who is based in Israel, to act as our channel partner for treating hazardous waste streams in Israel. 

Marketing

                Our approach is through information, education, and thought leadership. This is because business purchase decisions are based more on bottom-line revenue impact. Return on investment (ROI) is a primary focus for corporate decision makers. 

                We perform a business-to-business style of marketing of our products and services. We conduct marketing campaigns are aimed at any individual(s) with control or influence on purchasing decisions. This can encompass a wide variety of titles and functions, from entry-level end-users all the way up to the C-suite.

Government Regulations

Our operations and AirSCWO units may be subject to various United States federal, state and local and, in the case of our Israel operations, Israeli laws and regulations and requirements governing the protection of the environment, public health and safety, and other matters. For example, the construction and operation of our AirSCWO units may require obtaining air permits from various states or, alternatively, obtaining a formal determination from a state that a permit is not required. We may also be required to obtain state and local treatment works approval to install our AirSCWO units if a unit is connected to a system which is permitted pursuant to the United States National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems Act. In the event our AirSCWO units are used to treat metals, the resulting mineral stream may constitute heavy meals under the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) and require separation and regulated disposal if such heavy metals were deemed to be hazardous waste under the RCRA. If the operators of our AirSCWO units are treating hazardous waste, they may be required to obtain special hazardous waste technician training. Additionally, we are currently evaluating whether our AirSCWO units may be regulated pursuant to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act and thereby be subject to inspections thereunder. We intend that our operations and AirSCWO units will be in material compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable laws and regulations. 
Where You Can Find Additional Information

The Company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. The Company files with, or furnishes to, the SEC quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports and will furnish its proxy statement. These filings are available free of charge on the Company’s website, www.374water.com shortly after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Emerging Growth Company

We are also an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” As long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not an “emerging growth company,” like those applicable to a “smaller reporting company,” including, but not limited to, a scaled down description of our business in SEC filings; no requirements to include risk factors in Exchange Act filings; no requirement to include certain selected financial data and supplementary financial information in SEC filings; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the Exchange Act; no requirement for Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are also only required to file audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial statements of any applicable subsequent quarter.

We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We can remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years. We would cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more and when we become a “larger accelerated filer,” have a public float of $700 million or more or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

Sarbanes/Oxley Act

Except for the limitations excluded by the JOBS Act discussed under the preceding heading “Emerging Growth Company,” we are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes/Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.
