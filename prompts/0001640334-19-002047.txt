Business Development

Almost Never Films Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated in Nevada in October 2007 as Smack Sportswear (“Smack”), which originally manufactured and sold performance and lifestyle based indoor and sand volleyball apparel and accessories. The Company is now an independent film company focused on film production and production related services in connection with genre specific motion pictures with production costs in the $5.0 million to $50.0 million range. 

On January 15, 2016, pursuant to the share exchange agreement, among Almost Never Films Inc. f/k/a Smack Sportswear (the “Company”, “we,” “our” or “us”), Almost Never Films Inc. (“ANF”), an Indiana corporation, and the two shareholders of ANF (the “ANF Shareholders”), we issued to the ANF Shareholders, 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), par value $0.001 per share in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of the issued and outstanding common stock of ANF (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, ANF became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and our business has become the business of ANF, effective on January 15, 2016.

The share exchange was accounted for as a "reverse acquisition," and resulted in a recapitalization. Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $6,566 and $598,869, respectively. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the share exchange will be those of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and the combined financial statements after completion of the share exchange include the assets and liabilities of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), historical operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), and operations of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana) from the closing date of the share exchange. As a result of the issuance of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the share exchange, a change in control of the Company occurred as of the date of consummation of the share exchange. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization. The Company has not yet generated any revenue since the reverse acquisition. 

On February 29, 2016, the stockholders of Smack voted to amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to (i) increase the authorized capital of the Company to 200,000,00 shares of common stock and (ii) to change the name of the Company to “Almost Never Films Inc.” which took effect on March 2, 2017. 

The Company has 5,000,000 authorized preferred shares with no par value.

Smack issued 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to the Mr. Chan and Mr. Williams in exchange for all 100,000,000 shares of issued and outstanding common stock of Almost Never Films Inc. (Indiana), with a value of $10,000.

On March 4, 2016, all 1,000,000 preferred shares were converted into 100,000,000 common shares.

There were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2019.

On March 8, 2016, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with a shareholder. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and said shareholder purchased, an aggregate of 49,720,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of $0.005 per share in exchange for the cancellation of and discharge of certain promissory notes issued by the Company and payable to said shareholder. The foregoing issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as not involving any public offering and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws.

In March through November 2016, the Company entered into four share purchase agreements with four investors for 12,500,000 common shares at $0.02 per share for total proceeds of $250,000.

On November 16, 2016, the company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “KBM Agreement”) with Konwiser Brothers Media (“KBM”, and together with ANF, the “Parties). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Parties will create an LLC or other entity (the “Company”), for the purpose of developing, producing and exploiting proposed motion picture project currently entitled “Field Trip” (the “Picture”). KBM will contribute its development and producing services to the Company and all rights to the Screenplay, and ANF will make financial contributions, assist in the raising of additional financing and participate in the development and production process as set forth more fully herein. The Company will own 100% of the copyright to the Picture and all other ancillary and related rights, and each of KBM and ANF will own an undivided 50% interest in the Company. KBM will be the managing member of the Company. The operating agreement for the Company will be consistent with the terms of this Agreement. This transaction, and the ones mentioned below, removed the Company from its prior shell status. On September 27, 2017, KBM informed the Company of its intent to terminate the KBM Agreement.

On December 1, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1, registering 10,000,000 shares for certain selling shareholders. The Form S-1 was declared effective on December 9, 2016.

On February 29, 2016, the stockholders of Smack voted to amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to (i) increase the authorized capital of the Company to 200,000,00 shares of common stock and (ii) to change the name of the Company to “Almost Never Films Inc.” which took effect on March 2, 2017. 

On September 13, 2017, the Company completed a 1 for 40 reverse stock split and changed the authorized capital of the Company to 25,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share.

We continue to be a "smaller reporting company," as defined under the Exchange Act, following the Share Exchange.

History

As described above, we were incorporated in Nevada in October 2007 under the name SMACK Sportswear under which we manufactured and sold performance and lifestyle based indoor and sand volleyball apparel and accessories. As a result of the sale of certain inventory from the Company to Mr. Sigler in July 2015, the Company became a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Share Exchange, we acquired the proposed business of Almost Never.

Almost Never, our wholly-owned subsidiary upon the closing of Share Exchange, was incorporated in the State of Indiana on July 8, 2015. As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from “Smack Sportswear” to “Almost Never Films Inc.” to more accurately reflect its new business. We also requested a change to the Company’s trading symbol to "HLWD" 

We currently have authorized 30,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares designated as preferred stock containing such rights, privileges and designations as our Board of directors may, from time to time, determine. As of the date of this Report, an aggregate of 5,798,765 shares of our Common Stock and no shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding.

On March 4, 2017, all previously authorized 1,000,000 preferred shares were converted into 2,500,000 common shares. In March through November 2017, the Company entered into four share purchase agreements with three investors for 312,500 common shares at $0.08 per share for total proceeds of $250,000 

On March 8, 2017, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with a shareholder. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company sold, and said shareholder purchased, an aggregate of 1,243,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price of $0.005 per share in exchange for the cancellation of and discharge of certain promissory notes issued by the Company and payable to said shareholder. The foregoing issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as not involving any public offering and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws.

On September 13, 2017, the Company completed a 1 for 40 reverse stock split and changed the authorized capital of the Company to 25,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share.

Our principal executive office is located at 8605 Santa Monica Blvd #98258, West Hollywood, California 90069-4109.

Our Business

We are an independent film company focused on film production and production related services in connection with genre specific motion pictures with production costs in the $5.0 million to $50.0 million range.

Our proposed business is to facilitate relationships (and as such, provide production related services) between creative talent (including writers, actors and directors) and companies who produce, finance and distribute motion pictures. We intend to acquire or license rights to materials upon which we believe motion pictures can be based (screenplays, books, short stories etcetera, which are referred to within the entertainment industry as the “underlying property”). We may further develop an underlying property by contracting for additional writing services and/or by bringing in new writers to perform “polishes” or “rewrites” on a particular underlying property.

If we are satisfied with the creative state of the underlying property, we then intend to make offers to directors and/or actors, to perform services in connection with a particular motion picture based on that underlying property. These offers are very often contingent and subject to the satisfaction of certain production elements, such as financier approval of the screenplay and the financier’s selection of a start date for principal photography. 

If a director or actors accepts one of our offers, the director or actors are said to be “attached” to the motion picture project. Armed with the underlying property and the attached creative element(s) (these elements are often called the “package” in Hollywood), we may then approach third party financiers seeking financing as well as distribution for the potential motion picture. Another approach that we may take is to contact the financiers first, seeking first to produce the film, and then with a finished (or nearly finished) motion picture product, obtain distribution for the picture.

Motion Picture Property Acquisition Process

Our acquisition process is the process by which we intend to acquire or license “underlying properties”. In turn, we expect to use those properties to attract creative talent (including writers, actors and directors) to the potential motion picture project. If successful, we will then grant or license out those rights to third party financiers of motion pictures, who will then contract with the creative talent we have attracted to the property as well as finance, produce and distribute/exploit the motion picture. 
Almost Never Feature Film Production

Our initial primary involvement with feature film production is in the area of the development of “underlying properties”. We intend to engage third parties to produce, finance and exploit/distribute the motion picture “packages” we put together. We may also provide production expertise (i.e. “production services”) to the third-party producer and/or financier of the motion picture in question. If we do provide production expertise, we, or members of our executive team, Danny Chan and Daniel Roth, may be credited as “producers” or “executive producers” of the particular film in question. We expect to primarily derive our income from producer fees, consulting and service fees as well as our participation in the profits of the various pictures produced by third parties, that were developed and/or “packaged” by us.

Our feature film strategy generally is to perform production services, develop and/or produce feature films when the production budgets for the films are expected to be entirely or substantially covered by a third party. In this way, we believe our risk is, by in large, only the capital required, if any, to develop and package the motion picture project. The entirety of the production budget, as well as any costs associated with distributing and/or exploiting the motion pictures in question, will be expected to be borne by a third party or parties who have the resources and expertise to produce and/or distribute motion pictures.

Distributing Almost Never Motion Pictures

Currently, we do not intend to directly distribute motion pictures. Instead, when we seek financing for our motion picture “packages,” the distribution rights are often obtained by the financier as collateral for their investment; in other words, third parties purchase the world-wide exploitation and distribution rights to a motion picture for the cost it takes to produce the motion picture.
Foreign Markets

In general, a very important portion of the financing for “independent” (i.e., not produced by a major studio or one of their subsidiaries) motion pictures comes from the “foreign markets” (i.e., those markets outside of the United States and English-speaking Canada). With respect to productions we are associated with, the third-party financier owns and/or controls the production rights and uses these rights as collateral or purchases the rights outright in connection with the funding of the pictures we develop.
Profit Participation

Our profit participation in motion picture projects will be determined by a calculation that assumes that all “negative costs” (production costs) of the picture (including, but not limited to, costs for development, principal photography and post-production) and “distribution expenses” (including, but not limited to, costs for marketing the film at various international film markets as well as costs associated with the delivery of the film and the physical elements to the various licensees of the film) are recovered by the financier plus interest thereon. After repayment of all negative costs, distribution expenses and interest thereon, the financier/distributor will charge a “distribution fee” (often a percentage of the gross income) for performing any sales or distribution services in connection with the picture. Following the payment of distribution fees and other costs, any amounts payable to creative elements that are contingent compensation (including, but not limited to, deferred compensation and bonuses) are paid to those third parties. Any money remaining is considered net profits from which profit participation is derived.

Competition

The motion picture industry is intensely competitive. In addition to competing with the major film studios that dominate the motion picture industry, we will also compete with numerous independent motion picture production companies, television networks, pay television systems, and online streaming media companies such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Virtually all of our competitors who are significantly larger than we are have been in business much longer than we have, and have significantly more resources at their disposal. Our competitors range from small independent producers to well financed established film studios, particularly, major U.S. film studios.
Intellectual Property

We believe that intellectual property will be material to our business and we will expend cost and effort in an attempt to develop and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties' intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks. Enforcement of intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.

From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot offer any assurances that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute.

Industry Background

The Feature Film Industry. The feature film industry encompasses the development, production and exhibition of feature-length motion pictures and their subsequent distribution in the online, DVD, television, video on demand and other ancillary markets. The major studios dominate the industry, some of which have divisions that are promoted as "independent" distributors of motion pictures, including Universal Pictures, Warner Bros Entertainment (also known as Warner Bros. Studios, Inc., Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. commonly called Warner Bros., or simply WB) including subsidiaries New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment & DC Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox, Sony Pictures Entertainment (including Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures), Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, MGM Holdings and Lions Gate Entertainment. In recent years, however, true "independent" motion picture production and distribution companies have played an important role in the production of motion pictures for the worldwide feature film market.
Independent Feature Film Production and Financing. Generally, independent production companies do not have access to the extensive capital required to make big budget motion pictures, such as the "blockbuster" product produced by the major studios. They also do not have the capital necessary to maintain the substantial overhead that is typical of such studios' operations. Independent producers target their product at specialized markets and usually produce motion pictures with budgets of less than $25 million. Generally, independent producers do not maintain significant infrastructure. They instead hire only creative and other production personnel and retain the other elements required for development, pre-production, principal photography and post-production activities on a project-by-project basis. Also, independent production companies typically finance their production activities from bank loans, pre-sales, equity offerings, co-productions and joint ventures rather than out of operating cash flow. They generally complete financing of an independent motion picture prior to commencement of principal photography to minimize risk of loss.
Independent Feature Film Distribution. Motion picture distribution encompasses the exploitation of motion pictures in theatres and in markets, such as the DVD, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and ancillary markets, such as hotels, airlines and streaming films on the Internet. Independent producers do not typically have distribution capabilities and rely instead on pre-sales to North American and international distributors. Generally, the local distributor will acquire distribution rights for a motion picture in one or more of the aforementioned distribution channels from an independent producer. The local distributor will agree to advance the producer a non-refundable minimum guarantee. The local distributor will then generally receive a distribution fee of between 20% and 35% of receipts, while the producer will receive a portion of gross receipts in excess of the distribution fees, distribution expenses and monies retained by exhibitors. The local distributor and theatrical exhibitor generally will enter into an arrangement providing for the exhibitor's payment to the distributor of a percentage (generally 40% to 50%) of the box-office receipts for the exhibition period, depending upon the success of the motion picture.
Government Regulation
The Company is not currently subject to any direct government regulations, other than the securities laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to all publicly owned companies and laws and regulations applicable to general businesses. It is possible that certain laws and regulations may be adopted at the local, state, national and international level that could affect the Company's operations. Changes to such laws could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for the Company's products or increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or a variety of other such costs, or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If any such law or regulation is adopted it could limit the Company's ability to operate and could force the business operations to cease, which would have a significantly negative effect on the Company.
