Introduction 
 We are a global diversified industrial company that combines advanced engineering and production capabilities with in-depth materials science expertise to design and manufacture high-precision solutions, components and assemblies for the medical, aerospace and defense, electrical, automotive and general industrial markets. We have 44 facilities in North America, Europe, South America and China. 
 On August 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our global precision bearing components business (the PBC Business) to TSUBAKI NAKASHIMA Co., Ltd. for approximately $388.5 million. We intend to reinvest the after-tax proceeds of the sale of the PBC Business with acquisitions and strategic investments in our highest-growth and highest-margin end market, medical, and to a lesser extent our aerospace and defense, electrical, automotive, and general industrial end markets. 
 In January 2018, we implemented a new enterprise and management structure designed to accelerate growth and further balance our portfolio by aligning our strategic assets and businesses. Our businesses were reorganized into the Mobile Solutions, Power Solutions and Life Sciences divisions and are based principally on the end markets they serve. The Life Sciences division is focused on growth in the medical end market. The Power Solutions division is focused on growth in the electrical and aerospace and defense end markets. The Mobile Solutions division is focused on growth in the industrial and automotive end markets. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we will report our financial results based on these new segments. However, for purposes of this annual report we have presented our business as it was conducted during the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 Our business as conducted in 2017, products and recent acquisition activity are described further below. 
 Acquisition Activity 
 On October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of DRT Medical, LLC, which was subsequently named NN Life Sciences  Vandalia, LLC (Vandalia), a supplier of precision manufactured medical instruments and orthopedic implants, from DRT Holdings, Inc. (DRT Holdings). Vandalia is a supplier of precision manufactured medical instruments and orthopedic implants with locations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 On October 19, 2015, we completed the acquisition (the PEP Acquisition) of Precision Engineered Products Holdings, Inc. (PEP). As a result of the PEP Acquisition, PEP became a wholly owned subsidiary of NN. PEP is a global manufacturer of highly engineered precision customized solutions serving the medical, electrical, automotive, general industrial and aerospace and defense end markets. PEP combines materials science expertise with advanced engineering and production capabilities to design and manufacture a broad range of high-precision metal and plastic components, assemblies and finished devices. Following the PEP Acquisition, we combined the operations of PEP with our Plastics and Rubber Components Group and renamed the group as the Precision Engineered Products Group.

On May 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Caprock Manufacturing, Inc. and Caprock Enclosures, LLC (collectively referred to as Caprock). Caprock was a privately held plastic components supplier located in Lubbock, Texas. Caprock serves multiple end markets; including aerospace and defense, medical and life sciences and general industrial. The acquisition provided further balancing of our end markets and represented the first step in our strategic plan related to transforming our plastics business. The results of Caprock have been consolidated with NN since the date of acquisition as part of the Precision Engineered Products Group. 
 Business Segments and Products 
 Autocam Precision Components Group 
 Within our Autocam Precision Components Group, we manufacture highly engineered, difficult-to-manufacture precision metal components and subassemblies for the automotive and general industrial end markets. Our entry into the precision metal components market began in 2006 with the acquisition of Whirlaway Corporation. We dramatically expanded the segment in 2014 with the acquisitions of Autocam and V-S Industries. These acquisitions furthered our strategy to diversify our end markets and build upon our core manufacturing competency of high-precision metal machining. 
 We sell a wide range of highly engineered, extremely close tolerance, precision-machined metal components and subassemblies primarily to the automotive and general industrial end markets. We have developed an expertise in manufacturing highly complex, system critical components for fuel systems, engines and transmissions, power steering systems and electromechanical motors on a high-volume basis. This expertise has been gained through investment in technical capabilities, processes and systems, and skilled program management and product launch capabilities. 
 Precision Engineered Products Group 
 Within our Precision Engineered Products Group, we combine materials science expertise with advanced engineering and production capabilities to design and manufacture a broad range of high-precision metal and plastic components, assemblies and finished devices for the medical and life sciences, electrical, automotive, general industrial and aerospace and defense end markets. 
 We manufacture a variety of components, assemblies and instruments, such as surgical knives, bio-resorbable implants, surgical staples, orthopedic system tools, laparoscopic devices, drug delivery devices and catheter components for the medical and life sciences end market; electrical contacts, connectors, contact assemblies and precision stampings for the electrical end market; precision components, assemblies and electrical contacts and precision plastic components for the automotive and general industrial end markets; and a variety of engineered materials for the aerospace and defense end markets, including optical grade plastics, thermally conductive plastics, and titanium, Inconel, magnesium and gold electroplating. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 High-precision manufacturing capabilities 
 We believe our ability to produce high-precision parts at high production volumes is among the best in the market. Our technology platform consists of high precision machining, progressive stamping, injection molding, laser welding, material science, assembly and design optimization. Unique specialty machine building capabilities, in-house tool design and process know-how create trade secrets that enable consistent production tolerances of less than one micron while producing millions of parts per day. Parts are manufactured to application-specific, customer design and co-design standards that are developed for a specific use. The high-precision capabilities are part of our zero-defect design process, which seeks to eliminate variability and manufacturing defects throughout the entire product lifecycle. We believe our production capabilities provide a competitive advantage as few other manufacturers are capable of meeting tolerance demands at any level requested by our customers. As the need for tight-tolerance precision parts, subassemblies, and devices continue to increase, we believe that our production capabilities will place us at the forefront of the industry. We have differentiated ourselves among our competitors by providing customers engineered solutions and a broad reach and breadth of manufacturing capabilities. We believe it is for these reasons, and because of our proven ability to produce high-quality, precision parts and components on a cost-effective basis, that customers choose us to meet their manufacturing needs. 
 Differentiated, system-critical products 
 The tight-tolerance and high-quality nature of our precision products are specifically suited for use in the most demanding applications that require superior reliability. Our products are critical components to the operation and reliability of larger mechanical systems. Precision parts are difficult to manufacture and achieve premium pricing in the marketplace as the high cost of failure motivates our customers to focus on quality. Our products are developed for specific uses within critical systems and are typically designed in conjunction with the system designer. Our parts are often qualified for, or specified in, customer designs, reducing the ability for customers to change suppliers.

Our ability to make products with tight-tolerance and extreme precision requirements enables our customers to satisfy the critical functionality and performance requirements of their products. We are included in customer designs and deployed in critical systems that involve high cost of failure applications and significant regulatory certification processes, including those for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), UL and the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (NADCAP). 
 Complete product lifecycle focus 
 Our engineering expertise and deep knowledge of precision manufacturing processes adds proprietary value throughout the complete lifecycle of our products. Our in-house engineering team works closely with our customers to provide parts that meet specific design specifications for a given application. The relationship with the customer begins early in the conceptual design process when we provide feedback on potential cost, manufacturability and estimated reliability of metal parts. Part designs are then prototyped, tested and qualified in coordination with the customer design process before going to full-scale production. The close working relationship with our customers early in the product lifecycle helps to secure business, increase industry knowledge and develop significant trade secrets. Performance verification, product troubleshooting and post-production engineering services further deepen relationships with our customers as well as provide additional industry knowledge that is applicable to future design programs and provide continuous manufacturing process improvement. 
 Prototype products are developed for testing and process validation procedures are instituted. In many instances, we will file for regulatory production approval and include the customers proprietary processes, further discouraging supplier changes. We will assist the customer with continuous supply chain management, comprehensive customer support for the lifetime of the product and continuously seek to identify new operational efficiencies to reduce the products cost and improve its quality. Once our solution is designed into a platform, it is often embedded through the multi-year manufacturing lifecycle and has a competitive advantage in supporting subsequent platforms. As an added benefit, customers generally fund development, prototypes and manufacturing tooling expenses. This discourages supplier changes and drives recurring revenue for the company. 
 Long-term blue-chip customer base 
 We maintain relationships with hundreds of customers around the world. Our customers are typically sophisticated, engineering-driven, mechanical systems manufacturers with long histories of product development and reputations for quality. We have no significant retail exposure, which limits volatility and provides enhanced sales visibility. Relationships with our top ten customers, in terms of revenue, average more than ten years. We have significant exposure to emerging markets in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe through these global customers as well as key local manufacturers. The diverse nature, size and reach of our customer base provides resistance to localized market and geographic fluctuations and help stabilizes overall product demand. 
 Strategic global footprint 
 Our 44 facilities, on four continents, are strategically located to serve our customer base and provide local service and expertise. Our global footprint provides flexibility to locally supply identical products for global customers, reducing shipping time and expense, allowing us to match costs to revenue and to capitalize on industry localization trends. In total, we operate more than 2.4 million square feet of manufacturing space in six countries. North America constitutes the largest portion of our manufacturing operations with facilities in the U.S. and Mexico. The North American facilities are strategically located to serve major customers in the United States and Mexico. Our foreign facilities are located in regional manufacturing hubs in France, Poland, China and Brazil, and primarily serve global customers in those local markets. The Asian and South American facilities, we believe, have significant growth potential as local customer bases expand and the markets for high-precision products grow in those regions. 
 Proven and experienced management team 
 We believe that we are led by one of the strongest management teams in our industry, with significant proven experience in precision manufacturing and the diversified industrial sector. Rich Holder was named Chief Executive Officer and director in 2013. Mr. Holder joined us from Eaton Corporation, where he served as President of Eaton Electrical Components Group, and brings to us a proven record of leadership, successful team building and relevant experience in both organic and acquisition growth. He has since assembled a strong management team through retention of key talent, recent acquisitions and new hires. Thomas C. Burwell, Jr., our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us since 2005, has over 25 years of service in various finance and strategic development roles. Our management team has successfully executed and integrated into our business eight acquisitions over the last four years, increasing revenue by more than 150% since 2013. We believe that our current management team has the necessary talent and experience to lead our efforts with respect to our organic and acquisition growth goals.

Research and Development and Product Engineering 
 Our research and development and product engineering efforts focus on enhancing our existing products and developing patented products, particularly in the medical industry, that can be presented to and sold by our customers. Our Precision Engineered Products Group has developed a portfolio of patented and branded medical products that we manufacture for customers and that are sold through their channel. Our Autocam Precision Products Group engineering team focuses on working closely with our customers to develop engineered solutions to improve our customers products. 
Customers 
 Our products are supplied primarily to manufacturers for use in a broad range of industrial applications, including automotive; electrical; agricultural; construction; residential devices and equipment; medical; aerospace and defense; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; fluid power and diesel engines. Sales to each of our top ten customers are made to multiple customer locations and divisions throughout the world. In 2017, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 46% of our net sales. In 2017, 78% of our products were sold to customers in North America, 6% to customers in Europe, 10% to customers in Asia and the remaining 6% to customers in South America. Excluding the PBC Business, we did not have any customer that accounted for 10% or more of total net sales. 
 We sell our products to most of our largest customers under either sales contracts or agreed upon commercial terms. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations when incurred to our customers in the form of changes in selling prices. We ordinarily ship our products directly to customers within 60 days, and in many cases, during the same calendar month of the date on which a sales order is placed. Accordingly, we generally have an insignificant amount of open (backlog) orders from customers at month end. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 A primary emphasis of our marketing strategy is to expand key customer relationships by offering high quality, high-precision, application-specific customer solutions with the value of a single supply chain partner for a wide variety of products and components. Due to the technical nature of many of our products, our engineers and manufacturing management personnel also provide technical sales support functions, while internal sales employees handle customer orders and other general sales support activities. Our marketing strategy is to offer custom manufactured, high quality, precision products to markets with high value-added characteristics at competitive price levels. This strategy focuses on relationships with key customers that require the production of technically difficult parts and assemblies, enabling us to take advantage of our strengths in custom product development, equipment and tool design, component assembly and machining processes. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed a total of 3,884 full-time employees and 523 full time equivalent temporary workers. Of our total employment, 16% are management/staff/government/statutory employees and 84% are production employees. The employees of the France, Brazil, and Brainin de Mexico plants are unionized. A small group of employees at our Bridgeport, Connecticut plant are also unionized. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and the unions that represent them. 
Competition 
 Autocam Precision Components Group 
 In the market in which our Autocam Precision Components Group operates, internal production of components by our customers can impact our business as the customers weigh the risk of outsourcing strategically critical components or producing in-house. Our primary outside competitors are Anton Häring KG, A. Berger Holding Gmbh & Co. KG, C&A Tool Engineering, Inc., American Turned Products, Inc., Camcraft, Inc., IMS Gear, and Brovedani. We generally win new business on the basis of technical competence and our proven track record of successful product development. 
Precision Engineered Products Group 
 Our Precision Engineered Products Group operates in intensely competitive but very fragmented supply chains. We must compete with numerous companies in each industry market segment. 
 Our primary competitors in the medical device market are Tecomet, Inc., Lake Region Medical, Inc. and Vention Medical, Inc. Our primary competitors in the electrical market are Deringer-Ney, Inc., Doduco GmbH and Metalor Technologies International. Our primary competitors in the automotive and aerospace and defense market are Interplex Industries, Inc. and Accu-Mold, LLC. 
 
6 
 
We believe that competition within the medical device, electrical, automotive and aerospace and defense end markets is based principally on quality, price, design capabilities and speed of responsiveness and delivery. We believe that our competitive strengths are product development, tool design, fabrication, tight tolerance processes, and customer solutions. With these strengths, we have built our reputation in the marketplace as a quality producer of technically difficult products. 
 Raw Materials 
 Autocam Precision Components Group 
 The Autocam Precision Components Group produces products from a wide variety of metals in various forms from various sources located in the North America, Europe, South America and Asia. Basic types include hot rolled steel, cold rolled steel (both carbon and alloy), stainless, extruded aluminum, die cast aluminum, gray and ductile iron castings, hot and cold forgings and mechanical tubing. Some material is purchased directly under contracts, some is consigned by the customer, and some is purchased directly from the steel mills. 
Precision Engineered Products Group 
 The Precision Engineered Products Group uses a wide variety of metals in various forms, including precious metals like gold, silver, palladium and platinum, as well as plastics. Through our diverse network of suppliers, we minimize supplier concentration risk and provide a stable supply of raw materials at competitive pricing. This group also procures resins and metal stampings from several domestic and foreign suppliers. 
 For the Precision Engineered Products Group, we base purchase decisions on quality, service and price. Generally, we do not enter into written supply contracts with our suppliers or commit to maintain minimum monthly purchases of materials. However, we carefully manage raw material price volatility, particularly with respect to precious metals, through the use of consignment agreements. In effect, we contract the precious metals for our own stock and buy the raw materials on the same day customer shipments are priced, thereby eliminating speculation. 
 In each of our segments, we have historically been affected by upward price pressure on steel principally due to general increases in global demand. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations to our customers in the form of changes in selling price. 
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
 We have several U.S. patents, patent applications and trademarks for various trade names. Furthermore, we intend to develop patented products that can be presented to and sold by our customers. However, we cannot be certain that we would be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties, and if we cannot do so, we may face increased competition and diminished net sales. 
 Furthermore, third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property, and we may have to pay substantial damages and/or redesign our products if we are ultimately found to infringe. Even if such intellectual property claims against us are without merit, investigating and defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. 
 Additionally, we rely on certain data and processes, including trade secrets and know-how, and the success of our business depends, to some extent, on such information remaining confidential. Each officer is subject to a non-competition and confidentiality agreement that seeks to protect this information. Additionally, all employees are subject to company code of ethics policies that prohibit the disclosure of information critical to the operations of our business. 
 Seasonal Nature of Business 
 General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, medical device sales are often stronger in the third and fourth calendar quarter and sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not materially impacted by seasonality. 
 
7 
 
Environmental Compliance 
 Our operations and products are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulatory requirements both domestically and abroad relating to pollution control and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, discharges to air or water, the generation, storage, handling, and use of automotive hazardous materials and the handling and disposal of hazardous waste generated at our facilities. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for all the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We maintain a compliance program to assist in preventing and, if necessary, correcting environmental problems. 
 Based on information compiled to date, management believes that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have assessed conditional asset retirement obligations and have found them to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure that currently unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not materially affect our business or operations in the future. More specifically, although we believe that we dispose of waste in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot be certain that we will not incur significant liabilities in the future in connection with the clean-up of waste disposal sites. 
 FDA Compliance 
 As a manufacturer of medical devices, certain of our subsidiaries, including PEP, are required to register as such with FDA. Each of our facilities that manufacture finished medical devices is registered with the FDA. To maintain our registration, we deploy a robust quality management system across all of our manufacturing facilities. 
 With respect to medical and life sciences products that we are specifically developing to sell to our customers, before these devices can be marketed, we will seek to obtain a marketing clearance from the FDA under Section 510(k) of the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA typically grants a 510(k) clearance if the applicant can establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Clearance under Section 510(k) typically takes about four months from the date of submission.
