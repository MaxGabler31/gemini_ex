ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

The Company
MGP is one of the leading publicly traded REITs engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts, whose tenants generally offer diverse amenities including casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail offerings. 
MGP is a limited liability company that was formed in Delaware in October 2015. MGP conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed by MGM in January 2016 and acquired by MGP on April 25, 2016 (the “IPO Date”). The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016.
MGP is organized in an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which MGP owns substantially all of its assets and conducts substantially all of its business through the Operating Partnership, which is owned by MGP and certain other subsidiaries of MGM and whose sole general partner is one of MGP’s subsidiaries. MGM holds a controlling interest in MGP through its ownership of MGP’s Class B share, but does not hold any of MGP’s Class A shares. The Class B share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from the operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP but which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares. The Class B share structure was put in place to align MGM’s voting rights in MGP with its economic interest in the Operating Partnership. As further described below, MGM will no longer be entitled to the voting rights provided by the Class B share if MGM and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP and its subsidiaries) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership falls below 30%.
MGP, through the Operating Partnership, leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM (which was branded as Monte Carlo prior to May 2018), Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage (collectively, the “IPO Properties”), as well as Borgata and MGM National Harbor, to a subsidiary of MGM.
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of eleven premier destination resorts, as well as the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, in Northfield, Ohio, which include properties that we believe are among the world's finest casino and resorts, and The Park in Las Vegas.
Business
We generate a substantial portion of our revenue by leasing our properties owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “Landlord”) to a subsidiary of MGM (the “Tenant”) pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the “Master Lease”). Our portfolio consists of premier destination resorts operated by MGM, including properties that we believe are among the world’s finest casino resorts, the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park in Northfield, Ohio, The Park in Las Vegas, and Empire City in Yonkers, New York. Our properties include six large-scale entertainment and gaming-related properties located on the Las Vegas Strip (the “Strip”): Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Park MGM, New York-New York, Luxor and Excalibur, and The Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM. Outside of Las Vegas, we also own five market-leading casino resort properties: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica, both of which are located in Mississippi, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and MGM National Harbor in Prince George's County, Maryland. We also own the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park in Northfield, Ohio and Empire City in Yonkers, New York. In the future, we plan to explore opportunities to expand by acquiring similar properties as well as strategically targeting a broader universe of real estate assets within the entertainment, hospitality and leisure industries.
Northfield Transaction
On July 6, 2018, one of our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) completed the acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owns the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park (the “Northfield Acquisition”) for approximately $1.1 billion. We funded the acquisition through a $200 million draw on the term loan A facility and a $655 million draw under the revolving credit facility, with the remainder of the purchase price paid with cash on hand. Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, we entered into a new agreement with an affiliate of Hard Rock Café International (STP), Inc. (“Hard Rock”) to continue to serve as the manager of the property.
On September 18, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of Northfield (“Northfield OpCo”) to a subsidiary of MGM for approximately $275 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The TRS will concurrently liquidate and the 
1

real estate assets of Northfield will be transferred to the Landlord. Northfield will be added to the existing Master Lease between the Landlord and Tenant. As a result, the annual rent payment will increase by $60 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. Refer to Note 3 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information.
Empire City Transaction
Subsequent to year end, on January 29, 2019, we acquired the real property associated with the Empire City Casino's race track and casino (“Empire City”) from MGM, upon its acquisition of Empire City, for fair value of consideration transferred of approximately $634 million, which included the assumption of approximately $246 million of debt by the Operating Partnership with the balance through the issuance of 12.9 million Operating Partnership units to MGM. Empire City was added to the existing Master Lease between the Landlord and Tenant. As a result, the annual rent payment increased by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Refer to Note 1 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information.
Park MGM Lease Transaction 
On December 20, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement whereby the Company will pay MGM consideration of $637.5 million for renovations undertaken by MGM regarding the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). Additionally, at closing the parties will enter into an amendment to the Master Lease whereby the annual rent payment to the Company will increase by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Refer to Note 1 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information.
Overview of MGM 
The Tenant is a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM, and MGM guarantees the Tenant’s performance and payments under the Master Lease. MGM formed MGP in order to optimize MGM’s real estate holdings and establish a growth-oriented public real estate entity that will benefit from its relationship with MGM and is expected to generate reliable and growing quarterly cash distributions on a tax-efficient basis. MGM is a premier operator of a portfolio of well-known destination resort brands.
MGM has significant holdings in gaming, hospitality and entertainment with current ownership or operating interests in a high quality portfolio of casino resorts with approximately 49,000 hotel rooms, 31,500 slot machines and 2,000 table games on a combined basis as of December 31, 2018, which in addition to MGP's properties include Bellagio, MGM Grand, MGM Springfield and MGM’s unconsolidated affiliates. MGM also owns an approximate 56% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited, a publicly traded company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which owns the MGM Macau resort and casino and MGM Cotai, which opened in February 2018. 
Overview of the Master Lease 
The Master Lease has an initial lease term of ten years beginning on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National Harbor, as described below) with the potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the Tenant. The Master Lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the properties under the Master Lease at the time of the extension. The Master Lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Tenant to pay substantially all costs associated with each property, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the rent, ensuring that the cash flows associated with our Master Lease will remain relatively predictable for the duration of its term. Additionally, the Master Lease provides us with a right of first offer with respect to MGM Springfield, which we may exercise should MGM elect to sell the property in the future, and with respect to any future gaming development by MGM on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City. 
On August 1, 2016, the real estate assets of Borgata were acquired from MGM and added to the existing Master Lease between the Landlord and the Tenant (the “Borgata Transaction”). As a result, the initial annual rent amount under the Master Lease increased by $100 million to $650 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata Transaction.
On October 5, 2017, the real estate assets of MGM National Harbor were acquired from MGM and added to the existing Master Lease between the Landlord and the Tenant. As a result, the annual rent amount under the Master Lease increased to $756.7 million, prorated for the remainder of the 2017 lease year. In connection with this transaction, the Master Lease was amended to provide that the initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on August 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial term of the Master Lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the Tenant for an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the Master Lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether MGM elects to renew the other properties under the Master Lease in connection with the expiration of the initial ten-year term). If, however, the Tenant chooses not to renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the Master Lease, the Tenant would also 
2

lose the right to renew the Master Lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial ten-year lease term ends related to the rest of the properties in 2026. 
In April 2018, the second fixed annual rent escalator of 2% went into effect and the Base Rent increased to $695.8 million and the Percentage Rent remained at $74.5 million.
Rent under the Master Lease consists of a “base rent” component (the “Base Rent”) and a “percentage rent” component (the “Percentage Rent”). The Base Rent represents approximately 90% of the annual rent amount under the Master Lease and the Percentage Rent represents approximately 10% of the annual rent amount under the Master Lease. The Base Rent includes a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0% for the second through the sixth lease years (as defined in the Master Lease). Thereafter, the annual escalator of 2.0% will be subject to the Tenant and, without duplication, the MGM operating subsidiary sublessees of our Tenant (such sublessees, collectively, the “Operating Subtenants”), collectively meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio of 6.25:1.00 based on their adjusted net revenue from the leased properties subject to the Master Lease (excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Tenant’s option, certain reimbursed costs). The Percentage Rent is a fixed amount for approximately the first six lease years and will then be adjusted every five years based on the average annual adjusted net revenues of our Tenant and, without duplication, the Operating Subtenants from the leased properties subject to the Master Lease at such time for the trailing five-calendar-year period (calculated by multiplying the average annual adjusted net revenues, excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Tenant’s option, certain reimbursed costs for the trailing five-calendar-year period by 1.4%). The Master Lease includes covenants that impose ongoing reporting obligations on the Tenant relating to MGM’s financial statements which, in conjunction with MGM’s public disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) gives us insight into MGM’s financial condition on an ongoing basis. The Master Lease also requires MGM, on a consolidated basis with the Tenant, to maintain an EBITDAR to rent ratio (as described in the Master Lease) of 1.10:1.00.
Overview of Management and Governance
We have a dedicated, experienced management team with extensive experience in the real estate and gaming, lodging and leisure industries. This leadership team is bolstered by a board of directors that includes independent directors.
Our operating agreement provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between MGM or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by our board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to the Company if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of independent directors (which we refer to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange’s listing standards, the standards established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to the Company or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by MGM and its affiliates); provided, however, that our operating agreement provides that any transaction, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between MGM or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by MGM and its affiliates).

Competition
We compete with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, lenders, gaming companies and other investors. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.”

Environmental Regulations and Potential Liabilities
Government Regulation Relating to the Environment. Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment are applicable to our properties, and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us.
Costs related to environmental compliance. As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. We are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to have a material impact on the operations of any of our properties.
In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. 
Pursuant to the Master Lease, any liability arising from or relating to environmental liabilities arising from the businesses and operations located at MGM's real property holdings prior to our initial public offering is retained by the Tenant and the Tenant has indemnified us (and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and agents and certain other related parties) against any losses arising from or relating to such environmental liabilities. There can be no assurance that the Tenant will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations, or that MGM will be able to fully satisfy its obligations pursuant to its guarantee. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in receiving from the Tenant or MGM any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from the Tenant or MGM.
Regulation
The ownership, operation, and management of gaming facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on gaming industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. In addition, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:

• | ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;


• | establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;


• | establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;


• | maintain systems for reliable record keeping;


• | file periodic reports with gaming regulators;


• | ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions; and


• | establish programs to promote responsible gaming.

These regulations impact our business in three important ways: (1) our ownership and operation of the TRS; (2) our ownership of land and buildings in which gaming activities are operated by third party tenants pursuant to long-term leases; and (3) the operations of our gaming tenants. Our ownership and operation of the TRS subjects MGP, its subsidiaries and their officers, directors and limited liability company managers to the jurisdiction of the Ohio State Racing Commission and the Ohio Lottery Commission. Additionally, many gaming and racing regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which our gaming tenants operate require MGP and its affiliates to maintain a license as a principal entity, entity qualifier or supplier because of its status as landlord, including Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York and Ohio.
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, 
5

new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
Intellectual Property
We have a royalty-free intellectual property rights license agreement (the “IP License Agreement”) with MGM pursuant to which we will have the right to use “MGM” in the corporate names of our company and our subsidiaries without royalties for up to 50 years. Pursuant to the IP License Agreement, we will also have the right to use the “MGM” mark and the “MGM” logo in our advertising materials without royalties for up to 50 years. We are reliant on MGM to maintain and protect its intellectual property rights and we could be adversely impacted by infringement, invalidation, unauthorized use or litigation affecting the licensed intellectual property or brand names used in the operation of the properties.
Corporate Information
MGP is a limited liability company that was formed in Delaware in October 2015. MGP elected on its 2016 U.S. federal income tax return for its taxable year ended December 31, 2016 to be taxed as a REIT and intends to continue to qualify to do so. The Operating Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed in January 2016. Our principal offices are located at 1980 Festival Plaza Drive, Suite 750, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135 and our main telephone number is (702) 669-1480.
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources and the amount and frequency of future distributions contain forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “likely,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “projects,” “estimates” or “anticipates” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding the timing and amount of any future dividends and our ability to further grow our portfolio.
Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

• | We are dependent on MGM (including its subsidiaries) unless and until we substantially diversify our portfolio, and an event that has a material adverse effect on MGM’s business, financial position or results of operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.


• | We depend on our properties leased to MGM for substantially all of our anticipated cash flows.


• | We may not be able to re-lease our properties following the expiration or termination of the Master Lease.


• | MGP's sole material assets are Operating Partnership units representing 26.7% of the ownership interests in the Operating Partnership, as of December 31, 2018, over which we have operating control through our ownership of its general partner, and our ownership interest in the general partner of the Operating Partnership.


• | The Master Lease restricts our ability to sell our properties subject thereto.


• | We will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.


• | Covenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.


• | Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions and distributions.


• | We are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.


• | Because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified.


• | Our pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties (including our acquisition of Northfield, the real property associated with Empire City, our rights of first offer with respect to MGM Springfield and with respect to any future gaming developments by MGM on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City) may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.


• | We may face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, and our operating agreement provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption.

6


• | Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit future leases or transfers of our gaming properties, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties.


• | Net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time, which could negatively impact our income and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to shareholders.


• | Our dividend yield could be reduced if we were to sell any of our properties in the future.


• | There can be no assurance that we will be able to make distributions to our Operating Partnership unitholders and Class A shareholders or maintain our anticipated level of distributions over time.


• | An increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect the price of our Class A shares.


• | MGP is controlled by MGM, whose interests in our business may conflict with ours or yours.


• | We are dependent on MGM for the provision of administration services to our operations and assets.


• | MGM’s historical results may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.


• | Our operating agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our directors, officers and others.


• | If MGM engages in the same type of business we conduct, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered.


• | The Master Lease and other agreements governing our relationship with MGM were not negotiated on an arm’s-length basis and the terms of those agreements may be less favorable to us than they might otherwise have been in an arm’s-length transaction.


• | In the event of a bankruptcy of the Tenant, a bankruptcy court may determine that the Master Lease is not a single lease but rather multiple severable leases, each of which can be assumed or rejected independently, in which case underperforming leases related to properties we own that are subject to the Master Lease could be rejected by the Tenant while tenant-favorable leases are allowed to remain in place.


• | MGM may undergo a change of control without the consent of us or of our shareholders.


• | If MGP fails to remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


• | Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.


• | The anticipated benefits of our anticipated and future acquisitions may not be realized fully and may take longer to realize than expected.


• | Our ownership of the TRS, which we formed in connection with the Northfield Acquisition, will be subject to limitations, and a failure to comply with the limits could jeopardize our REIT qualification.


• | We may be unable to complete the Northfield OpCo Disposition or the Park MGM Lease Transaction or may not consummate the transactions on the terms described herein.

While forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
You should also be aware that while we from time to time communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any material non-public information, internal forecasts or other confidential business information. Therefore, you should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst, irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports are not our responsibility and are not endorsed by us.
Employees of the Registrants 
We are managed by an executive management team. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,212 other employees aside from our executive management team and including our 1,209 employees at Northfield. MGM has agreed to provide MGP and its subsidiaries with financial, administrative and operational support services pursuant to a corporate services agreement (the “Corporate Services Agreement”), including accounting and finance support, human resources support, legal and regulatory compliance support, insurance advisory services, internal audit services, governmental affairs monitoring and reporting services, information technology support, construction services, and various other support services. The Corporate Services Agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will reimburse MGM for all costs MGM incurs directly related to providing such services.
