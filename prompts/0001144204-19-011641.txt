Customers 
 
While ARRIS is executing on a strategy to diversify its customer base, such as the recent the acquisition of Ruckus, most of our sales today are to cable, telco and satellite multi-channel video and broadband service providers. As the global telecommunications industry continues trending toward consolidation, our sales to the largest service providers remain crucial to our success. Our sales are substantially dependent upon a system operator’s selection of ARRIS’s network equipment, demand for increased broadband services by subscribers, and general capital expenditure levels by system operators.
 
With the acquisition of Ruckus, we anticipate there will be a trend to a greater proportion of our sales being to end customers in hospitality, venues, education, government and smart cities through our channel partners.
 
Our two largest customers (including their affiliates, as applicable) are Charter and Comcast. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in 2018. From time to time, the affiliates included in our revenues from these customers have changed because of mergers and acquisitions. Therefore, the revenue for our customers for prior periods has been adjusted to include, on a comparable basis for all periods presented, the affiliates currently understood to be under common control. Our sales to these customers for the last three years were (in thousands, except percentages):
 

 | Years ended December 31, | 
-----------------------+--------------------------+----------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | 2016
Charter and affiliates | $ | 928,403 | | | $ | 985,237 | | $ 1,064,408 | (1)
% of sales | | 13.8 | % | | | 14.9 | % | 15.6 | % 
Comcast and affiliates | $ | 1,114,238 | | | $ | 1,479,415 | | $ 1,637,519 | (1)
% of sales | | 16.5 | % | | | 22.4 | % | 24.0 | % 


(1) | Revenues were reduced by $30.2 million in 2016, because of warrants held by Charter and Comcast that are intended to incent additional purchases from them. (see Note 18 Warrants of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
ARRIS utilizes standard terms of sale that apply to all customer purchases, except those larger customers with whom we have executed general purchase agreements (“GPAs”). These GPAs do not generally obligate the customer to a specific volume of business. The vast majority of our sales, whether to customers with GPAs or otherwise, result from periodic purchase orders. We have multiple agreements with our largest customers, including Charter and Comcast, based upon their needs or because of prior acquisitions. We maintain these agreements in the normal course of our business.

Research and development expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $644.0 million, $539.1 million and $584.9 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percent of sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 9.5%, 8.1% and 8.6%, respectively. These costs include an allocation of common costs associated with information technology and facilities.
Intellectual Property 
 
We have an active patenting program for protecting our innovations. During 2018, we continued to enhance our patent portfolio. We were awarded 343 patents and filed 380 patent applications. As of January 31, 2019, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of approximately 5,009 issued patents (both U.S. and foreign), including patents acquired in connection with the Ruckus Networks acquisition, and we continue to pursue patent protection on new inventions (currently approximately 1,280 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending).
 
In our effort to pursue new patents, we have created a process whereby employees may submit ideas of inventions for review by patent committees. The review process evaluates each submission based on criteria that includes: novelty, potential commercial value of the invention, and detectability of infringement. Patent applications are filed on these inventions that meet the criteria.
 
Although patents generally have a 20-year legal life, the relevant technologies to which the patents apply often have much shorter lives. As such, the economic useful life of the patents is often the same as that of the associated developed technology.
 
Our patents and patent applications generally are in the areas of telecommunications hardware, software and related technologies. For technology that is not owned by us, we have a program for obtaining appropriate licenses to ensure that we have the necessary license coverage for our products. In addition, we have formed strategic relationships with leading technology companies to provide us with early access to technology that we believe will help keep us at the forefront of our industry.

We also have a program for protecting and developing trademarks. As of January 31, 2019, ARRIS had 769 registered or pending trademark registrations, including trademarks acquired with Ruckus Networks. Our trademark program includes procedures for the use of current trademarks and for the development of new trademarks. This program is designed to ensure that our employees properly use our registered trademarks and any new trademarks that are expected to develop strong brand loyalty and name recognition. The design of our trademark program is intended to protect our trademarks from dilution or cancellation.
 
From time to time there are significant disputes with respect to the ownership of the technology used in our industry and accusations of patent infringements. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
 
Product Sourcing and Distribution 
 
We maintain a balance of both internal manufacturing capabilities and external partners that provide our customers a competitive combination of quality, cost and flexibility. We currently operate manufacturing facilities in Tijuana, Mexico and Manaus, Brazil. We also use contract manufacturers located in Brazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.
 
We provide our contract manufacturers with rolling, non-binding forecasts, and we typically have a minimum of 60 days advanced orders placed with them for production. Purchase orders for delivery within 60 days generally are not cancelable. Purchase orders with delivery dates 60+ days in the future generally may be cancelled with penalties in accordance with each vendor’s terms. Each contract manufacturer provides a minimum 15-month warranty.
 
In December 2018, we sold our manufacturing facility in Hsin Tien, Taiwan to one of our contract manufacturers and moved the production to one of their other locations. The Taiwan facility manufactured a significant portion of our CPE video set-tops and gateways. We manufacture a limited amount of CPE video set-tops in Manaus, Brazil to serve the local market. The factory is 59,202 square feet, and, as of December 31, 2018, the facility employed approximately 130 people. Current outsourcing arrangements include the manufacture of set-tops, modems, DTAs and IP set-tops.
 
We manufacture a portion of our Network & Cloud products in our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. The factory is 128,124 square feet, and, as of December 31, 2018, the facility employed approximately 1,000 people. We also leverage contract manufacturing partners for other products including CMTS, amplifiers, certain power supplies, accessories, optical modules, digital return modules, circuit boards, repair services, and video infrastructure equipment.
 
We outsource the production of Enterprise products to contract manufacturers.
 
In order to address the recently enacted U.S./China import tariffs on Broadband CPE equipment, we are in the process of shifting production to non-China locations. The re-location of manufacturing is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.
 
We distribute a substantial number of products that are not produced by us to provide our customers with a comprehensive portfolio offering. Domestically, we distribute hardware and installation products through regional warehouses in California, North Carolina, and Washington. Internationally, we distribute through regional warehouses in Australia, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and Netherlands, and through drop shipments from our contract manufacturers located throughout the world.
 
We obtain key components from numerous third-party suppliers. Our supply agreements include technology licensing and component purchase contracts. Several of our competitors have similar supply agreements for these components. In addition, we license software for operating network and security systems or sub-systems and a variety of routing protocols from different suppliers.
 
We primarily sell our Enterprise Networks products indirectly through a large network of value-added resellers and distributors, which we collectively refer to as channel partners. Our channel partners provide lead generation, pre-sales support, product fulfillment and, in certain circumstances, post-sales customer service and support. In some instances, service providers may also act as a channel partner for sales of our solutions to enterprises. In certain circumstances, we do sell Enterprise Networks products directly to end- customers, but it is a relatively small part of the overall business.
 
Backlog 
 
Our backlog consists of unfilled customer orders (believed to be firm and long-term contracts) that have not been completed. With respect to long-term contracts, we include in our backlog only amounts representing orders currently released for production or, in specific instances, the amount we expect to be released in the succeeding 12 months. The amount contained in backlog for any contract or order may not be the total amount of the contract or order. The amount of our backlog at any given time does not reflect expected revenues for any fiscal period.
 
Our backlog at December 31, 2018 was approximately $966.2 million, at December 31, 2017 was approximately $1,121.4 million, and at December 31, 2016 was approximately $1,106.3 million. We believe that all the backlog existing at December 31, 2018 will be shipped in 2019.

We distinguish our products based on reliability and performance, differentiated features, flexibility, breadth, customer service, and availability of business solutions, while pricing our solutions competitively with those of other competitors.
 
Consumer demand for more bandwidth is a fundamental driver behind the continued growth in CMTS and CCAP Edge Routing capacity deployed by service providers worldwide. The CMTS/CCAP supplier space is highly competitive with strong historical players such as Cisco and newer products, particularly focused on the trend towards DAA, from manufacturers such as Casa, Harmonic, Nokia, Teleste and Vecima.
 
ARRIS is a worldwide leader in CMTS and CCAP. Our portfolio of IP network solutions continues to provide the scale and efficiency to power service providers’ transition to next-generation networks and services. Showcase solutions like our E6000® Converged Edge Router are driving this global momentum and are responsible for providing service to millions of subscribers through the world’s leading service providers.
 
ARRIS is a worldwide leader in CPE equipment. Our primary competitors are Technicolor S.A., Sagemcom, Humax, and Huawei. We compete in video set-tops/gateways, DOCSIS, DSL, and FTTH solutions. This positions ARRIS to capitalize on several key industry opportunities: 1) the set-top’s evolution into the gateway for all communications, media, and other connected services; 2) the shift to gigabit Wi-Fi and its growing role as a principal conduit for the connected home; 3) the refresh cycle of today’s broadly deployed base of set-tops and broadband gateways; and 4) the evolution and hybridization of network standards and models, from xDSL to G.Fast, D3.1 to xPON, new IP video services, and more. ARRIS is also introducing products to address the emerging Fixed Wireless Access (“FWA”) approach to using high bandwidth fixed radio communications as a lower cost or higher capacity alternative to twisted pair, coax, or fiber physical connections between the edge of the network and the home or business.
 
Our multi-screen content management and protection products compete with many vendors offering on-demand video and digital advertising insertion hardware and software, including Adobe, Cisco, Ericsson, Irdeto, SeaChange, TiVo, Verimatrix, and others. Our operations management systems compete with vendors offering network management, mobile workforce management, network configuration management, and network capacity management systems such as Oracle (formerly TOA Technologies), Click Software, Guavus and others, some of which may currently have greater sales in these areas than ARRIS. In some instances, our customers internally develop their own software for these functions. However, we believe that we offer a more integrated solution that gives us a competitive advantage in supporting the requirements of both today’s distribution networks and the emerging all-digital, packet-based networks.

We also compete with companies such as Cisco, Harmonic, Huawei, Nokia, Teleste, Technetix, Vecima and ZTE for network distribution and access equipment. In recent periods, competition in this market has increased from aftermarket suppliers, whose primary focus is on the refurbishment of OEM equipment, resulting in additional competition for new sales opportunities. In addition, because of the convergence of the cable and telecommunications sectors and rapid technological development, new competitors may enter this market
 
Our enterprise and service provider Wi-Fi and campus switching products compete with companies including Aerohive, Cisco, Ericsson, H3C, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Nokia and Ubiquiti, some of which have greater sales in these areas than ARRIS.
 
Lastly, some of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources and product breadth than us. This may enable them to bundle products or be able to market and price products more aggressively than we can.
 
Regulation and Corporate Responsibility 
 
Our products and operations are subject to numerous U.S. and international regulations and requirements in the areas of labor, environmental compliance, including energy efficiency standards, health and safety and ethics. We are committed to strong corporate responsibility, and in 2018, we continued our participation as a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”), a non-profit coalition of electronics companies dedicated to supporting the rights and wellbeing of workers and communities affected by the global electronics supply chain. We continue to work with our suppliers by utilizing the RBA process collaboratively to improve working and environmental conditions through industry leading standards and practices to drive continual improvement and mitigate risk. Additional information regarding these policies and programs is available under the “Investors” tab of our corporate website (www.arris.com).
 
As signatories to the Voluntary Agreement for Ongoing Improvement to the Energy Efficiency of Set-Top Boxes and Small Network Equipment in the U.S., the SCTE/ISBE’s Energy 2020 initiative, the Voluntary Industry Agreement to Improve the Energy Consumption of Complex Set-Top Boxes in the European Union and the Canadian Pay-TV Set-Top Box Energy Efficiency Voluntary Agreement, we continue to be committed to reducing our environmental impact through increasing the energy efficiency of our products while still protecting our need to adapt to rapidly changing technology and the introduction of new features.
 
Modern Slavery 
 
We are dedicated to ensuring that human rights are respected at all times. We have implemented a number of business policies to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, our contractors and our suppliers’ employees. We require that our suppliers conduct themselves in a lawful and ethical manner and maintain high standards. Aligning with the requirements of the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, our Supplier Code of Conduct requires that our suppliers not use forced, bonded or involuntary prison labor or child labor when producing products. To enforce the Supplier Code of Conduct, we audit our product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Under our supply contracts, we have the right to audit all suppliers for compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We also mandate annual employee training that covers human trafficking. This annual training emphasizes our requirement that our suppliers also must comply with the ARRIS Supplier Code of Conduct.
Employees 
 
As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately 7,900 employees. ARRIS has no employees represented by unions within the United States. We believe that we have a strong relationship with our employees. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. We have entered into employment contracts with our key executive officers and have confidentiality agreements with substantially all our employees. We also have long-term incentive programs that are intended to provide substantial incentives for our key employees to remain with us.
