Item 1. Description of Business
Introduction
 
Merion, Inc. is a provider of health and nutritional supplements and personal care products. Currently, we mainly sell our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors through phone and electronic communication. Our major customers of our nutritional and beauty products are located in the Asian market, predominantly in the People’s Republic of China. Our major customers of our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) and packaging products are located in the United States.
Company History
 
Merion, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed on February 4, 2011. Its predecessor, E-World USA Holding, Inc., was a California company incorporated in 2007 (“E-World CA”). In April 2011, E-World CA entered into a merger agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary with the same name, E-World USA Holding, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“E-World NV”), that was the survivor of the merger and became the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company issued 90,000,000 shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of E-World CA’s common stock issued and outstanding at the date of the merger. In addition, the Company issued its Type A Warrants and Type B Warrants in exchange for comparable warrants issued and outstanding of E-World CA at the date of the merger. On June 27, 2017, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada to change its name effective immediately, from E-World NV, to Merion, Inc. 
Products
 
In June 2014, we suspended our direct marketing model in China in response to the legal action taken by the Chinese authorities. Since June 2014, we have sold our products primarily over the Internet directly to end-user customers and by phone/email orders directly to our wholesale distributors. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who walk into the Company offices and customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling health and nutritional supplements and personal care products directly on the Internet through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com. As of the date of filing of this report, we market twelves individual nutritional supplement products, four of which were introduced in 2018, and one beauty product, which was also introduced in 2018, on these websites. We are no longer selling similar products of third parties on our websites.
 
In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the Seller’s manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Asset Sale”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”) valued at $320,000. The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. With the purchase of these assets, we started to manufacture some of the nutritional supplements that we sell. These assets meet all industry nutritional and dietary supplement manufacturing standards, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Good Manufacturing Practice compliance and Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. In addition to manufacturing the nutritional supplements that we sell, we have the ability to produce hard capsules, tablets, solid beverages (sachet packaging), teabags, powder, granules, dietary supplements, softgel capsules and health foods from these assets for any potential new customers who need such products. These are the products that were added to our existing products, similar to our OEM and packaging businesses. 
 
Company Products
 
Our nutritional supplement products are made according to a micro molecular nutrition formula. To achieve the maximum effect of products, micro molecular health foods were designed to be absorbed by cells directly with minimum chemical conversion, which we believe promotes faster absorption. We believe our company is one of only a few companies in the market which are using a micro molecular nutrition formula.
 
In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). Copies of these two inspection reports were filed as exhibits to the Company’s Form 10-K for 2015 filed on February 7, 2017. As a result, we were able to directly export these products to the China market and sell them at nutritional supplement stores in China as food, rather than only through our website. However, we are still exploring potential wholesale distributors to import these products.

In June and July 2017, we introduced three new nutritional supplement products: Hepaticia, Auxia, and Capsule of Beauty. In October 2017, we introduced two nutritional supplement products: AntiGrey and Cell Vitality. Hepacticia is a nutritional supplement product that may support liver health. Auxia is a nutritional supplement that may support kidney health. Capsule of Beauty is a nutritional supplement that may prevent wrinkles and support nail health. AntiGrey is a nutritional supplement that may prevent grey hair. Cell Vitality is a nutritional supplement that may support eye health. As of the date of filing of this report, we are no longer selling Hepaticia, Auxia, Capsule of Beauty, AntiGrey and Cell Vitality, as the market demands for these products were not up to our expectations. 
 
In January 2018, we introduced a new beauty product, Noir Naturel, a gentle formula for grey coverage from the first application into hair. 
 
In September 2018, we introduced three different types of natural aphrodisiac supplements for men that may support kidney health, improve immunity, enhance physical fitness, eliminate fatigue, improve sexual desire and enhance body energy, strength and sexual ability. 
 
In 2019, we anticipate introducing 1) Lady-S, a female dietary supplement that may assist on weight loss, 2) Gold King, a nutritional supplement that may provide antioxidant support and liver health, 3) New Power, a nutritional supplement that may support heart health, 4) Taibao, a nutritional supplement that may enhance physical performance and energy metabolism, and 5) M-Power, a nutritional supplement that may provide anti-aging support. 
 
The nutritional supplements’ and beauty products’ formulas do not have patent protection.

Return and Refund Policy for Our Products
 
Merion guarantees the quality of its products, and will exchange any product found to be defective. Additionally, customers can apply for a 90% refund of the original purchase price of purchased products within 60 days of purchase. When products are returned, they must be unopened and resalable. All shipping fees for product exchanges or returns must be fully paid by customers. All of the returned products must not be damaged and must be within the valid shelf-life period specified on the product label. In addition to the Company’s 60-day return policy, the Company, at its discretion, may accept a customer’s application for a buy-back of products previously sold within one year at 90% of the original product costs less commissions and shipping costs.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no return of products.

Sourcing and Production
 
Our Products
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we acquired our ingredients from the suppliers and contracted for production of our proprietary products from manufacturers that we believe are reliable, reputable and deliver high quality materials, products and services. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we also acquired our ingredients from suppliers for direct production in our Nevada factory. In 2018, three suppliers accounted for approximately 47.4% of our purchases: Sunland Nutrition Inc. (12.6%), Pure Valley Nutrition (12.1%), and McGoGene, LLC (22.7%). In 2017, three suppliers accounted for approximately 94.0% of our purchases: SUSS Technology Corp. (29.3%), Oxyultra Inc. (25.1%), and McGoGene, LLC (39.6%). The loss of one or more of these suppliers could result in a potential loss of our sales and revenues if we cannot find a substitute quickly or upon favorable terms.
 
The Company does not have a written or contractual agreement with our other suppliers or manufacturers. Our product ingredient sourcing and other manufacturing requirements are conducted on a purchase-order basis. If one or more of our current suppliers stopped selling us ingredients and/or if one or more of our current manufacturers stopped manufacturing our products, we would be forced to find other suppliers and manufacturers. The time needed to find other suppliers or manufacturers could outlast the inventory on hand and result in loss of sales.
 
We maintain good relationships with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate such relationships in the near term. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event that we become unable to source any products or ingredients from our major suppliers, we believe that we would be able to produce or replace those products or substitute source these ingredients from our secondary and tertiary suppliers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.
 
In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Asset Sale”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”). The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Having purchased these assets from the Seller, we have begun manufacturing some of the nutritional supplements that we sell. These assets meet all industry nutritional and dietary supplements manufacturing standards, including FDA and GMP compliance and cGMP regulations. In addition to manufacturing the nutritional supplements that we sell, we also anticipate starting production of hard capsules, tablets, solid beverage (sachet packaging), teabags, powder, granules, dietary supplements for export, softgel capsules and healthy food from these assets for any potential new customers who need this product. 
 
For nutritional products and beauty products, we purchase our ingredients from third parties and contract with a third-party manufacturer for further processing the raw materials into final products to be sold. We did not own a manufacturing plant for product processing prior to January 1, 2018. We only provided self-developed formulas to be manufactured. Our company is able to obtain the ingredients necessary for production of our nutritional supplements. 
 
We also maintain good relationships with our manufacturers and do not anticipate that any of our manufacturers will terminate such relationships in the near term. In the event we become unable have our products manufactured by our major manufacturers, we believe that we would be able to reallocate production to our other manufacturers or locate other manufacturers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.
 
In addition, we maintain good relationships with our wholesale distributors in China and our OCM and packing customers and do not anticipate that any of those parties will terminate such relationships in the near term. In 2018, two customers accounted for approximately 39.5% of our sales: Nanyu Zhu (27.4%) and Yan Zhu. (12.1 %). In 2017, two customers accounted for approximately 51.2% of our sales: Nanyu Zhu (36.4%) and Meiwen Yu (14.8%). The loss of one or more customers could result in a potential loss of our sales and a negative effect on our operations if we cannot find one or more substitutes.

Industry Analysis
 
The nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to enhance the body’s performance and wellness. The four major product categories within the nutrition industry are:

· | Nutritional Supplements – products such as vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, herbs and botanicals and compounds derived from these substances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Natural and Organic Foods – products such as cereals, milk, non-diary beverages and frozen entrees. 
· | Functional Foods – products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes. 

 
The nutritional supplement market is characterized by:
 

· | Large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Retail consumers’ emphasis on value pricing. 
· | Constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research. 
· | Low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty, rapid change, widely available manufacturing, low regulatory requirements and ready access to large distribution channels, such as the Internet and retail stores selling nutritional supplements and other direct marketing companies.
· | A lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient sources, potency, purity, absorption rate and form. 

Competition
 
The market for nutritional products is large and intensely competitive. The Company competes directly with companies that manufacture and market nutritional products. The Company competes with other companies in the nutritional products industry by emphasizing the uniqueness, value and premium quality of the Company’s products and convenience of the Company’s Internet sales system. Many of the Company’s competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than the Company. In addition, nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While the Company believes that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through the Internet, the buying habits of many consumers accustomed to purchasing products through traditional retail channels are difficult to change. The Company’s product offerings are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other nutritional product companies.
Marketing Plan
 
The Company promotes its products through its websites and newspaper advertisements. During the early stages of website implementation, the Company offered coupon codes for certain products to generate sales and website traffic, but has since discontinued this practice.
 
The majority of the Company’s sales on nutritional and beauty products were generated from China for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Since June 2014, we mainly sold our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors. In March 2016, we launched an Affiliate Marketing Program, which has already been terminated. 
 
We believe that consumers have become more confident in ordering products like ours over the Internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care product e-business markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive, and are rapidly evolving. 
 
The Company’s marketing approach also use the Company’s CEO sales network and relationships to approach distributors to purchase the Company’s products in fiscal year 2018 and 2017.

Share Distribution Plans
 
1) On July 15, 2017, the Board approved Mr. Dinghua Wang, the Chairman and CEO of the Company, to distribute up to thirty million of his own shares to certain persons outside of the United States who have previously worked with the Company as an incentive for these individuals to assist the Company to develop its international market. Accordingly, special legends regarding restrictions on resale of the securities and no-hedging transactions would need to be included on the securities. 
 
As of the date of this report, Mr. Wang had distributed 1,500,000 shares pursuant to this plan. All of these 1,500,000 shares were distributed on February 14, 2018 pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined that these shares distributed by Mr. Wang were related to the Company’s operations in accordance to ASC 220-10-S99-4. The fair value of these shares were valued at $480,000 and recorded as stock-based compensation expenses in the Company’s year ended December 31, 2018 consolidated statements of operations. 
 
2) On July 28, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved Mr. Dinghua Wang, the Chairman and CEO of the Company, to distribute up to five million of his own shares to the people who, directly or indirectly, loaned funds or referred customers to the Company or purchased products from the Company as the Company faces financial difficulty. To the extent that these share distributions are being made to anyone outside of the U.S., those distributions will be made under Regulation S and must contain appropriate Regulation S subscription agreements and legends. If anyone within U.S. is to receive those shares, the Company must consult with the Company counsel to comply with U.S. securities laws. 
 
As of the date of this report, Mr. Wang had distributed 4,181,592 shares pursuant to this plan. All of these 4,181,592 shares were distributed on February 14, 2018. The Company determined that these 4,181,592 shares distributed by Mr. Wang were at his own discretion and the recipients of the shares did not expect such distribution at the time when they, directly or indirectly, loaned funds or referred customers to the Company or purchased products from the Company as the Company faces financial difficulty. 
 
3) On June 30, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the grant of up to twenty million shares (from authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock) to persons outside the U.S. who sell Company products, based on their sales performance in the future. The Company must determine that this type of incentive compensation is legal and appropriate for each country in which it is utilized. For ease of administration, this plan has been, and will continue to be, implemented solely for persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued 64,500 shares to the Company’s sales agents outside the U.S. The shares are valued at $32,249, determined using the monthly closing price of the Company’s common stock on the applicable issuance dates, and recognized in the captioned “selling expenses” in the accompanying statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We have no registered trademarks or patents in the United States. We have common law ownership rights under U.S. trade secret law for the formulations for eleven of our twelve Nutritional Supplements (all except O2 Cell Power).

The Company has obtained a Trademark Registration in China for the name of “DailyNu” with trademark application number 20683305. Under Chinese law, this trademark is valid for an indefinite period, as there is no expiration date. 
 
Other than the aforementioned trademarks, we do not own any other registered trademarks, trade names or other governmentally approved intellectual property rights for those products.
 
Research and Development
 
In 2018, we continued our efforts to internally develop an online platform called “E-Hospital”. We anticipate that E-Hospital will provide the latest and the most advanced U.S. health care information and products, including legally exported nutrition supplements and newly-released medication for local hospitals and other medical institutes, in China through the Internet. We are in the process of contacting doctors who will be partnering with our E-Hospital platform to provide periodic video consultation and overseas medical lectures to promote the exchange of medical information and developments. The collaboration of E-Hospital with overseas local hospitals will strengthen the recognition, popularity and reputation of overseas local hospitals, as well as expand the market share and increase the competitiveness of these hospitals. 
 
We expect that the E-Hospital Services will eventually provide the following benefits:
 

· | High quality remote treatment anywhere, to suit individual lifestyles; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Coordinate medication delivered directly to patients; 
· | Facilitate access to the latest US medical treatments; 
· | Provide an internet forum for communication and sharing between doctors and doctors, doctors and patients, or patient to patient; and 
· | Facilitate access to safe and high quality nutritional supplements, which are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in polluted countries such as China.

 
The E-Hospital Services will also include the following:
 

· | Facilitate access to effective advanced medication, therapeutic nutritional supplements and health products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Facilitate access to cutting-edge medical health knowledge; 
· | Coordinate prescriptions, legally issued by all E-Hospital affiliated doctors; 
· | Feature services and new medications promoted by our local hospital partners; 
· | Provide access to live video consultations with U.S. doctors, medical lectures, and product shipping and customer service;

 
As we are currently developing the E-Hospital platform, we do not have an estimate for when we will ready to launch the platform. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully to launch the platform. The Company has currently put the project on hold in 2019. 
 
Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $7,549 and $1,310, respectively.

Government Regulation
 
Given uncertainties relating to our compliance with personal network marketing laws in foreign jurisdictions, the Company discontinued sales through the network marketing model in 2014, and began selling directly to end-user customers from our website. 
 
We believe we are no longer subject to personal network marketing regulations. Nonetheless, we are still subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. Various governmental agencies have an impact on our business, including but not limited to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Regulations promulgated by the FDA cover product ingredients, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sales, compensation and taxation, to name a few. All of our products have certificates of free sales issued by the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. If the Company were to fail to meet standards required by these regulations, then the Company could be prohibited from selling its products.
 
The Company plans to export its Dibeier Products into China to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores, rather than only through our websites. Under Chinese law, to import these products into China, the Company must provide the Inspection Report from the Provincial Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution. In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). The Company also obtained the Product Chinese Name registration from local SAIC and the trademark registration in September 2016 from the Trademark Office of State Administration for Industry & Commerce of China (“SAIC”). The Company currently has no binding contracts or agreements with any person or entity in China to purchase and import the Dibeier Products. The Company is currently reviewing U.S. and Chinese import/export regulations regarding the sale of Dibeier Products and will not commence the export and sale of Dibeier Products until it believes that it is fully in compliance with these regulations.

We have the following employees:
 

· | Full time: 11 
--+-------------------
· | Operations – 6 
· | Administrative – 2
· | Management – 2

We have no collective bargaining agreement with our employees. We consider our relationships with our employees to be excellent.
