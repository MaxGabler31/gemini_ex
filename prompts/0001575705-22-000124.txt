Description of Our Business
 
Our corporate history
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on September 30, 2005, and previously operated under the name of Peak Resource Incorporated. In August 2008, we changed our name to “Mine Clearing Corporation”. We had been operating as an exploration division in the mining sector until May 2014. On May 2, 2014, we acquired all of the shares of Clickstream Corporation, a Nevada corporation. Subsequent to the acquisition, we were operating as a data analytics tool developer and had sought to further develop and exploit our data analytics technology and proprietary algorithms. Currently, we are a technology company focused on developing apps and digital platforms that disrupt conventional industries. We’re currently marketing and developing WinQuik, HeyPal, Nifter & Joey’s Animal Kingdom respectively.
 
The address of our virtual executive office is 8549 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2181, Beverly Hills, California 90211, and our telephone number is (213) 205-0684.
 
Overview
 
Over the last few years, there has been a substantial increase in the availability and quality of applications readily available from sources such as Google Play Store and Apple Play Store for various types of gaming. The initial objective of the Company is to develop apps and digital platforms that disrupt conventional industries. The Company is currently marketing and developing WinQuik™, HeyPal™, Nifter™ and Joeys Animal Kingdon™ respectively. WinQuik™, is a free-to-play synchronized mobile app and digital gaming platform. The platform is designed to enable WinQuik™ users to have fun, interact and compete in order to win real money and prizes. WinQuik™ website is currently under construction as ClickStream considers revamping the Platform to give it a new improved form, structure and appearance. HeyPal™, a unit of our subsidiary Nebula Software Corp., is a language learning app that focuses on “language exchanging” between users around the world. Nifter™, by way of ClickStream subsidiary Rebel Blockchain Inc., is a music NFT marketplace that allows artists to create, sell and discover unique music and sound NFTs on the Nifter™ marketplace. Joey’s Animal Kingdom™ is a children’s entertainment and education app that takes kids all around this amazing planet to see incredible animals and creatures.
 
In September 2021, the Company acquired approximately 53% of Winners, Inc. (WNRS) which together with its prior holdings gives an approximate 55% interest in the common stock of WNRS. Due to the existence of super-voting preferred stock of WNRS, the Company has a vote of approximately 5%. However, management has concluded that Winners, Inc and its subsidiary VegasWinners, Inc. should be considered as an investment in equity method investee.
 
Business Plan
 
The company currently has four product lines.
 
WinQuik™, is a free-to-play synchronized mobile app and digital gaming platform. The platform is designed to enable WinQuik™ users to have fun, interact and compete in order to win real money and prizes.

HeyPal™, by way of ClickStream subsidiary Nebula Software Corp., is a language learning app that focuses on “language exchanging” between users around the world. As opposed to quizzes, flash cards and other traditional language studying tools, HeyPal™’s approach to helping its users learn a new language is by matching them together with native speakers of their target language. For example, if User A speaks English, and wants to learn French, HeyPal™ will match the user with User B who speaks fluent French and wishes to learn English. This approach makes the language learning process more fun, engaging, and encourages faster learning speed. HeyPal™ also has many social media features, including posts and media uploading to “language boards”, allowing users to post original content and be immersed completely in the language they are learning. Nebula intends to monetize HeyPal™ by integrating a unique and effective premium subscription model that will allow users to gain access to certain features that will enhance their social language experience.

Nifter™ 
 
On March 19, 2021, we acquired Rebel Blockchain, Inc., which is the creator of Nifter™, a marketplace for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. At the time of the acquisition, Rebel Blockchain had nominal assets and no operations. The development of the platform will include front-end, back-end and blockchain smart-contract development, and, upon launch, the platform will be “live” for users to access and use the platform It is expected that as of the launch Rebel Blockchain will have no customers or commitments from customers.
Joey’s Animal Kingdom™:
 
On or about April 14, 2020, we formed Joey’s Animal Kingdom™, a children’s entertainment and education app that takes kids all around this amazing planet to see incredible animals and creatures. WOWEEAPP.COM is not just a place to watch videos and learn about animals, but it has many other features such as live quizzes and games as well as kid profiles and VS games. Joey is a little boy who lives in the jungle with his pet and best friend, Mochi, a chimpanzee. Joey has spent his younger life traveling the world with his parents’ visiting zoos and helping animals all around the world. His passion for animals has now led him to help educate other kids about the amazing planet we live on and all the animals that need our help!

Properties
 
We do not own or lease any offices at this time other than a “virtual office” at the address set forth on the cover page of this Annual Report. We plan to lease general office space sufficient for our current needs and additional needs of additional personnel in the foreseeable future.
Governmental and Industry Regulation
 
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations, including privacy laws and federal securities laws.

EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL
 
We currently have three part-time employees and no full-time employees. Michael Handelman has been appointed our Secretary and Chief Financial Officer, Frank Magliochetti has been appointed our Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas Terwilliger has been appointed our Controller, with each such individual retained on an independent contractor basis. Each of Messrs. Handelman, Magliochetti, and Terwilliger work at their own offices, make their own schedules and work with other clients. Messrs. Handelman, Magliochetti and Terwilliger spend approximately 20 hours per week on our matters with the expectation that Mr. Magliochetti’s and Mr. Handelman’s time commitment will increase as our business grows. However, we do plan to hire a full-time Chief Executive Officer when we have the financial resources to do so.
 
We have relied and plan on continuing to rely on independent organizations, advisors and consultants to perform certain services for us, including handling substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, product development, marketing, and sales. Such services may not always be available to us on a timely basis or at costs that we can afford. Our future performance will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired officers and to engage and retain consultants, as well as our ability to develop an effective working relationship with our management and consultants.
