Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 We are a provider of inpatient and outpatient substance use treatment services for individuals with drug addiction, alcohol addiction and co-occurring mental/behavioral health issues. In connection with our treatment services, we perform clinical diagnostic laboratory services and provide physician services to our clients. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 11 inpatient substance abuse treatment facilities located throughout the United States, focused on delivering effective clinical care and treatment solutions across 1,080 inpatient beds, including 700 licensed detoxification beds, 24 standalone outpatient centers and 4 sober living facilities across 471 beds for a total of 1,551 combined inpatient and sober living beds.
 4


Our highly trained clinical staff deploy research-based treatment programs with structured curricula for detoxification, inpatient treatment, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient care. By applying a tailored treatment program based on the individual needs of each client, many of whom require treatment for a co-occurring mental health disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, we believe we offer the level of quality care and service necessary for our clients to achieve and maintain sobriety.
 The Company was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on February 12, 2014 for the purpose of acquiring the common stock of AAC and to engage in certain reorganization transactions in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock, which was completed in October 2014 (the “IPO”). AAC was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on February 27, 2007.
 Business Strategy
 We have developed our company and the American Addictions Centers national brand through substantial investment in our clinical expertise, our facilities, our professional staff and our national sales and marketing program. We seek to extend our position as a leading provider of treatment for drug and alcohol addiction by executing the following growth strategies:

• | Clinical excellence and outcomes-driven treatment. We seek to set the national standard for quality and outcomes in addiction treatment. AAC is committed to ongoing measurement and transparency regarding patient outcomes, as evidenced by the publication in 2018 of a three-year outcomes study, which is available on our website. Information from this study or our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. In addition to measurement of patient outcomes and satisfaction with treatment, we are continually working to advance utilization of modern, evidence-based interventions that address addiction as a chronic brain disease, as supported by the science. We believe AAC is now well-positioned to be a national quality leader in addiction treatment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve census at existing facilities. We seek to connect with potential patients through a multi-faceted program that involves education about the disease of addiction and the development of relationships with healthcare professionals throughout the United States, digital marketing of various forms, as well as such traditional channels as television, radio and print advertising. Through this multi-faceted approach, we generate significant inbound call volume to our admissions center. Our admissions center takes consultative, empathetic approach that we believe allows our personnel to effectively identify and enroll clients who may benefit from our treatment service offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target complementary growth opportunities. There are additional growth opportunities that we are selectively pursuing that are complementary to our current business. These include, without limitation, providing laboratory services to other substance abuse treatment providers and expanding other ancillary services. For example, our high complexity, mass spectrometry laboratories are capable of providing full service clinical diagnostic testing (including toxicology, hematology, chemistry, infectious disease, hormones and genetics) in multiple states.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively expand outpatient operations. We selectively pursue opportunities to add outpatient centers to complement our broader network of inpatient treatment facilities. We believe expanding our reach by developing or acquiring premium outpatient facilities of a quality consistent with our inpatient services will further enhance our brand and our ability to provide a more comprehensive suite of services across the spectrum of care. Outpatient centers are expected to be an increasingly important source of referrals for our inpatient programs as we believe a portion of clients receiving outpatient treatment will ultimately need a higher level of care. Moreover, we believe this will position us to better serve those clients whose payors require outpatient treatment as a prerequisite to any inpatient treatment. We also make available sober living accommodations to clients completing treatment at lower levels of care. These sober living arrangements enable us to utilize existing beds for clients requiring higher levels of care while still providing an interim environment for clients transitioning from inpatient treatment centers to lower levels of care and eventually back to their former living arrangements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue de novo development of facilities. De novo development plays an important role in the growth of our facility base. Our de novo facility development consists of either building a new facility from the ground up or acquiring an existing facility with an alternative use and repurposing it as a substance abuse treatment facility. We have developed multiple full-service inpatient treatment facilities: Greenhouse, a former luxury spa in Dallas, Texas; Desert Hope, a former assisted living facility in Las Vegas, Nevada; River Oaks, a former adolescent behavioral facility in Riverview (Tampa area), Florida; and Laguna Treatment Hospital, a chemical dependency recovery hospital in Aliso Viejo, California, which is the first such hospital designation for one of our treatment facilities. We believe the success of these facilities provides us with the experience to develop additional premium facilities across the United States with comparable scale, capabilities and quality.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Opportunistically diversify our portfolio of treatment facilities. We selectively seek opportunities to expand and diversify our geographic presence, service offerings and the portion of the population that can access our services based on their individual healthcare coverage through acquisitions. All acquisitions of treatment providers we have completed since the completion of our IPO have involved the acquisition of in-network providers. As we continue to expand, we plan to establish greater payor mix diversification between out-of-network, in-network, government (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) and private pay clients. IBISWorld, an industry research organization, estimates that there were approximately 12,000 mental health and substance abuse treatment companies in operation in 2018, most of which are small, regional operations. We believe this high level of fragmentation presents us with the opportunity to acquire facilities or small providers and upgrade their treatment programs and facilities to improve client care and as a result improve our operating metrics. We believe that our brand recognition, marketing platform and referral network will enable us to improve census at acquired facilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Services and Solutions
 We provide quality, comprehensive and compassionate care to adults struggling with alcohol and/or drug abuse and dependence as well as co-occurring mental health issues. We maintain a research-based, disciplined treatment plan for all clients with schedules designed to engage the client in an enriched recovery experience. Our purpose and passion is to empower the individual, their families and the broader community through the promotion of optimal wellness of the mind, body and spirit. 
 Our curriculum, which is peer reviewed and research-based, has been recognized as one of our program strengths by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”), a leader in the promotion and accreditation of quality, value and optimal outcomes of service. In particular, research studies show that certain aspects of our treatment programs, such as offering longer treatment stays, are effective for producing long-term recovery. In addition, we offer a variety of forms of therapy types, settings and related services that the National Institute on Drug Abuse has recognized as effective. We offer the following types of therapy: motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, solution-focused therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and systematic family intervention. Our variety of therapy settings includes individual, group and family therapies, recovery-oriented challenge therapies, expressive therapies (with a focus on music and art), equine and trauma therapies. 
 We also provide Medicated-Assisted Treatment (“MAT”), which is the use of FDA-approved medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a “whole-patient” approach to the treatment of substance use disorders. We believe that it is particularly effective for treating certain conditions such as opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder and tobacco use disorder. The use of MAT has been shown to significantly reduce overdoses from opioids and to improve long-term abstinence. MAT is an important and integral treatment modality that we deploy when appropriate based upon individual patient need.
 Considering the high level of co-occurring substance abuse, mental health and medical conditions, we offer clients a spectrum of psychiatric, medical and wellness-focused services based upon individual needs as assessed through comprehensive evaluations at admission and throughout participation in the program. To maximize the likelihood of long-term recovery, all program levels provide clients access to the following services: assessment of individual substance abuse, mental health, medical history and physical condition promptly upon admission; psychiatric evaluations; psychological evaluations and services based on client needs; follow-up appointments with physicians and psychiatrists; medication monitoring; educational classes regarding health risks, nutrition, smoking cessation, HIV awareness, life skills, healthy nutritional programs and dietary plans; access to fitness facilities; interactive wellness activities such as swimming, basketball and yoga and structured daily schedules designed for restorative sleep patterns. 
 We emphasize clinical treatment, as well as the therapeutic value of overall physical and nutritional wellness. We are committed to providing fresh and nutritious meals throughout a client’s stay in order to promote healthy routines, beginning with diet and exercise. Some of our facilities offer comprehensive work-out facilities, and many locations offer various exercise classes and other amenities. We support long-term recovery for clients through research-based methodologies and individualized treatment planning while utilizing 12 step programs, which are a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery. 
 We believe we have a differentiated ability to manage dual diagnosis cases and coordinate treatment of individuals suffering from the common combination of mental illness and substance abuse simultaneously. These clients participate in education and discussion-oriented groups designed to provide information regarding the psychiatric disorders that co-occur with chemical dependency. 
 We place a strong emphasis on tracking client satisfaction scores in order to measure our client and staff interaction and overall outcome and reputation. In addition to client satisfaction surveys that we receive after a client’s discharge, we also solicit feedback during a client’s stay at our inpatient facilities. This allows us to further tailor an individual’s treatment plan to emphasize the programs that have been more impactful to a particular client.

We believe in tracking clinical outcomes. We partnered with Centerstone Research Institute to conduct independent three-year longitudinal outcome studies on the effectiveness of our clinical approach and released the results in 2018. This study is available on our website. We intend to continue to measure outcomes going forward in order to drive continual improvement in our programs.
 As detailed below, we offer a full spectrum of treatment services to clients, based upon individual needs as assessed through comprehensive evaluations at admission and throughout their participation in the program. The assignment and frequency of services corresponds to individualized treatment plans within the context of the level of care and treatment intensity level.
 Detoxification (“detox”). Detoxification is usually conducted at an inpatient facility for clients with physical or psychological dependence. Detoxification services are designed to clear toxins out of the body so that the body can safely adjust and heal itself after being dependent upon a substance. Clients are medically monitored 24 hours per day, seven days per week by experienced medical professionals who work to alleviate withdrawal symptoms through medication, as appropriate. We provide detoxification services for several substances including alcohol, sedatives and opiates. 
 Residential Treatment. Residential care is a structured treatment approach designed to prepare clients to return to the general community with a sober lifestyle, increased functionality and improved overall wellness. Treatment is provided on a 24 hours per day, seven days per week basis, and services generally include a minimum of two individual therapy sessions per week, regular group therapy, family therapy, didactic and psycho-educational groups, exercise (if cleared by medical staff), case management and recreational activities. Medical and psychiatric care is available to all clients, as needed, through our contracted professional physician groups. 
 Partial Hospitalization. Partial hospitalization is a structured program providing care a minimum of 20 hours per week. This program is designed for clients who are stable enough physically and psychologically to participate in everyday activities but who still require a degree of medical monitoring. Services include a minimum of weekly individual therapy, regular group therapy, family education and therapy, didactic and psycho-educational groups, exercise (if cleared by medical staff), case management and off-site recovery meetings and activities. Medical and psychiatric care is available to all clients, as needed, through our contracted professional physician groups. 
 Intensive Outpatient Services. Less intensive than the aforementioned levels of care, intensive outpatient services are comprised of a structured program providing care three days per week for three hours per day at a minimum. Designed as a “step down” from partial hospitalization, this program reinforces progress and assists in the attainment of sobriety, reduction of detrimental behaviors and improved overall wellness of clients while they integrate and interact in the community. Services include weekly individual therapy, group therapy, family education and therapy, didactic and psycho-educational groups, case management, off-site recovery meetings and activities and intensive transitional and aftercare planning.
 Outpatient Services. Traditional outpatient services are delivered in regularly scheduled sessions, usually less the nine hours per week. Outpatient services include professionally directed screening, assessment, therapy, and other services designed to support successful transition to the community and long-term recovery. These services are tailored to a person’s specific needs and stage of recovery and may involve many modalities, including motivational enhancement, family therapy, educational groups, occupational and recreational therapy, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. 
 Ancillary Services. In addition to our inpatient and outpatient treatment services, we provide medical monitoring for adherence to addiction treatment as well as clinical diagnostic laboratory services. We also provide physician services to our clients through our contracted professional physician groups. We believe toxicological monitoring of clients is an important component of substance abuse treatment. Clients are evaluated for illicit substances upon admission and thereafter on a random basis and as otherwise determined to be medically necessary by the treating physician. We conduct laboratory testing for our facilities using quantitative liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology at our laboratory located in Brentwood, Tennessee.
 Sober Living Facilities. We provide sober living arrangements that serve as an interim environment for clients transitioning from inpatient treatment centers to lower levels of care and eventually back to their former living arrangements. Sober living facilities enable us to utilize existing beds for clients requiring higher levels of care, while still providing housing for clients completing outpatient treatment programs. We provide sober living arrangements to clients through our owned and leased properties in Texas, Nevada, Mississippi, and Florida. We plan to continue using sober living facilities as a complement to our outpatient services.

Sales and Marketing
 We use a multi-faceted approach to reach potential clients suffering from the disease of addiction and co-occurring psychiatric disorders.
 This multi-pronged approach includes:
  
• | National Marketing Force. We deploy and manage a group of approximately 100 representatives nationwide that focuses primarily on developing relationships with hospitals, other treatment facilities, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers, employers, unions, alumni and employee assistance programs. Our sales representatives educate these various

constituents about the disease of addiction and the variety of treatment services that we provide. In addition, our varied facilities located across the United States allow us to reach a broad audience of potential clients and their families and build a nationally recognized brand.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-Media Marketing. Advertising through various media represents another important opportunity to obtain new clients as well as to develop our national brand. We operate a broad portfolio of internet assets that service millions of website visits each month. Through comprehensive online directories of treatment providers, treatment provider reviews, user content that discusses the disease of addiction, treatment and recovery, as well as discussion forums and professional communities, our addiction-related websites serve families and individuals who are struggling with addiction and seeking treatment options. Additionally, we continue to pursue advertising opportunities in television commercials, radio spots, newspaper articles, medical journals and other print media that promote our facilities and have the intent to build our integrated, national brand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recommendations by Alumni. We often receive new clients who were directly referred to our facilities by our satisfied and supportive alumni, as well as their friends and families. As our national brand continues to grow and our business continues to increase, we believe our alumni will become an increasingly important source of business for us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admissions Center Operations
 We maintain a 24 hours per day, seven days per week admissions center. Our centralized admissions center is situated at our corporate headquarters in Brentwood, Tennessee, and focuses on enrolling clients. As part of its role, the admissions center team conducts benefits verification, handles initial communication with insurance companies, completes client intake screenings, consults with our clinicians where necessary regarding a potential patient’s specific medical or psychological condition, begins the pre-certification process for treatment authorization, helps each client choose a proper treatment facility for his or her clinical and financial needs and assists clients with arrangements and logistics.
Professional Groups
 We are affiliated with groups of physicians and mid-level service providers that provide certain professional services to our clients through professional services agreements with certain of our treatment facilities (the “Professional Groups”). Under the professional services agreements, the Professional Groups also provide a physician to serve as medical director for the applicable facility. The Professional Groups either bill the payor for their services directly or are compensated by the treatment facility based on fair market value hourly rates. Each of the professional services agreements has a term of five years and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods. For additional information related to the Professional Groups, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 We believe we are one of the leading for-profit companies focused on substance abuse treatment in the United States. According to IBISWorld, the large majority of all substance abuse treatment clinics in the United States have a single location, and approximately 60% of all substance abuse treatment clinics have fewer than 20 employees. Many of the largest for-profit addiction treatment providers operate in the broader behavioral healthcare sector without focusing primarily on substance abuse. We believe our size and core focus on substance abuse treatment provide us with an advantage over competitors in terms of building our brand and marketing our platform to potential clients.
 The market for mental health and substance abuse treatment facilities is highly fragmented with approximately 12,000 different companies providing services to the adult and adolescent population, of which only 30% are operated by for-profit organizations. Our inpatient treatment facilities compete with several national competitors and many regional and local competitors. Some of our competitors are government entities that are supported by tax revenue, and others are non-profit entities that are primarily supported by endowments and charitable contributions. We do not receive financial support from these sources. Some larger companies in our industry compete with us on a national scale and offer substance use treatment services among other behavioral healthcare services. To a lesser extent, we also compete with other providers of substance use treatment services, including other inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities and general acute care hospitals.
 We believe the primary competitive factors affecting our business include:
  
• | quality of clinical programs and services;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | reputation and brand recognition;
--+----------------------------------


• | overall aesthetics of the facilities;
--+--------------------------------------


• | amenities offered to clients;

Regulatory Matters
 Overview
 Substance abuse treatment providers are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. In order to operate our business and obtain reimbursement from third-party payors, we must obtain and maintain a variety of licenses, permits, certifications and accreditations. We must also comply with numerous other laws and regulations applicable to the provision of substance abuse disorder services. Our facilities are also subject to periodic on-site inspections by the regulatory and accreditation agencies in order to determine our compliance with applicable requirements.
 The laws and regulations that affect substance abuse treatment providers are complex and change frequently. We must regularly review our organization and operations and make changes as necessary to comply with changes in the law or new interpretations of laws or regulations. In recent years, significant public attention has focused on the healthcare industry, including attention to the conduct of industry participants and the cost of healthcare services. Federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts relating to the healthcare industry. The ongoing investigations relate to, among other things, referral practices, cost reporting, billing practices, credit balances, physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals and other healthcare providers. Recently, federal and state governmental officials have focused on fraud and abuse in the addiction treatment industry. In particular, new laws and regulations have been passed in recent years that are intended to prohibit the payment of kickbacks, bribes and other inducements in exchange for referrals of patients to treatment providers, including residential treatment centers and outpatient programs. We expect that healthcare costs and other factors will continue to encourage both the development of new laws and regulations and increased enforcement activity, including among substance abuse treatment providers. 
 While we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any material pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of wrongdoing, there can be no assurances of compliance. Compliance with such laws and regulations may be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties and exclusion from government health programs.
 Licensure, Accreditation and Certification
 All of our substance abuse treatment facilities are licensed under applicable state laws where licensure is required. Licensing requirements vary significantly depending upon the state in which a facility is located and the types of services provided. The types of licensed services that our facilities provide include medical detox, inpatient, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient treatment, ambulatory detox and community housing. In addition, our employed case managers, therapists, nurses, medical providers and technicians may be subject to individual state license requirements.
 Our facilities that store and dispense controlled substances are required to register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and abide by DEA regulations regarding controlled substances. Each of our substance abuse treatment facilities has obtained or is in the process of obtaining accreditation from CARF and/or The Joint Commission, which are the primary accreditation bodies in the substance abuse treatment industry. This type of accreditation program is intended to improve the quality, safety, outcomes and value of healthcare services provided by accredited facilities. CARF and The Joint Commission require an initial application and completion of on-site surveys demonstrating compliance with accreditation requirements. Accreditation is granted for a specified period, typically ranging from one to three years, and renewals of accreditation require completion of a renewal application and an on-site renewal survey. 
 The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical, operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the level of complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory. A CLIA certificate of waiver is maintained by each of our treatment facilities that only perform the types of tests waived under CLIA, such as point-of-care drug analysis, glucose monitoring and pregnancy testing.
 Our Brentwood, Tennessee, clinical laboratory facility performs high complexity testing. Our laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of accreditation, certifying it for complex testing, and is therefore required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex testing. We are regularly subject to survey and inspection to assess compliance with program standards. Our laboratory is also accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), who conducts our proficiency testing program. 
 CLIA does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law. State laws may require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency testing. A number of states in which we operate have implemented their own regulatory and licensure requirements. In addition, some states require laboratories that solicit or test samples collected from individuals within that state to hold a laboratory license even though the laboratory does not have physical operations within the state. Our Brentwood laboratory facility is licensed as a medical reference laboratory by the state of Tennessee. It is also 
 10


licensed in other states as required to process test samples originating from individuals within such states. 
 We believe that all of our facilities and programs are in substantial compliance with current applicable state and local licensure, certification and accreditation requirements. Periodically, state and local regulatory agencies, as well as accreditation entities, conduct surveys of our facilities, and may find that a facility is not in full compliance with all of the accreditation standards. Upon receipt of any such finding, the facility will submit a plan of correction and remedy any cited deficiencies.
 FDA Laws and Regulations
 The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing. A number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs but exercises enforcement discretion in not mandating FDA approval for most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA certified laboratories. The FDA released draft guidance in 2014 that would increase regulation of LDTs but has indefinitely delayed finalizing the guidance.
 Fraud, Abuse and Self-Referral Laws
 Most of our treatment facilities are not enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid and do not bill or accept payments from those governmental programs. Therefore, the majority of our operations are generally not impacted by the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the Anti-Kickback Statute, or the federal prohibition on physician self-referrals, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. However, our AdCare operations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and during 2018 our clinical laboratory became eligible to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. We expect that over the longer term, an increasing number of our patients will be members of governmental health insurance programs and therefore, these rules and restrictions will increasingly affect our operations. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the payment, receipt, offer or solicitation of remuneration of any kind in exchange for items or services that are reimbursed under federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare providers that furnish certain designated health services, including laboratory services and inpatient and outpatient hospital services, if the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership interests in, or other financial arrangements with, the healthcare providers. Many states have anti-kickback and physician self-referral prohibitions similar to the federal statutes and regulations. Some of these state laws are drafted broadly to cover all payors (i.e., not restricted to Medicare and other federal healthcare programs), and they often lack interpretative guidance. A violation of these laws could result in a prohibition on billing payors for such services, an obligation to refund amounts received, or civil or criminal penalties and could adversely affect the state license of any program or facility found to be in violation.
 In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the United States has recently enacted an addiction treatment-specific law known as the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (“EKRA”).  The EKRA created a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (1) soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) paying or offering any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Each conviction under EKRA is punishable by up to $200,000 in monetary damages, imprisonment for up to ten (10) years, or both.  Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statutes, EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government healthcare program. While EKRA contains certain exceptions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors, those exceptions are more narrow than the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors.  As such, certain practices that would not have violated the Anti-Kickback Statute may violate EKRA.
 Federal prosecutors have broad authority to prosecute healthcare fraud. For example, federal law criminalizes the knowing and willful execution or attempted execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program as well as obtaining by false pretenses any money or property owned by any healthcare benefit program. Federal law also prohibits embezzlement of healthcare funds, false statements relating to healthcare and obstruction of the investigation of criminal offenses. These federal criminal offenses are enforceable regardless of whether an entity or individual participates in the Medicare program or any other federal healthcare program.
 False Claims
 We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. These laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly and willfully presenting a claim (or causing a claim to be presented) for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that is false or fraudulent. The standard for “knowing and willful” often includes conduct that amounts to a reckless disregard for whether accurate information is presented by claims processors. Penalties under these statutes include substantial civil and criminal fines, exclusion from the Medicare program and imprisonment.
 One of the most prominent of these laws is the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff (or whistleblower) on the government’s behalf. When a private plaintiff brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant often will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene. When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the amount of the alleged false claim, plus mandatory civil penalties of between 
 11


$22,363 and $11,181 for each separate false claim. These and certain other civil monetary penalties will increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index.
 Many states have passed false claims acts similar to the FCA. Under these laws, the government may impose a penalty and recover damages, often treble damages, for knowingly submitting or participating in the submission of claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or which contain false or misleading information. These laws may be limited to specific programs (such as state workers’ compensation programs) or may apply to all payors. In many cases, alleged violations of these laws may be brought by a whistleblower who may be an employee, a referring physician, a competitor, a client or other individual or entity, and who may be eligible for a portion of any recovery. Further, like the federal law, state false claims act laws generally protect employed whistleblowers from retribution by their employers.
 Although we believe that we have procedures in place to ensure the accurate completion of claims forms and requests for payment, the laws, regulations and standards defining proper billing, coding and claim submission are complex and have not been subjected to extensive judicial or agency interpretation. Billing errors can occur despite our best efforts to prevent or correct them, and we cannot assure that the government or a payor will regard such errors as inadvertent and not in violation of the applicable false claims act laws or related statutes.
 Privacy and Security Requirements
 There are numerous federal and state regulations that address the privacy and security of client health information. In particular, federal regulations issued under the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1979 (known as the “Part 2 Regulations”) restrict the disclosure of, and regulate the security of, client identifiable information related to substance abuse and apply to any of our facilities that receive federal assistance, which is interpreted broadly to include facilities licensed, certified or registered by a federal agency. Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), extensively regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (known as “protected health information”) and requires covered entities, which include most health providers, to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic protected health information. These regulations also provide clients with substantive rights with respect to their health information.
 The HIPAA privacy and security regulations and the Part 2 Regulations also require our substance abuse treatment programs and facilities to impose compliance obligations by written agreement on certain contractors to whom our programs disclose client information known as “business associates.” Covered entities may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA privacy and security regulations if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In instances where our programs act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond the program’s covered entity status.
 Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information without regard to whether there is a low probability of the information being compromised.
 After considering 2018 updates to penalty amounts, violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil penalties of up to $57,051 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1,711,533 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. These penalties will increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. In addition, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect and to perform compliance audits.
 Our programs remain subject to any privacy-related federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. These laws vary by state and could impose additional requirements and penalties. For example, some states impose restrictions on the use and disclosure of health information pertaining to mental health or substance abuse treatment. The Federal Trade Commission also uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches or other privacy or security lapses.
 We enforce a health information privacy and security compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and other applicable requirements. We may be required to make operational changes to comply with revisions made to the Part 2 Regulations that generally became effective on February 2, 2018.

Mental Health Legislation and Reform Efforts
 The regulatory framework in which we operate is constantly changing. For example, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (“MHPAEA”), is a federal parity law that requires large group health insurance plans that offer mental health and addiction coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial requirements and treatment limitations of coverage offered for other illnesses. The scope of coverage offered by health plans must comply with federal and state laws and must be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice. The MHPAEA also contains a cost exemption that operates to temporarily exempt a group health plan from the MHPAEA’s requirements if compliance with the MHPAEA becomes too costly. 
 The 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), enacted in 2016, requires development of an action plan for enhanced enforcement of mental health parity requirements and additional compliance guidance for health plans regarding coverage under parity laws. Among other initiatives aimed at improving care for people with mental health and substance use disorders, the Cures Act includes provisions intended to increase the healthcare workforce dedicated to such treatment and expand programs that divert people with mental health and substance use disorders toward alternatives to incarceration. However, the impact of the Cures Act largely depends on its implementation by agencies such as HHS and on future appropriations by Congress.
 Over the last decade, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws intended to result in extensive change to the healthcare industry. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, is the most prominent of these legislative reform efforts. It resulted in reforms to the health insurance market and expansion of public program coverage, among other changes. As currently structured, the law requires all non-grandfathered small group and individual market health plans to cover ten essential health benefit categories, which currently include substance abuse addiction and mental health disorder services. 
 The Affordable Care Act poses both opportunities and risks for us but, overall, the expansion of health insurance coverage under the law has been beneficial for the substance abuse treatment industry. However, the overall and continued impact of the Affordable Care Act is difficult to determine, as the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation and its interpretation. For example, in October 2017, the president signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially allowing for fewer plans that adhere to specific Affordable Care Act coverage mandates. In 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act, in its entirety, is invalid. That decision has been stayed pending appeal, and will likely remain unresolved until finally decided by the United States Supreme Court. Further, effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate that was established by the Affordable Care Act.
 Addiction Treatment Legislation
 In October 2018, Congress enacted the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”). The SUPPORT Act contains a number of provisions aimed at identifying at-risk individuals, increasing access to opioid abuse treatment, reducing overprescribing, funding treatment related research, and promoting data sharing with the primary goal of reducing the use and abuse of opioids.  Most of the funding made available for treatment through the SUPPORT Act will be limited to patients covered by federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid.  
 The SUPPORT Act also contains an addiction treatment-specific law known as the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (“EKRA”).  For more information on the EKRA, See “Item I. Business, Regulatory Matters ―Fraud, Abuse and Self-Referral Laws.”
 Health Planning and Certificates of Need
 The construction of new healthcare facilities, the expansion, transfer or change of ownership of existing facilities and the addition of new beds, services or equipment may be subject to state laws that require prior approval by state regulatory agencies under certificate of need (“CON”) or determination of need (“DON”) laws. These laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need for construction or acquisition of facilities or the addition of new services. Review of CON or DON applications and other healthcare planning initiatives may be lengthy and may require public hearings. Violations of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or revocation of a facility’s license. 
Other State Healthcare Laws
 Most states have a variety of laws that may potentially impact our operations and business practices. For instance, many states in which our programs operate prohibit corporations (and other legal entities) from practicing medicine by employing physicians and certain non-physician practitioners. These prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine impact how our programs structure their relationships with physicians and other affected non-physician practitioners. These arrangements, however, have typically not been vetted by either a court or the applicable regulatory body.
 Similarly, many states prohibit physicians from sharing a portion of their professional fees with any other person or entity. These so-called fee-splitting prohibitions range from prohibiting arrangements resembling a kickback to broadly prohibiting percentage-based compensation and other variable compensation arrangements with physicians.
 If our arrangements with physicians are found to violate a corporate practice of medicine prohibition or a state fee-splitting prohibition, our contractual arrangements with physicians in such states could be adversely affected, which, in turn, may adversely 
 13


affect both our operations and profitability. Further, we could face sanctions for aiding and abetting the violation of the state’s medical practice act.
 State governments have in recent years increased regulation of addiction treatment providers.  A number of states, such as Florida, have passed laws prohibiting patient brokering, which broadly refers to the practice of paying or receiving kickbacks or other benefits in exchange for patient referrals.  A number of these statutes mirror federal healthcare anti-Kickback laws and, in some instances, the restrictions apply regardless of whether the payor source is a governmental or commercial entity. Further, state governments, including Tennessee’s, have passed statutes aimed at prohibiting deceptive online addiction treatment marketing practices, such as the operation of websites and affiliated admission centers without disclosure to the caller about existing financial arrangements to promote particular treatment centers. We expect that these kinds of regulations and restrictions to increase.
 Local Land Use and Zoning
 Municipal and other local governments may also regulate our treatment programs. Many of our facilities must comply with zoning and land use requirements in order to operate. For example, local zoning authorities regulate not only the physical properties of a healthcare facility, such as its height and size, but also the location and activities of the facility. In addition, community or political objections to the placement of treatment facilities can result in delays in the land use permit process and may prevent the operation of facilities in certain areas.
Risk Management and Insurance
 The healthcare industry in general continues to experience an increase in the frequency and severity of litigation and claims. Like other providers of healthcare-related services, we could be subject to claims that our services have resulted in injury to our clients or had other adverse effects. In addition, resident, visitor and employee injuries could also subject us to the risk of litigation. While we believe that quality care is provided to our clients and that we substantially comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, an adverse determination in a legal proceeding or government investigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — “As a provider of treatment services, we are subject to governmental investigations and potential claims and legal actions by clients, employees and others, which may increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and reputation.”
  We maintain commercial insurance coverage for general liability claims with a $50,000 deductible and professional liability claims with a $150,000 deductible, a primary $1.0 million per claim limit and an annual aggregate primary limit of $3.0 million with umbrella coverage for an aggregate $20.0 million limit.
 Compliance Programs
 Compliance with government rules and regulations is a significant concern throughout our industry, in part due to evolving interpretations of these rules and regulations. We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations. To this end, we have established a compliance program that monitors our regulatory compliance procedures and policies at our facilities and throughout our business. Our executive management team is responsible for the oversight and operation of our compliance program. We provide periodic and comprehensive training programs to our personnel, which are intended to promote the strict observance of our policies designed to ensure compliance with the statutes and regulations applicable to us.
 On October 21, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries, AAC (formerly known as Forterus, Inc.), Forterus Health Care Services, Inc., and ABTTC, Inc. (the “Defendants”), agreed to the entry of a Permanent Injunction and Final Judgment (the “PIFJ”) with the Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California (“BMFEA”). Pursuant to the terms of the PIFJ, we were required to, among other things, (i) institute a three-year compliance program (the “California Compliance Program”) with respect to our California facilities that includes maintaining or developing and implementing certain policies and procedures to promote each covered facility’s compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and the PIFJ, under the responsibility of our Chief Compliance Officer; (ii) establish a Compliance Committee composed of the Compliance Officer and senior personnel responsible for overseeing clinical operations to address issues raised by the Compliance Officer in connection with the Compliance Program and (iii) establish an oversight committee of the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of Directors, to review the adequacy and responsiveness of the California Compliance Program. In addition, for a period of 30 months following the effective date of the PIFJ, the Defendants are required to retain a qualified independent monitor, appointed by BMFEA after consultation with the Defendants, to assess the effectiveness of the Defendants’ quality control systems and patient care.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that: (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical and pharmaceutical waste products generated at our facilities, the presence of other hazardous substances in the indoor environment and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with the development or construction of our facilities; (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and (iii) regulate workplace safety, including the safety of workers who may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, the hepatitis B virus and the hepatitis C virus. Our laboratory and some of our 
 14


treatment facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of our clients and in connection with performing laboratory tests. The management of infectious medical waste is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws that establish management requirements for such waste. These requirements include record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Management believes that our operations are generally in compliance with environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements or that any non-compliance will not result in a material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations at our facilities, including our laboratory, have not been material. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — “We could face risks associated with, or arising out of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.” 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,900 people. Employees at the Sunrise House facility in New Jersey are part of a labor union. As a result of our Sunrise House facility entering into a three-year collective bargaining agreement with the union on June 14, 2017, a majority of our employees at Sunrise House are now represented by a collective bargaining agreement. None of our other employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good.
