ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background Prior to the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement
 
Boreal Productions Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 24, 2007. Andrea Fehsenfeld was then appointed sole officer and director. The Company was formed to option feature films and TV projects and then package them to sell at a profit to various studios and production companies.
 
At that time the board of directors voted to seek capital and begin development of our business plan. We received our initial funding of $9,000 through the sale of common stock to Ms. Fehsenfeld who purchased 3,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.003 per share and $45,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 shares of common stock issued to 30 un-affiliated investors at $0.015 per share. On June 11, 2008, we effected a five for one forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 375,000,000 shares of common stock and our outstanding share capital increased from 6,000,000 shares of common stock to 30,000,000 shares of common stock.
 
We have not achieved revenues and have accrued a Net Loss of $153,964 since inception through May 6, 2015, the date of the reverse merger. We have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditors and rely upon the sale of our securities to fund operations. To date we have been unable to raise sufficient capital to finance the production of any film or television production and, consequently, our management has sought alternative strategies, such as business combinations or acquisitions, to create value for our shareholders.
 
On April 13, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement with DSG TAG and the shareholders of DSG TAG who become parties to the share exchange agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire not less than 75% and up to 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of DSG TAG’s common stock in exchange for the issuance by our company of up to 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of DSG TAG on the basis of one of our common shares for 5.4935 common shares of DSG TAG.
 
Previously, in anticipation of the share exchange agreement with DSG TAG, we undertook to change our name and effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued common stock. Accordingly, on January 19, 2015, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary DSG Global Inc., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Boreal Productions Inc. to DSG Global Inc. Our company remains the surviving company. DSG Global Inc. was formed solely for the change of name.
 
Also on January 19, 2015, our company’s board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a three (3) old for one (1) new basis. Upon effect of the reverse split, our authorized capital will decrease from 375,000,000 shares of common stock to 125,000,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock will decrease from 30,000,000 to 10,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.

Articles of Merger to effect the merger and change of name and a Certificate of Change to effect the reverse stock split were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 22, 2015, with an effective date of February 2, 2015. The name change and forward split were reviewed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) were approved for filing with an effective date of February 23, 2015.
 
The name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and OTC Markets quotation system at the opening of trading on February 23, 2015 under the symbol “BRPOD”. Effective March 19, 2015 our stock symbol changed to “DSGT”. Our new CUSIP number following the symbol change is 23340C104. The first trade of our common shares occurred on March 25, 2015.
 
On May 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of approximately 75% (82,435,748 common shares) of the issued and outstanding common shares of DSG TAG Systems as contemplated by the share exchange agreement by issuing 15,185,875 shares of our common stock to shareholders of DSG TAG Systems who became parties to the agreement. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued an additional 179,823 shares of our common stock to Westergaard Holdings Ltd. in partial settlement of accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness of DSG TAG Systems.
 
Following the initial closing of the share exchange agreement and through October 22, 2015, we acquired an additional 101,200 shares of common stock of DSG TAG Systems from shareholders who became parties to the share exchange agreement, and issued to these shareholders an aggregate of 18,422 shares of our common stock. Following completion of these additional purchases, DSG Global owns approximately 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of DSG TAG Systems. An aggregate of 4,229,384 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of DSG TAG Systems continues to be held by Westergaard Holdings Ltd., an affiliate of Keith Westergaard, a member of our board of directors.
 
The reverse acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein DSG TAG Systems is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. We adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG Systems upon the closing of the share exchange agreement.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 214 - 5455 152nd Street, Surrey, BC, V3S 5A5 Canada. The telephone number at our principal executive office is 1 (877) 589 - 8806.
 
Business Subsequent to the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement
 
Subsequent to the closing of the share exchange agreement with DSG Tag Systems, Inc. (“DSG TAG”), we have adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG.
 
DSG TAG was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 17, 2008 and extra provincially registered in British Columbia, Canada in 2008. In March 2011, DSG TAG formed DSG Tag Systems International, Ltd. in the United Kingdom (“DSG UK”). DSG UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of DSG TAG.
 
When used the terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “DSG,” or “DSG TAG,” means DSG Global, Inc. and its subsidiary DSG Tag Systems, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary DSG Tag Systems International, Ltd.
 
DSG Global Inc. (“DSG”) is a technology development company based in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of fleet management solutions for the golf industry, as well as commercial, government and military applications.

The company specializes in the vehicle fleet management industry. DSG stands for “Digital Security Guard” which is the company’s primary value statement giving fleet operator’s new capabilities to track and control their vehicles. The company has developed a proprietary combination of hardware and software that is marketed around the world as the TAG System. The company has primarily focused on the golf industry where the TAG System is deployed to help golf course operators manage their fleet of golf carts, turf equipment, and utility vehicles. DSG is now a leader in the category of Fleet Management in the golf industry and was awarded “Best Technology of the Year” by Boardroom magazine the publication of the National Golf Course Owners Association in 2010. To date the TAG is installed on over 8,000 vehicles and the company has monitored over 6,000,000 rounds.
 
The TAG system fills a void in the marketplace by offering a modular structure which allows the customer to customize their system depending on desired functionality and budget constraints. In addition to the core TAG vehicle control functionality which can operate independently, DSG has two golfer information display systems; the alphanumeric TEXT and high definition TOUCH providing the operator two options which is unique in the industry.
 
The market for the TAG System is the 40,000 golf operations worldwide. While the golf industry is still the primary sales and marketing focus, the company has completed several successful pilots of the TAG in other vertical markets such as agriculture, and commercial fleet deployments. With appropriate resources in place the company will implement a sales and marketing strategy expanding into these markets.
 
We have a direct sales force in North America, which comprises the most significant portion of the golf fleet market, and have developed key relationships with distributors and golf equipment manufacturers such as E-Z-GO, Yamaha and Ransomes Jacobsen to help drive sales for the North American and worldwide markets.

DSG Technologies and Products
 
Technology Overview
 
DSG produces a “modular” suite of products to provide fleet management solution for any vehicle required for a golf operation, and provides two golfer information display options to meet the operators budget requirements. DSG believes that it is currently the only company in the golf fleet management industry with these capabilities.
 
The DSG TAG System is designed from the ground up to be a golf/turf vehicle fleet management system. Its main function is addressing the golf course operator needs. While employing same core technology (cellular wireless and GPS) as traditional commercial vehicle fleet management systems, DSG has created patent pending solutions to adapt it to the very specific requirements of the golf environment. Compared to mainstream fleet tracking products, DSG collects 10 to 50 times more data points per MB (megabyte) of cellular data due to its proprietary data collection and compression algorithms. Also the relative positioning accuracy is improved by almost one order of magnitude by the use of application-specific geo-data validation and correction methods.
 
DSG’s proprietary methods make it possible to offer a solution suitable for use on golf courses at a price low enough to be affordable in the industry. Every system component incorporates state-of-the-art technology (server, mobile trackers, display). In developing its products DSG TAG Systems has adopted an application oriented approach placing the most emphasis (and research & development) on server and end-user software by taking advantage of the commodity level reached by mainstream technologies such as Global Positioning (GPS) and M2M (Machine to Machine) Cellular Data in the wider context of Commercial Fleet Management.
 
DSG leveraged the existence of an abundance of very cost effective telematics solutions by selecting an “off-the-shelf” hardware platform that meets all the main performance and environmental requirements for operation in the harsh, outdoor golf course environment. While removing all risk and cost associated with developing a proprietary hardware platform, DSG has maintained the unique nature of its hardware solution by developing a set of proprietary adapters and interfaces specifically for the golf application.
 
DSG has secured an exclusive supply agreement with the third-party hardware manufacturers for the vertical of golf industry. Additionally, DSG owns the design of all proprietary adapters and interfaces. This removes the risk of a potential competitor utilizing the same hardware platform. Competitors could attempt to reverse engineer or copycat the TAG technology and equipment. This risk factor is mitigated by the fact that our product does not rely on a particular technology or hardware platform to be successful but on a very specific vertical software application that is far more difficult to copy (and respectively easier to protect).
 
The application software contains patent features implemented in every core component of the system. The TAG device runs DSG proprietary firmware incorporating unique data collection and compression algorithms. The web server software which powers the end-user application is also proprietary and incorporates the industry knowledge accumulated through the over 70 years of collective experience of the DSG team.
 
This approach has given the product line a high level of endurance against technology obsolescence. At any point in time, if a hardware component is discontinued or a better/less expensive hardware platform becomes available, the software application can be easily adapted to operate on the new platform or with the new component. The company benefits from the constant increase of performance and cost reduction of mainstream hardware technology without any additional cost.
 
The web-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model used by DSG TAG System is optimal for low operating and support costs and rapid-cycle release for software updates. It is also a major factor in eliminating or substantially reducing the need for any end-user premises equipment. Customers have access to the service through any internet connected computer or mobile device, there is no need for a local wireless network on the facility and installation time and cost are minimal.

DSG is positioned to take advantage of mainstream technology and utilize “best of breed” hardware platforms to create new generations of products. Our software is designed to be “portable” to future new platforms with better GPS and wireless technology in order to maintain the Company competitive edge.
 
All new product development effort of DSG is following the same model: select the best of breed third-party hardware platform, design and produce custom proprietary accessories while focusing the bulk of the development efforts on vertical software application to address a very specific set of end-customer needs.
 
The latest addition to the TAG family of products, the TAG TOUCH is a perfect example of this development philosophy in action: the main component is a last-generation Android tablet PC wrapped in a custom designed outdoor enclosure containing the power supply and interface components required for the golf environment. The software application is taking advantage of all the advanced high resolution graphics, touch user interface and computing power of the Android OS delivering a vastly superior user experience compared to competitive systems. The time to market for this product was 30% of how long it took to develop and launch this type of products in the past.
 
The TAG Control Unit
 
The company’s flagship product is the TAG Control unit. The TAG can operate as a “stand alone” unit or with one of two displays; the TEXT alphanumeric display or the TOUCH high definition “touch activated” screen. The TAG is GPS enabled and communicates with the TAG software using cellular GSM networks. Utilizing the cellular networks rather than erecting a local Wi-Fi network assures carrier grade uptime, and vehicle tracking “off- property”. GSM is the de facto global standard for mobile communications.
 
The TAG unit itself is discreetly installed usually in the nose of the vehicle to give the GPS clear line of site. It is then connected to the vehicle battery and ignition. The property is then mapped using the latest satellite imagery that is graphically enhanced and loaded into the TAG System as a map.
 
Once installed the vehicle owner utilizes the TAG software to locate the vehicle in real time using any computer, smartphone, or tablet that has an internet connection and perform various management operations.
 

The operator can use the geo-fencing capabilities to create “zones” on the property where they can control the vehicles behavior such as shutting down a vehicle that is entering a sensitive or dangerous area. The TAG System also monitors the strength of the vehicle’s battery helping to prevent sending out vehicles undercharged batteries which can be an inconvenience for the course and negatively impact the golfer experience.

The R3 model is more effective than the previous advertising model of ‘One to One’, these are local ads only sold through direct sales by courses, or 3rd party advertising sales firms. The new R3 model offers ‘Many to one’ advertising options, delivering thousands of national, regional, and local advertisers an opportunity to advertise on our screens through our R3 Marketplace.
 

Previous ‘One to One’ model vs the new R3 model ‘Many to One’
 

TAG TURF/ECO TAG
 
The TAG Turf and the new ECO TAG were developed to give course operators the same back end management features for their turf equipment and utility vehicles. Turf equipment is expensive and a single piece can run over $100,000 and represents a large portion of a golf course operating budget. The TAG Turf and ECO TAG have comprehensive reporting that the operator can utilize to implement programs that can increase efficiencies, reduce labor costs, help lower idle times, provide fuel consumption and equipment performance, provide historical data on cutting patterns, and reduce pollution from emissions by monitoring idle times. Since the golf course needs to be maintained regardless of volume these cost saving measures directly impact the operator’s bottom line.

Revenue Model
 
DSG derives revenue from four different sources.
 
Systems Sales Revenue, which consists of the sales price paid by those customers who purchase our TAG system hardware.
 

14
--


Monthly Service Fees are paid by all customers for the wireless data fee charges required to operate the GPS tracking on the TAG systems.
 
Monthly Rental Fees are paid by those customers that rent the TAG system hardware. The amount of a customer’s monthly payment varies based on the type of equipment rented (a TAG, a TAG and TEXT, or a TAG and TOUCH).
 
Advertising Revenue is a source of revenue that has not been taken full advantage of. We believe it has the potential to be strategic for us in the future. Currently, courses can deliver their own advertising to our TOUCH units and soon we’ll be introducing our R3 program which automates the delivery of advertising.
 
Markets
 
Sales and Marketing Plan
 
The market for the TAG System is the worldwide golf cart and Turf equipment fleets. There are 40,000 golf courses around the world with North America being the largest individual market with 20,000. This represents over 3,000,000 vehicles. The golf market has five distinct types of operations. Municipal, Private Country Clubs, Destination Resorts, Public Commercial, Military and University affiliated. DSG has deployed and has case studies developed TAG systems in each of these categories.
 
Our marketing strategy is focused on building brand awareness, generating quality leads, and providing excellent customer service.
 
North America Sales
 
Since the largest market is North America the company employs a direct sales team and Sales Agents that provides full sales coverage. Our Sales Agents are experienced golf industry professionals who maintain established relationships with the golf industry and carry multiple golf lines. Our sales objective is to offer our existing and prospective customers a dedicated, knowledgeable, and outstanding customer service team.

We utilize strategic distributor partnerships in each targeted region/country to sell, install and service our products. Distributors are selected based on market strength, market share, technical and selling capability, and overall reputation. We believe that DSG solutions appeal to all distributors because they are universal and fit any make or model of vehicle. We maintain and leverage our strong relationship with Yamaha, E-Z-GO and Ransomes Jacobsen (sister company to E-Z-GO) in developing our distributor network around the world. Today, many of our distributor partners are the leading distributors for E-Z-GO and RJ and hold a dominant position in their respective markets. While they are Yamaha or E-Z-GO distributors, most sell DSG products to all courses regardless of their choice of golf car as a value add to their customers and to generate additional revenue. We complement this distributor base with independent distributors as needed to ensure we have sufficient coverage in critical markets.
 
Currently DSG is focused on Europe, Asia and South Africa. The company is looking to expand next into Australia and Latin America.
 
Management Companies
 
Many golf facilities are managed by management companies. The portfolios of these companies vary from a few to hundreds of golf courses. Troon®, the world’s largest player in golf course management, has over 200 courses under management. The management companies provide everything from branding, staffing, management systems, marketing, and procurement. DSG is currently providing products and services to Troon, OB Sports, Kemper Sports, Trump, Marriott Golf, Blue Green, Crown Golf, American Golf, Billy Casper, Club Corp, and Club Link.
 
DSG has been successful in completing installations and developing relationships with several of the key players who control a substantial number of courses. DSG will continue to implement system developments that are driven by the needs of these management companies such as combined reporting, multiple course access through a centralized dashboard. This development will become a competitive advantage for DSG in the management company market.
 
DSG has dedicated a team to create specific collateral for this market and has assigned a senior executive to have direct responsibility to manage these relationships.
 
Competition
 
We compete with a number of established producers and distributors of vehicle fleet management systems. Our competitors include producers of golf specific applications, such as GPS Industries, LLC., one of the leading suppliers of golf cart fleet management systems, as well as producers of non-golf specific utility vehicle fleet management systems, such as Toro. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. In order for us to successfully compete in our industry we must:

● | demonstrate our products’ competitive advantages; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a comprehensive marketing system; and 
● | increase our financial resources. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
 
We believe that we will be able to compete effectively in our industry because of the versatility, reliability, and relative affordability of our products when compared to those of our competitors. We will attempt to build awareness of our competitive advantages among existing and potential customers through trade shows, sales visits and demonstrations, online marketing, and positive word of mouth advertising.
 
However, as we are newly-established company relative to our competitors, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as limited access to capital. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of research, operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.

Our primary competitor in the field of golf course fleet management is GPS Industries, a company that was founded in 1996 by Mr. Bob Silzer, the founder of DSG TAG Systems. GPS Industries is currently the largest player in the marketplace with an installed base of approximately 750 golf courses worldwide. GPS Industries was consolidated by various mergers and acquisitions with a diversity of hardware platforms and application software. Since 2009, when GPS Industries has introduced their latest product offering called the Visage, in an exclusive partnership with Club Car, their strategy has been to target mostly their existing customers and motivate them into replacing their existing, older GPS system, with the Visage system.
 
GPS Industries is leveraging very heavily their partnership with Club Car, which is one of the three largest golf cars manufacturers in the world and at times is benefiting from golf operators’ preference for Club Car and their vehicles when they select their management system.
 
Market Mix
 
Since the introduction of the DSG product line, the golf course operators realized that they have now access to a budget-friendly fleet management tool that works not only on golf cars but also with all other vehicles used on the golf course such as turf maintenance, shuttles, and other utility vehicles.
 
Marketing studies have identified that half of the golf course operators only need a fleet management system and only 15% need a high-end GPS golf system. This illustrates the strong competitive advantage that DSG TAG Systems has versus GPS Industries since their product can only address the needs of a relatively small fraction of the marketplace.
 
Consequently, GPS Industries installed base has steadily declined since most of their new product installations have replaced older product for existing customers and some customers have opted for a lower budget system and switched over to DSG TAG Systems.
 
Marketing Activities
 
The company has a multi layered approach marketing the TAG suite of products. One of the foundations of this plan is attending industry trade shows which are well attended by golf operators. The two largest shows are the PGA Merchandise Show and the Golf Industry Show which are held in Florida at the end of January. The company also attends a number of regional shows around North America. International events are attended by our distributors and partners.
 
The second layer is memberships in key organizations such as the National Golf Course Owners Association, Golf Course Superintendents Association, and Club Managers Association of America. These are very influential in the industry and have marketing channels such as publications, email blasts, and web based marketing. The company also markets directly to course operators through email, surveys direct mail programs.
 
Lead Generation
 
One of the primary sources of lead generation is through the company’s strategic partnerships with EZ-GO, Yamaha, and Ransomes Jacobson. These relationships provide the company with a great deal of market intelligence. The sales forces of the partners work in tandem with the DSG sales team by passing on the leads, creating joint proposals, and distributing TAG sales material. The company has also created co-branded materials for specific value items of interest to operators such as Pace of Play solutions. DSG sale s and marketing staff attend partner sales events to conduct training and discuss marketing strategies.
 
The company is in the process of testing an internal telemarketing program in several key markets to gauge whether this particular channel warrants larger scale implementation.

Product Supply Chain
 
In order to maintain high product quality and control, as well as benefiting from cost savings, the company is currently procuring all main hardware components offshore. Final assembly is locally performed in order to ensure product quality. Other main components are also procured directly from manufacturers or from local suppliers that outsource components office in order to keep the price as low as possible.
 
The company is requesting the suppliers to perform a complete set of quality testing and minimum 24 hours’ burn-in before the product is delivered. The local hardware assembler and components supplier offers 12 months’ warranty. The main hardware components offshore supplier offers a warranty plan of 15 months from the date the product is shipped. With an extended 90 days beyond the current warranty, such repair service would be paid by the supplier except for component replacement costs, which would be paid by DSG.

Another important activity related to the management of the product supply chain is working closely with the suppliers and ensuring that we have alternate sources for the main components and identify well in advance any components that may go “end-of-life” and find suitable replacements before product shortages may occur.
 
Inventory Control
 
The Company has implemented strict inventory management procedures that govern the inbound flow of products from suppliers, the outgoing flow to customers as well as the internal movement of inventory between warehouses (Canada, US and UK). There are also procedures in place to control the flow of equipment returning from customers for repairs and their replacements.
Installation
 
The Company is utilizing a small number of its own field engineers, geographically positioned to be in close proximity of areas with high concentrations of current and future customers. Occasionally, when new installations exceed the internal capacity, the company employs a number of external contractors, on a project by project basis. Each contractor has been trained extensively to perform product installations and the Company has created an extensive collection of Installation Manuals for all products and vehicle types.
 
The product was designed with ease of installation as one of its features. Additionally, the installation process includes a pre-shipping configuration process that prepares each device with all the settings and graphics content (if applicable) required for the specific location it will be deployed. This makes the installation process a lot simpler and less time consuming in the field which reduces costs (accommodations, food, travel) for internal staff as well as external contractor cost (less billable time).
 
Another benefit of the simplified installation procedure is increased scalability in anticipation of increased number of installs in the future by reducing the skill level and training time requirements for additional contractors.
 
Customer Service
 
The company has deployed its Customer Service staff strategically, so it has at least one service representative active during business hours in North America, Europe and South Africa.
 
The company is handling Customer Service directly in North America and UK, offering telephone and on-line support to end-customers. In other international markets, the first-line customer service is handled by local distributor’s staff while DSG is supplying training and more advanced support to the distributors.
 
For the management of the customer service activities, the company is utilizing SalesForce.com CRM system which allows creating, updating, closing and escalation of service cases, including the issuance of RMA (Return Material Authorization) numbers for defective equipment. Using SalesForce.com also allows generation of management reports for service issues, customer satisfaction, and equipment failures in order to quickly identify trends, problem accounts or systemic issues.
 
In addition, DSG will begin to offer the DSG Par 72 Service & Support Plan to guarantee service and support to client courses in the golf business, this program will be available April 2016. This new program for client courses will guarantee service and support program within 24 hours of a problem arising.
 
Product Development and Engineering
 
The company employs a team of software engineers in house to develop and maintain the main components of the server software and firmware.

All product development is derived from business needs assessment and customer requests.
 
The Product Manager is reviewing periodically the list of feature requests with the Sales, establishes priorities and updates the Product Roadmap.
 
The software engineers are also responsible for developing specialized tools and systems utilized increase efficiency in the operation of the company. These projects include functionality such as: automated system monitoring, automatic service alerts, improved remote troubleshooting tools, cellular data monitoring and reporting. All these tools are critical in future ability to support more customers with less resources, streamline support, and improve internal efficiency.
 
All hardware development (electronics and mechanical) is generally outsourced, however small projects like mounting solutions or cabling are handled in house.
