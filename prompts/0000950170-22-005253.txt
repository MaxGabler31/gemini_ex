 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a producer and marketer of innovative, plant-based health and wellness products. Our history as a leader in science-based approaches to developing high value crop improvements, primarily in wheat, designed to enhance farm economics by improving the performance of crops in the field, as well as their value as food ingredients, health and wellness products, and their viability for industrial applications, has laid the foundation for our path forward. We have used non-genetically modified (“non-GMO”) advanced breeding techniques to develop these proprietary innovations which we are now commercializing through the sales of seed and grain, food ingredients and products, hemp extracts, trait licensing and royalty agreements. The recent acquisition of the assets of Lief Holdings, LLC (“Lief”), EKO Holdings, LLC (“EKO”) and Live Zola, LLC (“Zola”) adds bath and body care products, CBD consumer products, as well as coconut water, to our portfolio of products.
 Our commercial strategy is to satisfy consumer nutrition, health and wellness demands with the superior functional benefits our crops deliver directly from the farm, enabling us to share premium economics throughout the ag-food supply chain and to build a world-class estate of high value traits and varieties. The acquisition of the Lief, EKO and Zola brands allows us to broaden our reach within the health and wellness sector.
 It is also estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), that approximately one-fifth of the FDA recommended calories consumed by people in the US are from wheat. Therefore, the market opportunity for nutritional improvements in wheat are significant not only because the wheat market itself is vast, but also because of the “share of stomach” wheat represents. Considering that most people today are not getting enough fiber or protein in their daily diets, the superior nutrient density of our non-GMO GoodWheat (“GoodWheat”) technology can improve the dietary intake of average consumers, by increasing their fiber and protein consumption without changing the way they eat. We believe this proprietary advantage gives GoodWheat the potential to become a global standard in wheat.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
 •Accelerate the monetization of our GoodWheat wheat trait portfolio. Our proprietary IP with multiple non-GMO wheat traits have clear functional benefits, and we will continue to build partnerships across the wheat value chain. We will continue to invest in acquisition, development and retention of the requisite management and industry experience and production and logistics capacity to fully participate in, and control, the route to market for our high value food ingredients.
 •Commercialize and Scale our Arcadia Wellness consumer brands through retail and e-commerce expansion. We plan to expand distribution of our core consumer brands through mass market retailers, grocery store chains, and other specialty nutrition stores, as well as through e-commerce. These brands can penetrate large and growing categories through high-value, differentiated benefits, with the ability to scale and generate attractive margins. We will continue to build our commercialization and scaling expertise, refine go-to-market strategies and invest in effective brand-building.
 •Evaluate acquisitive growth opportunities. We intend to evaluate potential acquisitions representing vertical integration opportunities with multiple benefits to Arcadia’s growth plans. These could include integrating further into our supply chains to enhance margin capture, as well as speed to market new product innovations and food formulations.
Arcadia Wellness, LLC
 In May 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary Arcadia Wellness, LLC, acquired the assets of Eko, Lief, and Zola. We intend for Arcadia Wellness, LLC, to house all of Arcadia Biosciences consumer goods businesses, including core brands GoodWheat, Zola Coconut Water and ProVault Topical Pain Relief, as well as non-core brands SoulSpring and Saavy Naturals Body Care. The core brands will be the focus for investment and expansion.
Our Product Portfolio
 GoodWheat Consumer Products
 The GoodWheat brand is a portfolio of non-GMO wheat-based consumer products that simplifies food ingredient formulations for consumers that are demanding “clean labeling” in their foods, and that are willing to pay a higher retail price for products made with ingredients they recognize. Because GoodWheat increases the nutrient density directly in the primary grains and oils, it provides the mechanism for food formulation simplification naturally and cost effectively to meet evolving consumer demands.
 The brand launch is a key element of the company’s go-to-market strategy to achieve greater value for its innovations by participating in downstream consumer revenue opportunities. We designed the brand to make an immediate connection with consumers that products made with GoodWheat meet their demands for healthier wheat options that also taste great.
 We are preparing for the launch of a line of food products under our GoodWheat brand, with pasta as the initial category to be introduced in the second quarter of 2022. Our pasta products will utilize our GoodWheat grain as the sole ingredient, providing 4X the fiber of traditional pasta and 9g protein per serving without sacrificing taste. In fact, our research shows taste parity to leading pasta brands, which is unique in the growing better-for-you pasta segment. In addition, GoodWheat is the only better-for-you pasta brand made from one simple ingredient, matching consumers’ preference for cleaner labels. Additional categories of products are slated for launch in 2023.

GoodWheat Wheat Traits
 Enhanced Quality Grains
 The GoodWheat brand also encompasses our current and future non-GMO wheat portfolio of high fiber Resistant Starch (RS), Reduced Gluten wheat varieties, and extended shelf life wheat, as well as future wheat innovations. We now hold more than 15 global patents on our high fiber Resistant Starch wheat, protecting both bread wheat and durum (pasta) wheat. Claims granted recently strengthen our intellectual property for our Resistant Starch portfolio of products.
 Our GoodWheat wheat traits redesign wheat as a functional food adding value to the wheat supply chain by enabling a wider range of choices to meet consumer demands. One such program generated multiple bread wheat and pasta wheat lines with very high levels of amylose, leading to increased levels of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. High fiber resistant starch wheat can deliver fiber and other benefits to refined white flour products and also whole grain food products. According to the American Heart Association, on average, Americans consume only approximately 50% of the daily recommended levels of fiber. We believe improving the fiber content of wheat can deliver improved health benefits to a wide population.
High Fiber Resistant Starch Wheat
 Our high fiber resistant starch (RS) wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources. Currently, corn resistant starch is a product in two market segments: dietary fiber additives and modified starch additives. Major growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our RS wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more than eight times higher than the control. RS wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company.
 RS wheat bread flour is currently being introduced to North American bakery and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies by our partners, Bay State Milling. In markets outside North America, RS wheat is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery, ready-to-eat cereals and pasta products with industrial partners. We have many RS wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.
 Reduced Gluten (RG) Wheat
 Many consumers are interested in reducing levels of gluten in their diet. Critically, for some, this is due to having Celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease that impacts many people worldwide with estimates from 1% of the population in Europe to 3.5% in Mexico. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) impacts an estimated additional 6% of the population. Both CD and NCGS are characterized by sensitivity to dietary gluten. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to accomplish for average consumers, efforts to develop alternative approaches are needed.
 Arcadia is continuing to advance a new wheat variety with reduced gluten levels. Our proprietary, non-GMO wheat variety developed using advanced screening and plant breeding techniques have reduced allergenic glutens and increased essential amino acids such as lysine, along with all the other health benefits of high protein wheat. Importantly, this variety also delivers impressively high fiber content at approximately 14 grams per serving compared to 2-3 grams per serving of traditional wheat, providing additional value to health-conscious consumers as well as optionality as we advance the commercialization of this project. We are breeding the trait into additional commercial wheat varieties and working with food processors to give people a choice to enjoy higher quality wheat in the products they love while reducing gluten in their diet.


Improved Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour
 The USDA recommends that “at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich” due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in milled whole grain flour as it progresses through the supply chain. Whole wheat flour from these lines is being tested further for sensory characteristics and improved shelf life stability. This new trait could help improve the shelf life and flavor profile of whole grain products, thus reducing formulation costs and increasing consumer preference and palatability for whole grains.
Product Development
 With our food and wellness products now entering the market, we are firmly in the commercialization phase of our corporate lifecycle. We are de-emphasizing new trait discovery research and development (“R&D”) and are increasing our focus on food-science innovation to fully leverage the value in our existing superior wheat genetics. We are evolving our organizational capabilities to match this strategy progression to include in-house food formulation and CPG supply chain expertise.
 Food Formulation Innovation. We will expand the application of our innovation platform to build on our pipeline of products focused on health and wellness. Our innovation team is focused on using science-based solutions to leverage our wheat and hemp varieties to develop an array of food products and wellness ingredients. Because we are innovating directly from our own well-established plant technology traits, we expect this extension of our involvement will provide more meaningful improvements.
 Field Trials and Breeder & Foundation Seed Production. Our trait evaluation and development staff conducts field operations for both trials and production in American Falls, Idaho, and oversee production in other areas of the country, as needed. Similarly, regulatory trials may be needed to develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.
 Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic and location information for all our plant materials. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. We ensure all of our plant materials are accounted for, tracked and inventoried, which enables us to maintain direct control and proper documentation.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned or exclusively controlled 73 issued patents, 58 pending patent applications worldwide, and 6 pending plant variety protection applications. These totals reflect the following: (i) with respect to the U.S. territory, we owned 23 and exclusively in-licensed 2 U.S. issued patents, and we owned 11 U.S. patent applications and 6 pending plant variety protection applications relating to our plants, trait technologies, and business methods; and (ii) in connection with foreign territories, we owned 28 and exclusively in-licensed 19 foreign issued patents, and owned 48 pending foreign patent applications. With respect to all of the foregoing patent and plant protection assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.


As of December 31, 2021, Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. and Arcadia Wellness, LLC each had five registered trademarks in the United States. We also have three registered trademarks in various other countries.
 Key Collaborations
 We have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed close relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. We believe that the expertise and opportunities created by these collaborations represent important assets to our business. Below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.
Corteva Agriscience
 In 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Corteva Agriscience to jointly develop and commercialize a breakthrough improved wheat quality trait in North America. The collaboration leverages our TILLING platform with Corteva Agriscience’s enabling technology platforms, high-quality elite germplasm and global commercial channels.
 Under the collaboration, the companies will further develop and commercialize an improved wheat quality trait, which has completed initial field trials and is advancing to next-stage field trials. Corteva Agriscience will introgress Arcadia’s trait into its proprietary elite germplasm lines and manage all aspects related to the trait commercialization. Certain development costs will be co-funded, and we will share in the commercial value resulting from products produced.
 Arista Cereal Seeds Pty Ltd and Bay State Milling Company
 In 2019, we entered into an agreement with Arista and Bay State Milling ("BSM"). Under the agreement, BSM is the exclusive commercial partner for our high fiber resistant starch bread wheat in North America under its HealthSense brand portfolio, while Arista has exclusive rights under our high fiber resistant starch bread wheat intellectual property in certain geographies, including Australia and Europe. We will continue to market our high fiber wheat under our GoodWheat portfolio of specialty wheat ingredients in other international markets.
Competition
 The markets for consumer goods are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. We compete with both large, established manufacturers, as well as small, innovative producers of pasta and wellness products. There are several companies working to improve genetics in crops, such as wheat, that may compete with the trait used in our GoodWheat products.
 In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:
 •Companies Selling Wheat Products: As we enter the direct to consumer and retail markets with our GoodWheat products, we believe we face significant competition from a variety of consumer-packaged goods companies. Our competitors in the pasta market range from companies like Banza and Ancient Harvest who offer high-nutrition pasta alternatives to large, traditional pasta producers including Barilla and De Cecco.
 •Specialty health and nutrition ingredient companies: In response to the growing consumer demand for healthier food alternatives, a number of agricultural and food-based companies are augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality food ingredients to market. Calyxt is an agriculture biotechnology company that has a similar strategy to ours to create healthier specialty food ingredients and agriculturally advantageous food crops.


•Coconut water: The beverage industry is competitive. Competitors in this market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, product shelf space, and e-commerce page rankings. Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and sell their products. Competitors in this space include Vita Coco, ZICO, C20 and Harmless Harvest.
 •CBD-based wellness products: The market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Currently, we do not believe that there are any businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD bath and body care products market. Our competitors of CBD-based products include a combination of public and private companies who operate a combination of e-commerce and wholesale brands as well as brick and mortar retail operations like cbdMD and Charlotte’s Web.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 11 full-time employees dedicated to research and product development. Our team possesses technical expertise in a number of fields and activities have been conducted principally at our Davis and Chatsworth, California facilities, with occasional field trials conducted in American Falls, Idaho. In prior years, we have made substantial investments in research and development, and have turned our current focus to developing commercial products, anticipating future research and development expenses to decrease substantially. Our research and development expenses were $3.9 million and $8.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 58 full-time employees. As mentioned above, 11 employees were engaged in research and product development and 47 in management, operations, commercial production, accounting/finance, legal and administration. We believe our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 At Arcadia, we recognize the immense benefits that a diverse team brings to our organization, including delivering better business outcomes. Our talented people leverage their diverse backgrounds and skills toward a common goal: meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same. This spirit of inclusive collaboration can be felt throughout our Company. Our commitment to diversity begins at the highest levels of our organization, as evidenced by the fact that 50% of our Board of Directors are female. From a management perspective, 60% of our CEO's direct reports are female, racially or ethnically diverse, which we believe sets the right tone and expectation for diversity and inclusion within the Company. More broadly, 52% of our employees are female.
 Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")
 Since our founding, Arcadia has been on a mission to enhance crop yields by enabling plants to more efficiently manage environmental and nutrient stresses, and to enhance the quality and value of agricultural and food products. Now that Arcadia has evolved to its commercial stage, the goal is still to lead in a safe, scalable, efficient, and sustainable way. Our Board of Directors oversees ESG matters, and is committed to advancing a sustainable development through our products, working to systematically grow our business to meet the challenges of the global energy transition and combat the global climate crisis.
 Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Davis, California, in a facility consisting of approximately 9,224 square feet of office, laboratory and growth chamber space under a lease which expires on March 31, 2025. This facility accommodates research and development, finance and accounting, investor relations, and administrative activities. Our manufacturing plant is located in Chatsworth, California, in a facility consisting of approximately 14,720 square feet of office, warehouse and production lines. We lease greenhouse space and farmland for agricultural use in Northern California, Idaho, and Hawaii.
