ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Overview.
 
We are primarily focused on the early development of new graphene enabled photovoltaic solar modules, including graphene enabled covered thin-film solar panels. In this production initiative, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent for a joint venture with NanoGraphene, Inc. (doing business as GrapheneCA), a New York based manufacturer with five years’ experience in the manufacture of pure graphene and of the development of newly evolving graphene enhanced high-tech applications, to jointly develop graphene enhanced solar solutions. Of substantial importance, the principal of GrapheneCA has twelve years of experience in the design, construction and establishment of numerous thin film solar production factories through-out the U.S., Europe and Asia. As of September 30,2021, the joint venture has not been formed nor have there been any operations related to the joint venture.
 
The development of graphene enhanced combination silicon materials is currently one of the most intensive areas of research and development, attracting major interests from most world University research divisions and new technology players. Massachusetts Institute of Technology has actually manufactured graphene solar panels.
 
US Thin-Film Corporation (USTFC) was registered in April 2021 in the State of Nevada USA as a wholly owned subsidiary of Graphene & Solar Technologies Limited. On August 23 2021, the Company closed a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement through its wholly owned subsidiary, US Thin-Film Corporation with CIMA Nanotech Holdings Limited, “CNHL”, (a Cayman Island Registered company) to acquire its wholly owned subsidiary company Cima Specialty Materials Ltd and its wholly owned subsidiary companies, one of which holds the valuable portfolio of patents.
 
The portfolio includes several unique and specialised patents, patent applications and new inventions. They cover proprietary transparent conductive thin-film patented technologies from (1) basic manufacturing, (2) chemical formulation, (3) coating processes,(4) final product construct, to (5) transparent conductive thin film technology. Confirming the acquired patent assets as being extremely valuable for US Thin-Film Corporation and its parent, GSTX.
 
 Operational Overview.
 
GRAPHENE - HIGH PURITY MANUFACTURING – This facility will focus on establishing high efficiency and volume graphene production facilities to achieve high-quality, eco-friendly, and scalable graphene production in 2022/3. This initial factory will produce 1.5 tonnes per month (expanding to 12 tonnes +) of medical grade and industrial graphene suitable for applications such as cement 3D printing resin- coatings, epoxy resins and composites, as well as high-end medical connections of brain stem cells and lenses.
 
GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION & AMBIENT AIR – WATER HARVESTING - Water scarcity is at the center of the world’s most significant challenges. The United Nations estimates approximately 30% of the world’s population will face severe water shortages by 2025. Management of the Company has developed a unique proprietary water harvesting technology utilizing modular, self-contained units that can be solar or grid powered, and deployed in urban and rural environments. The water harvester will extract moisture from the ambient air and collect as 100% pure fresh water. Each domestic water harvester will be capable of generating 30-50 liters (8-13 gal) of pure fresh water per day for personal use, with commercial models collecting up to 50,000 liters (13,000 gal) initially per day. The 100% pure H20 extracted from the atmosphere is also the perfect feed stock for the extraction of pure green hydrogen which is also planned as a major production initiative of a production facility complex.
 
Graphene Material.
 
Graphene, a new material, was discovered in 2004 by two UK based Russian university professors who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 for their discovery. Graphene is a 2D material, (one atom thickness) made from graphite/carbon atoms, and whilst still largely unknown to the world is rapidly becoming a new industrial revolution in its own right with more than 8,800 patent applications for graphene and graphene enabled product applications having been filed recently. We have taken an early-stage leading-edge position in this evolving new technological field of graphene enabling and enhancement, specifically to focus upon development of graphene enabled photovoltaic solar panels. Subject to available capital we plan to work with GrapheneCA and other graphene developers to develop a new range of graphene enhanced thin-film solar module associated applications.
 
Graphene is the world’s thinnest and strongest material ever, with remarkable electrical, thermal and optical properties being the most conductive material ever scientifically measured. A sheet of graphene material is only one single atom in thickness and is referred to as a 2D nano-material having almost no measurable depth, only length and width. Graphene is also highly transparent and can be easily flexed and stretched 25% of its size without breaking. However, it is also 200 times stronger than steel and harder than a diamond. It is said that it would take the weight of an elephant balanced on a needlepoint to break through a single one-atom thick graphene sheet. Graphene material is completely impermeable, even a helium atom (the smallest) cannot pass through graphene. The advent of graphene and the introduction of the extraordinary benefits from combining graphene with existing solar industry materials to thereby create an entirely new range of solar grade materials with dramatically increased attributes and properties not previously believed possible before the advent of graphene is therefore of vital importance to the company.

Our main focus remains dedicated to our original premise of developing new leading-edge technologically advanced solar materials and applications, many of which when combined with graphene will ultimately expand the horizons of what is now possible relevant to the generating capacity of solar panels to sensitivity levels not achievable before the invention of graphene. Researchers have already established that the combination of graphene with existing solar materials and solar panel applications can increase the generating efficiency for conventional solar panels from 10%-12% sensitivity in thin-film solar applications, to recently achieved 17% -22% plus.
 
Subject to available funding this combination of existing solar industry materials, and silicon combined with graphene will also greatly benefit our company in ultimately achieving our sales revenues and profitability targets for the benefit of our stockholders.
 
There are thousands of additional unique attributes and properties that make graphene a highly versatile material wit seemingly amazing properties similar to no material other with significant undeveloped potential. The number and variations of possible applications is virtually limitless, including graphene solar panels, graphene super capacitors (game changing graphene batteries that can recharge 5 to 10 times more quickly) than lithium-ion batteries, and cost-effective highly efficient water filtration and purification systems. Researchers have demonstrated graphene-based transistors, flexible networks, quantum dots, spintronic devices, integrated circuits and semiconductor as well as DNA sequencers and drug delivery applications. Adding 1% graphene to plastic makes it electronically conductive.
 
Government Product Approvals. 
 
There are no identified government approvals required for our products and no export restrictions for the products.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business.
 
Management believes that there are no identified existing or probable government regulations that will adversely impact our business.
 
Research and Development Activities.
 
The primary research and development during the next fiscal year will involve further development and evaluation of new efficient processing techniques and applications recently brought about by the development of the new material graphene and the extensive development of new graphene-enabled products. Also, the dramatic complimentary effect the addition of graphene to many existing solar cell production methods and applications will have on the adoption of graphene-based new applications and products that can greatly enhance the generating capacity of existing photovoltaic solar panels with graphene enhancement.
 
Additional research and development resources will be progressively committed to develop new graphene/silica (quartz) and solar grade silicon graphene enabled products and applications to expand and diversify the company product offerings into complimentary solar/semiconductor and energy storage markets.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws.
 
Based upon our long-term experience management believes that the nature of our proposed processing operations do not involve any onerous environmental compliance requirements. Compliance costs have been identified and quantified in the company plan of operations, business plan including financial plan.
Employees.
 
Certain members of our management team have been involved in this industry since 2005 and this has resulted in an experienced team of learned employees, advisors and technical experts in various locations and capacities within both Australia, Central Europe, and in the United States. It is planned to increase fulltime and part time employees/contractors from the present levels to a minimum of 30 within the next 12 months, subject to the company securing additional funding.
 
At the present time we rely upon experienced consultants with whom management has long-term relationships.
