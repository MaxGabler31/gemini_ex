From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen R. Covey in leadership and personal effectiveness, and Hyrum W.

 Business Development
 
During fiscal 2018, we made significant investments in people and content to sell and support the All Access Pass (AAP), sought to innovate and improve the client experience and technology associated with the AAP and Leader in Me online, and worked to integrate the capabilities and content obtained in fiscal 2017 business acquisitions into our mix of available services and products.  During fiscal 2016, we introduced the All Access Pass, which we believe is a ground-breaking service that allows our clients unlimited access to our content through an electronic portal.  We believe the All Access Pass is a revolutionary and innovative way to deliver our content to clients of various sizes, including large, multinational organizations in a flexible and cost-effective manner.  Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity, or use individual concepts from any of our well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs.  During fiscal 2018, we invested in additional implementation specialists to provide our clients with the direction necessary to create meaningful impact journeys using our tools and content.  An impact journey is a customized plan to utilize the content and offerings on the AAP to achieve a client's specific goals and to provide them with the keys to obtain maximum value from the pass.  We also completed the translation of AAP materials into 15 additional languages, which allows the AAP to be used effectively by multinational entities and provides for greater international sales opportunities.
 
We also used additional capital during fiscal 2018 to complete significant upgrades of the AAP portal.  Since the AAP platform is relatively new, we are constantly seeking to improve our clients' experience with the portal through new and innovative technology, content, and impact journeys.  We believe that continued investments in personnel, content, and technological innovation are key to subscription service renewals and the overall growth of our offerings, especially through the All Access Pass.
 
In addition to opening three new sales offices in China in fiscal 2017, during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we acquired the following businesses:
 
 
· | Robert Gregory Partners – In May 2017, we acquired the assets of Robert Gregory Partners, LLC (RGP), a corporate coaching firm with expertise in executive coaching, transition acceleration coaching, leadership development coaching, implementation coaching, and consulting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Jhana Education – In July 2017, we acquired the stock of Jhana Education (Jhana), a company that specializes in the creation and dissemination of relevant, bite-sized content and learning tools for leaders and managers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



During fiscal 2018 we integrated the coaching expertise of RGP into our broad variety of available services and integrated the bite-sized content and tools from Jhana into our All Access Pass and other offerings.  We anticipate that these business acquisitions will continue to provide additional sales opportunities and benefits to our clients.
  
For further information on the impacts of these activities on our operations, refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as found in Item 7 of this report, and our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes located in Item 8.


 Services Overview
 
We operate globally with one common brand and a business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service.  To achieve this high level of service we have sales and support associates in various locations around the United States and Canada, and operate wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.  In foreign locations where we do not have a directly owned office, we may contract with independent licensee partners who deliver our content and provide services in over 150 other countries and territories around the world.
 
Our mission is to "enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere," and we believe that we are experts at solving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior.  We seek to consistently deliver world-class content with the broadest and deepest

distribution capabilities through the most flexible content delivery modalities.  We believe these characteristics distinguish us from our competitors as follows:
 
 
1. | World Class Content – Rather than rely on "flavor of the month" training fads, our content is principle-centered and based on natural laws of human behavior and effectiveness. Our content is designed to build new skillsets, establish new mindsets, and provide enabling toolsets. When our content is applied consistently in an organization, we believe the culture of that organization will change to enable the organization to achieve its own great purposes. Our content is well researched, subjected to numerous field beta tests, and improved through a proven development process. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Breadth and Scalability of Delivery Options – We have a wide range of content delivery options, including: The All Access Pass and Leader in Me online, other intellectual property licensing arrangements, on-site training, training led through certified facilitators, on-line learning, blended learning, and organization-wide transformational processes, including consulting and coaching services. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Global Capability – We not only operate domestically with sales personnel in the United States and Canada, but we also deliver content through our directly owned international offices and independently owned international licensees who deliver our content in over 150 other countries and territories around the world. This capability allows us to deliver content to a wide range of customers, from large, multinational corporations to smaller, local entities. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We hold ourselves responsible for and measure ourselves by our clients' achievement of transformational results.
 
Our content and offerings are designed to help our clients achieve their own great purposes through a variety of resources, including best-selling books and audio, innovative and widely recognized thought leadership, and multiple delivery and teaching methods.  These elements allow us to offer our clients training and consulting solutions that are designed to improve individual and organizational behaviors, deliver content that adapts to an organization's unique needs, and provide meaningful improvements in our clients' business performance.  Further information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com.  However, the information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.
 
Segment Information
 
Our sales are primarily comprised of training and content sales and related products.  During fiscal 2018, we reorganized our internal structure into two divisions.  The Enterprise Division consists of our Direct Office and International Licensee segments.  The former Strategic Markets segment was absorbed by the Direct Office segment since its target customers and sales methodologies were essentially identical.  The Education Division is comprised of our Education practice, which is designed to provide services and products to educational institutions both domestically and internationally.  Our internal structure is now comprised of three segments and a corporate services group.  The following is a brief description of our reportable segments:

· | Direct Offices – Our Direct Office segment has a depth of expertise in helping organizations solve problems that require changes in human behavior, including leadership, productivity, execution, trust, and sales performance. We have a variety of principle-based offerings that help build winning and profitable cultures. This segment includes our sales personnel that serve the United States and Canada; our international sales offices located in Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and Australia; our governmental sales channel; and our public program operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Education Practice – Centered around the principles found in The Leader in Me, the Education practice is dedicated to helping educational institutions build a culture that will produce great results. We believe these results are manifested by increases in student performance, improved school culture, decreased disciplinary issues, and increased teacher 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

engagement and parental involvement.  This segment includes our domestic and international Education practice operations, which are focused on sales to educational institutions such as elementary schools, high schools, and colleges and universities.

· | International Licensees – Our independently owned international licensees provide our offerings and services in countries where we do not have a directly owned office. These licensee partners allow us to expand the reach of our services to large multinational organizations as well as smaller organizations in their countries. This segment's results are primarily comprised of royalty revenues received from these licensees.

Industry Information
 
According to the Training magazine 2018 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is estimated to be $87.6 billion.  The training industry is highly fragmented and includes a wide variety of training and service providers.  We believe our competitive advantages in this industry stem from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, our wide variety of delivery options, and various implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness.  These advantages allow us to deliver not only training to corporations, educational institutions, and individuals, but also to implement the training through powerful behavior-changing tools with the capability to then measure the impact of the delivered content and solutions.
Clients
 
We have a relatively broad base of clients, which includes thousands of organizational, governmental, educational, and individual clients in both the United States and in other countries that are served through our directly owned operations.  We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world which are served through our global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage strong client loyalty.  Our clients are in a broad array of industries and we are not dependent on a single client or industry group.  During the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues.
 
Over our history, we have provided content, services, and products to 97 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 75 percent of the Fortune 500 companies.  We also provide content and services to a number of U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, as well as numerous educational institutions.  Due to the nature of our business, we do not have a significant backlog of orders.  Nearly all of our deferred revenue is attributable to subscription services for which we recognize revenue over the lives of the corresponding agreements.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services comparable with those that we offer.  The nature of the competition in the performance improvement industry, however, is highly fragmented with few large competitors.  Based upon our fiscal 2018 consolidated sales of $209.8 million, we believe that we are a significant competitor in the performance skills and education market.  Other significant comparative companies in the performance improvement market are Development Dimensions International, CRA International, Inc., Learning Tree International Inc., GP Strategies Corp., FTI Consulting, Inc., American Management Association, Wilson Learning, Forum Corporation, The Hackett Group, and the Center for Creative Leadership.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following:
 
 
· | Quality of offerings, services, and solutions
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Skills and capabilities of people
--+----------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------



Given the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of whom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices.  However, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry.  We believe that our competitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content, as indicated by our strong gross margins, branded content, and best-selling books; (2) the breadth of delivery options we are able to offer to customers for utilizing our content, including the All Access Pass and Leader in Me online, live presentations by our own training consultants, live presentations though Company certified client-employed facilitators, intellectual property licensing, web-based presentations, and film-based presentations; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content uniformly across the globe, through our mix of direct offices and our global licensee network; and (4) the significant impact which our offerings can have on our clients' results.  Moreover, we believe that we are a market leader in the U.S. in leadership, execution, productivity, and individual effectiveness content.
 
Seasonality
 
Our fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education Division (when school administrators and faculty have professional development days) and to increased sales that typically occur during that quarter from year-end incentive programs.  Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We do not manufacture any of our products.  We purchase our training materials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and we are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw materials for these products are readily available.  We currently believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and contractors.  Our materials are primarily warehoused and distributed from an independent warehouse facility located in Des Moines, Iowa.
Trademarks, Copyrights, and Intellectual Property
 
Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights.  We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements.  We claim rights for nearly 600 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained registration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and The 7 Habits.  We consider our trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business.
 
We claim over 220 registered copyrights, and own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other printed information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media products, including audio and video media.  We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order to protect our intellectual property rights therein.  We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional, marketing, and advertising materials.  In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter into written confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training consultants, other employees, and licensees.

Employees
 
One of our most important assets is our people.  The diverse and global makeup of our workforce allows us to serve a variety of clients on a worldwide basis.  We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining quality personnel and actively strive to reinforce our employees' commitment to our clients, and to our mission, vision, culture, and values through the creation of a motivational and rewarding work environment.  We currently have approximately 890 associates and none of our associates are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group.  Management believes that its relations with its associates are good and we do not currently foresee a shortage in qualified personnel needed to operate and grow our business.
 
Our benefit programs are designed to be both comprehensive and tailored to the needs of our employee population, such as a paid time off policy that allows for flexibility to meet our associates' needs.  Our wellness benefits are aimed at encouraging employees to be aware of their current state of health and provides various tools and resources to assist them in maintaining their health given the demanding nature of the work.  Through our offered benefits, including health plans, retirement benefits, stock purchase plan, and other benefit programs, we seek to provide a core sense of security to our employees.
