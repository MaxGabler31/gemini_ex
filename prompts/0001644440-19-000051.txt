ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
GCP Applied Technologies Inc. is a global provider of construction products technologies that include admixtures and additives for concrete and cement, the VERIFI® in-transit concrete management system, high-performance waterproofing products and specialty systems. The Company is a leader in its two global operating segments. Specialty Construction Chemicals ("SCC") operating segment produces concrete admixtures, which enhance the properties of concrete and other cementitious construction materials, and cement additives, which improve the performance of Portland cement, the most widely used construction material in the world. Specialty Building Materials ("SBM") operating segment produces building envelope, residential and specialty construction products that protect structures from water, vapor transmission, air penetration and fire damage.
GCP Applied Technologies Inc. was incorporated on May 1, 2015 for the purpose of holding the construction products and packaging technologies businesses of W. R. Grace & Co. On February 3, 2016, Grace shareholders received one common share of GCP for every one common share of Grace held and the construction products and packaging technologies businesses of Grace were transferred to GCP, thereby completing our legal separation from Grace ("the Separation"). On February 4, 2016, we began "regular way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GCP." On July 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our Darex Packaging Technologies ("Darex") business to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (“Henkel”) for $1.06 billion in cash.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated net sales of $1,125.4 million, income from continuing operations before income taxes of $10.5 million and net income of $15.5 million. Approximately 52% of our 2018 sales were generated outside of the United States. We operate in more than 30 countries.

SCC consists of two product groups which include concrete and cement.
Concrete
The concrete product group includes concrete and decorative admixtures, as well as concrete production management and engineered systems.
Concrete admixtures allow concrete producers to use a limited selection of locally-sourced raw materials, such as cement and aggregates, to produce concrete and meet a wide variety of performance specifications. Our products are based on a set of core platform technologies formulated regionally into admixtures tailored to local end-use requirements. 
Examples of our products include CONCERA® admixtures which enable the production of control flow concrete, a high-flowing, segregation-resistant concrete that allows for easier placement while using conventional mix designs. Our CLARENA® admixture product is a chemical additive that mitigates the effects of clay, which helps quarry owners extend the functional lifespan of their property, and, for ready mix producers, adds controllability to concrete containing aggregates with a high clay content. MIRA® admixtures allow concrete to be produced with a lower amount of water, which improves the compressive strength and the long-term durability of the concrete. ADVA® admixtures are used to make flowable "self-compacting concrete" which is popular in precast concrete manufacturing where the rapid filling of large molds is a major driver of economics. ECLIPSE® admixtures are used to minimize the formation of shrinkage cracks in critical applications, such as bridge decks. STRUX® polymeric fibers are designed to improve the ductility of concrete which is a naturally brittle material. In some cases, STRUX® polymeric fibers may be used to replace steel reinforcement near the surface of concrete that will be exposed to corrosive de-icing salts.
Admixtures for decorative concrete are used to enhance the surface appearance and aesthetics of concrete. PIERI® surface retarders are used to obtain exposed aggregate finishes in precast and cast-in-place concrete, achieving the desired surface appearance. PIERI® release agents allow for the efficient removal of mold forms with a resulting higher-quality concrete surface.
Concrete production management systems provide sophisticated process monitoring and control while concrete is in transit to the point of placement. Engineered systems combine proprietary products into high-performance offerings that further reduce installation costs. Our patented concrete production management system, sold under the VERIFI® brand name, measures, monitors and manages critical concrete properties and systematically adds water or admixtures to maintain optimum concrete flow properties. Use of VERIFI® also results in increased product quality, lower material costs, fewer rejected loads, increased logistics and jobsite efficiencies, and minimization of costly project delays.
Our patented engineered floor system, which is marketed and sold under the DUCTILCRETE® brand name, enables the placement and long-term performance of smooth and level floors which is a necessity in modern industrial and commercial buildings. The flooring system provides customers with more sustainable, cost-effective, and low-maintenance surfaces with higher load-bearing capacity than traditional construction. The DUCTILCRETE® system is installed by our network of licensed contractors. The system offers labor and time savings while providing customers with higher quality flat floors.

Cement 
Portland cement is the binding agent for concrete. National standards usually dictate the compressive strength and other properties that must be met by cement. Cement additives are used to reduce the energy required to mill cement to the desired fineness and improve the handling characteristics of the powdered material. These products are also used to adjust the performance of Portland cement, permitting our customers to optimize production economics. 
Examples of our products include OPTEVA® HE quality improvers, which are cement additives that provide options for gaining higher early (HE) strength and are particularly effective for challenging cements. TAVERO® VM grinding aid additives help stabilize vertical roller mills during production by reducing water injection requirements and cement pre-hydration, while at the same time improving cement performance by delivering higher strengths and shorter setting time. HEA2® Cement Additives are used around the world to improve the energy efficiency of cement grinding operations. CBA® Cement Additives are used to produce higher cement strength, which provides a high level of process flexibility to the cement manufacturer. Increasingly, cement manufacturers seek to reduce the environmental impact of their manufacturing processes. Our additives provide greater flexibility in raw materials, enabling customers to achieve improvements such as reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions.

SBM consists of three product groups which include building envelope, residential building products and specialty construction products.
Building Envelope Products
Building envelope products protect structures from water and help manage air and vapor transmission through building walls. The majority of sales in this product group are waterproofing products that protect commercial structures, residential structures and infrastructure. Our waterproofing products are used in both above-grade and below-grade applications. Above grade, our products protect the material to which they are applied and minimize water infiltration into occupied spaces. Below grade, our products enable the construction of structures in challenging sites, such as locations with a high existing water table. Examples of these products include our BITUTHENE® self-adhesive rubberized asphalt membrane, our innovative PREPRUFE® pre-applied sheet membrane, and our ELIMINATOR® liquid applied waterproofing system.

Our BITUTHENE® product line is manufactured globally and has a long track record of providing waterproofing in the most challenging conditions. Designers and contractors have relied on BITUTHENE® products for over 40 years and continue to specify our products by using the BITUTHENE® brand name. We also pioneered the pre-applied waterproofing category with our Advanced Bond Technology™ brand in association with PREPRUFE® products. Our unique technology allows a waterproofing membrane to be installed on the ground or on walls before concrete is placed for a foundation. This technology also allows waterproofing of walls normally inaccessible during the construction of a building, such as foundations in densely populated cities. Major projects around the world have successfully installed our PREPRUFE® waterproofing systems which continue to gain recognition for waterproofing performance. Our ELIMINATOR® liquid applied waterproofing systems are used to protect and extend the life of bridges. Major bridge projects in North America, Europe and Asia have used our ELIMINATOR® systems over the last 20 years.
Residential Building Products
Residential building products consist of roofing underlayments, flashings and weather barriers. Roofing underlayments are placed below the outermost roof covering, such as shingles, to protect sloped roofs from water damage caused by wind-driven rain and ice dams. Our ICE & WATER SHIELD® roofing underlayments are known throughout the industry and are sold in North America through a network of distributors. The VYCOR® flashing portfolio consists of high performance self-adhered flashing products that provide premium protection against water infiltration in critical areas such as windows and doors. Our VYCOR® flashing products reduce the risk of mold and rot development, and contribute to energy efficiency by sealing air leakages in the building envelope.

SALES AND MARKETING
Our two operating segments maintain global direct sales and technical service teams made up of approximately 660 employees supporting customers in over 130 countries worldwide. Our global team sells products under annual and multi-year global, regional and local agreements and has developed deep segment and product application knowledge. We believe that our in depth understanding of our customers' needs, challenges and operations, as well as our ability to service at a high standard throughout the world, give both of our segments a competitive advantage. The majority of our products require local, regional, country and international code approvals related to their use, storage and performance. Our commercial organization supports and consults on committees and technical associations in order to ensure codes and product standards are consistently applied.
Our sales professionals work with leading architects, engineers and contractors across the globe seeking to have our products specified for use in thousands of projects on an annual basis. Our products have been used to build some of the world's most renowned structures. As part of our "go to market" strategy, the SCC team provides technical services to nearly 9,000 concrete and cement production facilities worldwide. In many cases, we also provide product dispensing equipment to our customers as an integral part of the concrete and cement production process.
8

MANUFACTURING, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Our operating segments share global supply chain processes, manufacturing facilities, as well as technical service and sales centers around the world, which provides cost efficiency.
We utilize internal and third-party manufacturing to produce our products to our specifications. Our low capital intensive plants along with third-party manufacturers provide us with flexibility in servicing our customers. Several of our plants ship products internationally, but most of our facilities are positioned to serve local market demand. We have the ability to respond quickly to changes in local demand by establishing or expanding manufacturing capacity with low capital investment. We have numerous multi-year supply and purchasing agreements with both our vendors and customers which helps us minimize volume disruptions. Construction demand is seasonal, resulting in demand variations requiring effective management of our manufacturing and distribution assets. For many of our SCC customers, we install and maintain a chemical dispensing and storage system for our products at their production facilities. We periodically replenish the on-site systems to give our customers instant access to our SCC products in the amounts they require twenty-four hours a day. We also install equipment on ready-mix trucks to monitor and manage concrete in transit to jobsites. This customer-based equipment accounted for approximately 34% of our 2018 annual capital spend.
The raw materials we use in our products are obtained from a variety of suppliers, including basic chemical and petrochemical producers. Many of our raw materials are organic chemicals derived from olefins, including specialty films and fibers. We also make significant purchases of inorganic materials, such as lignin and specialty materials, including plasticizers, films, ethylene derivatives, and rubber. We have multiple raw material sources and balance our purchasing requirements between local and global sources seeking to maximize performance and profitability. Global supply and demand factors, changes in currency exchange rates and petroleum prices can significantly impact the price of our key raw materials.
Our global supply chain team monitors the global market to identify cost and productivity opportunities. We seek to leverage our overall purchasing volumes for all regions. Since we manufacture a portion of our products in emerging regions using raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar and the euro may adversely affect our raw material costs. This effect is partially mitigated by our reliance on local sourcing for some raw materials.
The construction business is cyclical in response to economic conditions, as well as seasonal since it is driven by weather conditions. Demand for our products is primarily driven by global non-residential and infrastructure construction activity and U.S. residential construction activity. We seek to increase profitability and minimize the impact of cyclical downturns in regional economies by introducing technically advanced high-performance products and rationalizing non-profitable geographies.

We have approximately 270 research and development and technical service employees globally and approximately 13% of our workforce is focused on technology. We believe the collective technical expertise, industry knowledge and professionalism of this team is a significant differentiator for us.
We file patent applications globally on a routine basis and obtain grants in numerous countries around the world in support of our products, formulations, manufacturing processes, monitoring systems, equipment, and improvements. We also benefit from technological and commercial advantages protected under trade secret laws, including know-how and other proprietary information related to many of our products, technologies and internal quality control and testing methodologies. Entering 2019, we have approximately 865-900 active patents and patent applications pending in countries around the world, including approximately 150-160 in the U.S. We estimate that our filing rate is between 50 and 90 patent applications globally on an annual basis, including priority and national stage application filings. The average number of patents filed, pending, granted, and maintained could go up or down from year to year, depending on various factors, some of which may not be within our control. It is our intent to continue to file for patents to protect our proprietary innovations and investments in research.
Research and development expenses were $20.2 million, $20.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. These amounts include depreciation and amortization expenses related to research and development assets and expenses incurred in funding external research projects. The amount of research and development expenses relating to government- and customer-sponsored projects (rather than projects that we sponsor) was not material during these periods.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations related to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in remediation actions to address hazardous wastes or other materials as required by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws. 
We continuously seek to improve our environment, health and safety performance. We have expended funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. 
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,100 employees, of which approximately 750 were employed in the United States. Of our total employees, approximately 1,750 were salaried and 350 were hourly.
Approximately 50 of our manufacturing employees in the United States are represented by five different local collective bargaining groups. We have operated without a labor work stoppage for more than 11 years.
We have works councils representing eight of the European countries in which we do business covering approximately 270 employees.
