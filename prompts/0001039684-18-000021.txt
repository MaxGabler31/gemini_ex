ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
We are a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Oklahoma, and our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol “OKE.” We are a leading midstream service provider and own one of the nation’s premier natural gas liquids systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent, Permian and Rocky Mountain regions with key market centers and an extensive network of natural gas gathering, processing, storage and transportation assets. We apply our core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, transporting, storing and marketing natural gas and NGLs through vertical integration across the midstream value chain to provide our customers with premium services while generating consistent and sustainable earnings growth.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Merger Transaction - On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of ONEOK Partners that we did not already own at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.985 of a share of our common stock for each ONEOK Partners common unit. We issued 168.9 million shares of our common stock to third-party common unitholders of ONEOK Partners in exchange for all of the 171.5 million outstanding common units of ONEOK Partners that we previously did not own. As a result of the completion of the Merger Transaction, common units of ONEOK Partners are no longer publicly traded. The change in our ownership interest resulting from the Merger Transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction, and no gain or loss was recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Business Update and Market Conditions - We operate primarily fee-based businesses in each of our three reportable segments. Our consolidated earnings were approximately 90 percent fee-based in 2017, and we expect the same for 2018. In 2017, our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s fee revenues averaged 86 cents per MMBtu, compared with an average of 76 cents and 44 cents per MMBtu in 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to our contract restructuring efforts to mitigate commodity price risk and increasing volumes on those contracts with higher contracted fees. Volumes gathered and processed increased across our asset footprint in our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment in 2017, compared with 2016, as producers experienced improved drilling economics, continued improvements in production due to enhanced completion techniques and more efficient drilling rigs. We connected six third-party natural gas processing plants in our Natural Gas Liquids segment in 2017, which, along with increased supply and ethane recovery, contributed to higher gathered NGL volumes in 2017, compared with 2016. We expect additional NGL volume growth as these plants continue to increase production and recently announced plant connections come online. Our fee-based transportation services in our Natural Gas Pipelines segment increased in 2017, compared with 2016, due primarily to higher firm transportation capacity contracted from our WesTex pipeline expansion.
We continue to expect demand for our midstream services and infrastructure development to be primarily driven by producers who need to connect production with end-use markets where current infrastructure is insufficient. We are responding to this demand by constructing assets, such as our recently announced Elk Creek pipeline, Arbuckle II pipeline, MB-4 fractionator, Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant and other projects discussed below, to meet the needs of producers. We also expect additional demand for our services to support increased demand for NGL products from the petrochemical industry and NGL exporters, and increased demand for natural gas from exports and power plants, some of which were previously fueled by coal. 
We are connected to supply in growing basins and have significant basin diversification across our asset footprint, including the Williston, Denver-Julesburg (DJ), Permian and Powder River Basins and the STACK and SCOOP areas. In addition, we are connected to major market centers for natural gas and NGL products. While our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids segments generate primarily fee-based earnings, those segments’ results of operations are exposed to volumetric risk. Our exposure to volumetric risk can result from declining well productivity, reduced drilling activity, severe weather disruptions, operational outages and ethane rejection.
Rocky Mountain Region - We expect each of our business segments to benefit from increased production in this region, which includes the Williston, DJ and Powder River Basins, where there was an increase in producer activity in 2017, which we expect to continue throughout 2018. In our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, our completed growth projects have increased our gathering and processing capacity to more than 1.0 Bcf/d and allow us to capture additional natural gas. We have available natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin of approximately 125 MMcf/d and approximately one million acres dedicated to us in the core of this basin. With continued volume growth expected due to improved drilling economics and producer efficiencies, we announced plans to construct the 200 MMcf/d Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant in the core 
5

of the Williston Basin. The Demicks Lake plant is expected to provide services necessary to help producers meet natural gas capture targets, while adding incremental NGLs to our NGL gathering system and supplying additional natural gas to our 50 percent owned Northern Border Pipeline. This project is supported by long-term primarily fee-based contracts and acreage dedications. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we are the largest NGL takeaway provider in the Williston Basin with five connections to third-party natural gas processing plants in addition to our own. We connected one new third-party natural gas processing plant in the region in the first quarter 2017. The volume growth in this region has resulted in our existing Bakken NGL Pipeline and the Overland Pass Pipeline, of which we own 50 percent, operating at full capacity. In January 2018, we announced plans to construct the Elk Creek pipeline, which includes construction of an approximately 900-mile pipeline and related infrastructure to transport NGLs from the Rocky Mountain region to our existing Mid-Continent NGL facilities. This project, which is anchored by long-term contracts supported primarily by minimum volume commitments, will have an initial capacity of 240 MBbl/d, with the ability to be expanded to 400 MBbl/d with additional pump facilities. The Elk Creek pipeline project is expected to strengthen our position in the high-production areas of the Williston, Powder River and DJ Basins. In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, our 50 percent-owned Northern Border Pipeline is well-positioned to transport natural gas from processing plants in the Williston Basin, including the recently announced Demicks Lake plant, to end-use markets and is substantially contracted through the fourth quarter 2020.
STACK and SCOOP - We expect each of our business segments to benefit from increased production in the Mid-Continent region from the highly productive STACK and SCOOP areas where there was an increase in producer activity in late 2016 and in 2017, which we expect to continue throughout 2018.
As producers continue to develop the STACK and SCOOP areas, we expect natural gas and NGL volumes on our systems to increase throughout 2018, compared with volumes for the same periods in 2016 and 2017, and expect increased demand for our services from producers that need incremental takeaway capacity for natural gas and NGLs out of the region. We anticipate NGL volume growth in the Mid-Continent region will also be driven by expected increases in ethane recovery as new world-scale ethylene production projects, petrochemical plant expansions and export facilities are completed.
In our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, we have more than 300,000 acres dedicated to us in the STACK and SCOOP areas. In 2017, we announced plans to expand our Canadian Valley natural gas processing facility to 400 MMcf/d from 200 MMcf/d, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The project is supported by long-term primarily fee-based contracts, minimum volume commitments and acreage dedications. In December 2017, we also completed a connection of our natural gas gathering systems in the STACK area to an existing third-party processing facility, accessing up to 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity by constructing a 30-mile natural gas gathering pipeline and related infrastructure. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we are the largest NGL takeaway provider in the STACK and SCOOP areas. We have more than 110 connections to third-party natural gas processing plants in the Mid-Continent region, and in 2017, we connected three third-party natural gas processing plants. We announced plans to expand our natural gas liquids gathering system in the Mid-Continent region and our existing Sterling III pipeline, which are supported by long-term fee-based contracts and expected to be completed by the end of 2018. In February 2018, we announced plans to construct the Arbuckle II pipeline, which includes construction of an approximately 530-mile pipeline and related infrastructure to transport NGLs originating across our supply basins to Mont Belvieu, Texas. This pipeline project will have an initial capacity of 400 MBbl/d, with the ability to be expanded with additional pump facilities. This project is supported by long-term fee-based contracts. In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we are connected to more than 30 natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, which have a total processing capacity of approximately 1.8 Bcf/d, and are expanding our ONEOK Gas Transportation pipeline by 100 MMcf/d to provide increased westbound transportation services from the STACK and SCOOP areas.
Permian Basin - We expect our Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines business segments to benefit from increased production in the Permian Basin from the highly productive Delaware and Midland Basins, where there was an increase in producer drilling activity in late 2016 and in 2017, which we expect to continue throughout 2018.
In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we are well-positioned in the Permian Basin with approximately 40 connections to third-party natural gas processing plants through our WTLPG joint venture, where we connected two third-party natural gas processing plants in 2017. In 2017, we announced that our WTLPG joint venture, in which we own an 80 percent interest, plans to extend its pipeline system into the core of the Delaware Basin, which includes construction of an approximately 120-mile pipeline lateral and related infrastructure to provide an initial incremental capacity of 110 MBbl/d. This project, which we expect to be completed in the third quarter 2018, is supported by long-term dedicated NGL production from two planned third-party natural gas processing plants and positions the West Texas LPG pipeline for significant future NGL volume growth. In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we believe that Roadrunner and our WesTex pipeline are well-positioned to serve growth in the Permian Basin. We are connected to more than 25 natural gas processing plants serving the Permian Basin, which have a total processing capacity of approximately 1.9 Bcf/d. The Roadrunner pipeline transports natural gas from the Permian Basin to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas, and is fully subscribed with 25-year firm demand charge, fee-based agreements. 
6

The Roadrunner pipeline connects with our existing natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure in Texas and, together with our completed WesTex intrastate natural gas pipeline expansion project, creates future opportunities for us to deliver natural gas supply to Mexico.
Gulf Coast - Demand for NGLs is expected to grow at the NGL market center in Mont Belvieu, Texas, as new world-scale ethylene production projects, petrochemical plant expansions and export facilities are completed. We expect increased NGL supply across our assets and construction of our Sterling III and WTLPG pipeline expansions, Elk Creek pipeline and Arbuckle II pipeline projects to result in higher NGL deliveries to this NGL market center. We have significant NGL fractionation and storage assets in this area, and additional capacity is needed to accommodate expected volume growth. In February 2018, we announced plans to construct the 125 MBbl/d MB-4 fractionator and related infrastructure in Mont Belvieu, Texas, which includes additional NGL storage capacity. This project is supported by long-term fee-based contracts and is fully contracted. Following the completion of MB-4, we expect our total NGL fractionation capacity to be 965 MBbl/d.
See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information on our growth projects, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our primary business strategy is to maintain prudent financial strength and flexibility while growing our fee-based earnings and dividends per share with a focus on safe, reliable, environmentally responsible, legally compliant and sustainable operations for our customers, employees, contractors and the public through the following:

• | Operate in a safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and sustainable manner - environmental, safety and health issues continue to be a primary focus for us, and our emphasis on personal and process safety has produced improvements in the key indicators we track. We also continue to look for ways to reduce our environmental impact by conserving resources and utilizing more efficient technologies; 


• | Maintain prudent financial strength and flexibility while growing our fee-based earnings, dividends per share and cash flows from operations in excess of dividends paid - we operate primarily fee-based businesses in each of our three reportable segments. We continue to invest in organic growth projects to expand our existing asset footprint and provide a broad range of services to crude oil and natural gas producers and end-use markets. In February 2018, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share ($3.08 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 25 percent compared with the same quarter in the prior year. Our dividend increase and expected future dividend growth is due in part to the increase in cash flows resulting from the Merger Transaction and our growth projects. Since June 2017, we have announced organic growth projects totaling approximately $4.2 billion supported by a combination of long-term primarily fee-based contracts, minimum volume commitments and acreage dedications; 


• | Manage our balance sheet and maintain investment-grade credit ratings - we seek to maintain investment-grade credit ratings. In January 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock generating net proceeds of $1.2 billion, which we expect to satisfy our equity financing needs through 2018 and well into 2019. Following the equity offering, we had $2.5 billion of borrowing capacity available and expect to fund our growth projects through cash from operations and a combination of short- and long-term debt; and 


• | Attract, select, develop and retain a diverse group of employees to support strategy execution - we continue to execute on our recruiting strategy that targets professional and field personnel in our operating areas. We also continue to focus on employee development efforts with our current employees and monitor our benefits and compensation package to remain competitive. 

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We report operations in the following business segments:

• | Natural Gas Gathering and Processing;


• | Natural Gas Liquids; and


• | Natural Gas Pipelines.

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing
Overview - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment provides midstream services to contracted producers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma. Raw natural gas is typically gathered at the wellhead, compressed and transported through pipelines to our processing facilities. In order for the natural gas to be accepted by the downstream market, it must have contaminants, such as water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, removed and NGLs separated for further processing. Processed natural gas, usually referred to as residue natural gas, is then recompressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines, 
7

storage facilities and end users. The separated NGLs are sold and delivered through natural gas liquids pipelines to fractionation facilities for further separation.
Rocky Mountain region - The Williston Basin, which is located in portions of North Dakota and Montana, includes the oil-producing, NGL-rich Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations, is an active drilling region. Our completed growth projects in the Williston Basin since 2016 have increased our gathering and processing capacity to more than 1.0 Bcf/d and allow us to capture increased natural gas production from new wells and previously flared natural gas production.
The Powder River Basin is primarily located in Wyoming, which includes the NGL-rich Niobrara Shale and Frontier, Turner and Sussex formations where we provide gathering and processing services to customers in the southeast portion of Wyoming. 
Mid-Continent region - The Mid-Continent region is an active drilling region and includes the oil-producing, NGL-rich STACK and SCOOP areas and the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Meramec, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime formations of Oklahoma and Kansas; and the Hugoton and Central Kansas Uplift Basins of Kansas.
Revenues - Revenues for this segment are derived primarily from commodity sales and the following types of services contracts:

• | POP with fee-based components - This type of contract includes contractual fees for gathering, treating, compressing and processing the producer’s natural gas. We also generally purchase the producer’s raw natural gas, which we process into residue natural gas and NGLs, then we sell these commodities and associated condensate to downstream customers. We remit sales proceeds to the producer according to the contractual terms and retain our portion. This type of contract represented approximately 96 percent and 94 percent of supply volumes in this segment for 2017 and 2016, respectively. There are a variety of factors that directly affect our POP with fee revenues, including: 


– | the price of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs;


– | the composition of the natural gas and NGLs produced;


– | the fees we charge for our services; and


– | the volume produced.

Over time as our contracts are renewed or restructured, we have generally increased the fee components. In some POP with fee contracts, instead of remitting cash payments to the producer, we deliver an agreed-upon percentage of residue gas and/or NGLs to the producer (take-in-kind) and sell the volumes we retain to third parties. Additionally, under certain POP with fee contracts our contractual fees may increase or decrease if production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices change relative to specified thresholds.

• | Fee-only - Under this type of contract, we are paid a fee for the services we provide, based on volumes gathered, processed, treated and/or compressed. Our fee-only contracts represented approximately 4 percent and 6 percent of supply volumes in this segment for 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

We contract to deliver residue natural gas, condensate and/or unfractionated NGLs to downstream customers at a specified delivery point. Our sales of NGLs are typically to our affiliate in the Natural Gas Liquids segment.
Upon adoption of Topic 606 in January 2018, the contractual fees we charge producers on the majority of our POP with fee contracts will be recorded as a reduction of the purchase price in cost of sales and fuel. In 2017 and prior periods, we recorded these fees as services revenue. The contractual fees on POP with fee contracts that include producer take-in-kind rights will continue to be recorded as services revenue, as we do not control the raw natural gas stream while we are providing midstream services. We do not expect adoption of the standard to be material to this segment’s operating income.
Property - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment owns the following assets:

• | approximately 11,400 miles and 7,700 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, respectively;


• | nine natural gas processing plants with approximately 800 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Mid-Continent region, and 11 natural gas processing plants with approximately 1,050 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Rocky Mountain region; and


• | approximately 15 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids fractionation capacity at various natural gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region.

In addition, we have access to up to 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Mid-Continent region through a long-term processing services agreement with an unaffiliated third party.
8

Utilization - The utilization rates for our natural gas processing plants were approximately 79 percent and 76 percent for 2017 and 2016, respectively. We calculate utilization rates using a weighted-average approach, adjusting for the dates that assets were placed in service.
Unconsolidated Affiliates - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

• | 49 percent ownership in Bighorn Gas Gathering, which gathers coal-bed methane produced in the Powder River Basin;


• | 37 percent ownership in Fort Union Gas Gathering, which gathers coal-bed methane produced in the Powder River Basin and delivers it to the interstate pipeline system;


• | 35 percent ownership interest in Lost Creek Gathering Company, which gathers natural gas produced from conventional dry natural gas wells in the Wind River Basin of central Wyoming and delivers it to the interstate pipeline system; and


• | 10 percent ownership interest in Venice Energy Services Co., a natural gas processing facility near Venice, Louisiana.

See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our unconsolidated affiliates.
Market Conditions and Seasonality - Supply - Our natural gas gathered and processed volumes increased in 2017, compared with 2016, due primarily to the following:

• | producers focusing their drilling and completion in the most productive areas with favorable economics where we have significant gathering and processing assets; and


• | continued producer improvements in production due to enhanced completion techniques and more efficient drilling rigs; offset partially by


• | natural production declines.

We expect our natural gas volumes to continue to grow in 2018 due to the production activities discussed above.
Rocky Mountain region - In the Williston Basin, we have significant natural gas gathering and processing assets and substantial acreage dedications. Natural gas volumes increased in 2017, compared with 2016, due primarily to new supply and completion of growth projects, offset partially by the impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter 2017. 
Mid-Continent region - In the Mid-Continent region, we have significant natural gas gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. We had higher natural gas gathered and processed volumes in 2017, compared with 2016, due to increased producer activity in the STACK and SCOOP areas, where we have substantial acreage dedications. 
Demand - Demand for gathering and processing services is dependent on natural gas production by producers, which is driven by the strength of the economy; producer firm commitments to transportation pipelines; natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices; and the demand for each of these products from end users. We generally contract with crude oil and natural gas producers who have proven reserves or are currently producing natural gas in areas within our existing infrastructure and need gathering and processing services. Additionally, demand is impacted by the weather, which is discussed below under “Seasonality.”
Rocky Mountain region - Demand for our gathering and processing services in the Williston Basin has remained strong in both high and low commodity price environments. Requirements in North Dakota for producers to reduce natural gas flaring have increased the need for our services to capture, gather and process natural gas, and we are responding by constructing assets, such as our recently announced Demicks Lake natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure. We have approximately 125 MMcf/d of available capacity from our more than 1.0 Bcf/d of processing assets. Upon completion of the Demicks Lake plant, we will have more than 1.2 Bcf/d of processing capacity in this region.
Mid-Continent region - As producers continue to develop the STACK and SCOOP areas, we expect increased demand for our services. We have approximately 100 MMcf/d of available processing capacity in Oklahoma. We are responding to producers’ needs by constructing assets, such as the 200 MMcf/d expansion of our Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant, which will increase our processing capacity to 1.2 Bcf/d in this region.
Commodity Prices - We have significantly reduced our direct exposure to commodity prices in this segment and our earnings are primarily fee-based.
9

See discussion regarding our commodity price risk and related hedging activities under “Commodity Price Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Seasonality - Cold temperatures usually increase demand for natural gas and certain NGL products such as propane, the main heating fuels for homes and businesses. Warm temperatures usually increase demand for natural gas used in gas-fired electric generators for residential and commercial cooling, as well as agriculture-related equipment like irrigation pumps and crop dryers. During periods of peak demand for a certain commodity, prices for that product typically increase.
Extreme weather conditions and seasonal temperature changes impact the volumes and composition of natural gas gathered and processed. A freeze-off is a phenomenon where water produced with natural gas freezes at the wellhead or within the gathering system. This causes a temporary interruption in the flow of natural gas. Our operations may be affected by other weather conditions that may cause a loss of electricity at our facilities or prevent access to certain locations that affect a producer’s ability to produce oil and natural gas wells or our ability to connect new wells to our systems. 
Competition - We compete for natural gas supply with other midstream gatherers and processors, major integrated oil companies, independent exploration and production companies that have gathering and processing assets, and pipeline companies and their affiliated marketing companies. The factors that typically affect our ability to compete for natural gas supply are:

• | quality of services provided;


• | producer drilling activity;


• | proceeds remitted and/or fees charged under our gathering and processing contracts;


• | location of our gathering systems relative to those of our competitors;


• | location of our gathering systems relative to drilling activity;


• | operating pressures maintained on our gathering systems;


• | efficiency and reliability of our operations;


• | delivery capabilities for natural gas and NGLs that exist in each system and plant location; and


• | cost of capital.

We continue to evaluate opportunities to increase earnings and cash flows, and reduce risk by:

• | improving natural gas processing efficiency;


• | constructing new assets;


• | reducing operating costs;


• | consolidating assets; and


• | decreasing commodity price exposure.

Customers - Our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment derives services revenue primarily from crude oil and natural gas producers, which include both large integrated and independent exploration and production companies. Our downstream commodity sales customers are primarily utilities, large industrial companies, marketing companies and our NGL affiliate. See discussion regarding our customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Government Regulation - The FERC traditionally has maintained that a natural gas processing plant is not a facility for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce and, therefore, is not subject to jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has made no specific declaration as to the jurisdictional status of our natural gas processing operations or facilities, our natural gas processing plants are primarily involved in extracting NGLs and, therefore, are exempt from FERC jurisdiction. The Natural Gas Act also exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. We believe our natural gas gathering facilities and operations meet the criteria used by the FERC for nonjurisdictional natural gas gathering facility status. Interstate transmission facilities remain subject to FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has historically distinguished between these two types of facilities, either interstate or intrastate, on a fact-specific basis. We transport residue natural gas from certain of our natural gas processing plants to interstate pipelines in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota also have statutes regulating, to varying degrees, the gathering of natural gas in those states. In each state, regulation is applied on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is filed against the gatherer with the appropriate state regulatory agency.
See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.

Natural Gas Liquids
Overview - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment owns and operates facilities that gather, fractionate, treat and distribute NGLs and store NGL products, primarily in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and the Rocky Mountain region, which includes the Williston, DJ and Powder River Basins, where we provide midstream services to producers of NGLs and deliver those products to the two primary market centers, one in the Mid-Continent in Conway, Kansas, and the other in the Gulf Coast in Mont Belvieu, Texas. We own or have an ownership interest in FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado, and terminal and storage facilities in Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois. We also own FERC-regulated natural gas liquids distribution and refined petroleum products pipelines in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana that connect our Mid-Continent assets with Midwest markets, including Chicago, Illinois. The majority of the pipeline-connected natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle are connected to our natural gas liquids gathering systems. We own and operate truck- and rail-loading and -unloading facilities connected to our natural gas liquids fractionation and pipeline assets. 
Most natural gas produced at the wellhead contains a mixture of NGL components, such as ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline. The NGLs that are separated from the natural gas stream at natural gas processing plants remain in a mixed, unfractionated form until they are gathered, primarily by pipeline, and delivered to fractionators where the NGLs are separated into NGL products. These NGL products are then stored or distributed to our customers, such as petrochemical manufacturers, heating fuel users, ethanol producers, refineries, exporters and propane distributors. 
Revenues - Revenues for our Natural Gas Liquids segment are derived primarily from commodity sales and fee-based services. We also purchase NGLs and condensate from third parties, as well as from our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. Our fee-based services have increased due primarily to new supply connections, expansion of existing connections and the completion of capital-growth projects. Our business activities are categorized as exchange services, transportation and storage services, and optimization and marketing, which are defined as follows:

• | Exchange services - we utilize our assets to gather, fractionate and/or treat, and transport unfractionated NGLs, thereby converting them into marketable NGL products shipped to a market center or customer-designated location. Many of these exchange volumes are under contracts with minimum volume commitments that provide a minimum level of revenues regardless of volumetric throughput. Our exchange services activities are primarily fee-based and include some rate-regulated tariffs; however, we also capture certain product price differentials through the fractionation process. 


• | Transportation and storage services - we transport NGL products and refined petroleum products, primarily under FERC-regulated tariffs. Tariffs specify the maximum rates we may charge our customers and the general terms and conditions for transportation service on our pipelines. Our storage activities consist primarily of fee-based NGL storage services at our Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast storage facilities. 


• | Optimization and marketing - we utilize our assets, contract portfolio and market knowledge to capture location, product and seasonal price differentials through the purchase and sale of NGLs and NGL products. We primarily transport NGL products between Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, to capture the location price differentials between the two market centers. Our marketing activities also include utilizing our natural gas liquids storage facilities to capture seasonal price differentials. A growing portion of our marketing activities serves truck and rail markets. Our isomerization activities capture the price differential when normal butane is converted into the more valuable iso-butane at our isomerization unit in Conway, Kansas. 

In many of our exchange services contracts, we purchase the unfractionated NGLs at the tailgate of the processing plant and deduct contractual fees related to the transportation and fractionation services we must perform before we can sell them as NGL products. Upon adoption of Topic 606 in January 2018, these fees will be recorded as a reduction to the NGL purchase price in cost of sales and fuel. In 2017 and prior periods, we recorded these fees as exchange services revenue. We do not expect adoption of the standard to be material to this segment’s operating income.
Supply growth from the development of NGL-rich areas and capacity available on pipelines that connect the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast resulted in NGL price differentials remaining narrow between the Mid-Continent market center at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast market center at Mont Belvieu, Texas. We expect relatively narrow price differentials to persist between these two market centers until demand for NGLs increases from petrochemical companies and exporters, which we expect as ethylene producers continue to complete their expansion projects and international demand for NGLs increases export volumes.

Property - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment owns the following assets:

• | approximately 2,800 miles of non-FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines with peak capacity of approximately 800 MBbl/d;


• | approximately 170 miles of non-FERC-regulated natural gas liquids distribution pipelines with peak transportation capacity of approximately 66 MBbl/d;


• | approximately 4,300 miles of FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines with peak capacity of approximately 683 MBbl/d;


• | approximately 4,200 miles of FERC-regulated natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products distribution pipelines with peak capacity of 993 MBbl/d;


• | one natural gas liquids fractionator in Oklahoma with operating capacity of approximately 210 MBbl/d, two natural gas liquids fractionators in Kansas with combined operating capacity of 280 MBbl/d and two natural gas liquids fractionators in Texas with combined operating capacity of 150 MBbl/d;


• | 80 percent ownership interest in one natural gas liquids fractionator in Texas with our proportional share of operating capacity of approximately 128 MBbl/d;


• | interest in one natural gas liquids fractionator in Kansas with our proportional share of operating capacity of approximately 11 MBbl/d;


• | one isomerization unit in Kansas with operating capacity of 9 MBbl/d;


• | six natural gas liquids storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with operating storage capacity of approximately 22.2 MMBbl;


• | eight natural gas liquids product terminals in Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois;


• | above- and below-ground storage facilities associated with our FERC-regulated natural gas liquids pipeline operations in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Kansas with combined operating capacity of 978 MBbl; and


• | one ethane/propane splitter in Texas with operating capacity of 32 MBbl/d of purity ethane and 8 MBbl/d of propane.

In addition, we lease approximately 3.5 MMBbl of combined NGL storage capacity at facilities in Kansas and Texas and have access to 60 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids fractionation capacity in Texas through a fractionation service agreement.
Utilization - The utilization rates for our various assets, including leased assets, have been impacted by ethane rejection. The utilization rates for 2017 and 2016, respectively, were as follows:

• | our non-FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines were approximately 73 percent and 66 percent;


• | our FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines were approximately 78 percent and 77 percent;


• | our FERC-regulated natural gas liquids distribution pipelines were approximately 57 percent and 56 percent; and


• | our natural gas liquids fractionators were approximately 74 percent and 70 percent.

We calculate utilization rates using a weighted-average approach, adjusting for the dates that assets were placed in service. Our fractionation utilization rate reflects approximate proportional capacity associated with our ownership interests.
Unconsolidated Affiliates - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

• | 50 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which operates an interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system extending approximately 760 miles, originating in Wyoming and Colorado and terminating in Kansas;


• | 50 percent ownership interest in Chisholm Pipeline Company, which operates an interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system extending approximately 185 miles from origin points in Oklahoma and terminating in Kansas; and


• | 50 percent ownership interest in Heartland Pipeline Company, which operates a terminal and pipeline system that transports refined petroleum products in Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa.

See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.
Market Conditions and Seasonality - Supply - The unfractionated NGLs that we gather and transport originate primarily from natural gas processing plants connected to our natural gas liquids gathering systems in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and the Rocky Mountain region. Our Natural Gas Liquids segment is the largest NGL takeaway provider for the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Williston Basin. Our fractionation operations receive NGLs from a variety of processors and pipelines, including our affiliates, located in these regions. Supply for our Natural Gas Liquids segment depends on crude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities by producers, the decline rate of existing production, natural gas processing plant economics and capabilities, and the NGL content of the natural gas that is produced and processed in the areas in which we operate. 
12

Supply growth has resulted in available ethane supply that is greater than the petrochemical industry’s current demand. Low or unprofitable price differentials between ethane and natural gas have resulted in varied levels of ethane rejection at most of our and our customers’ natural gas processing plants connected to our NGL system in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions. Ethane rejection levels across our system averaged more than 150 MBbl/d in 2017, which is slightly lower than 2016 despite an increase in overall supply volumes. We expect ethane rejection on our system to decrease to approximately 70 MBbl/d by the end of 2018, initially in regions closest to market centers such as the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent region, as ethylene producers continue to complete their expansion projects and NGL exporters increase their export volumes in 2018 and beyond.
Demand - Demand for NGLs and the ability of natural gas processors to successfully and economically sustain their operations affect the volume of unfractionated NGLs produced by natural gas processing plants, thereby affecting the demand for NGL gathering, fractionation and transportation services. Natural gas and propane are subject to weather-related seasonal demand. Other NGL products are affected by economic conditions and the demand associated with the various industries that utilize the commodity, such as butanes and natural gasoline used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil. Ethane, propane, normal butane and natural gasoline are used by the petrochemical industry to produce chemical products, such as plastic, rubber and synthetic fibers. Several petrochemical companies are constructing new plants, plant expansions, additions or enhancements that improve the light-NGL feed capability of their facilities due primarily to the increased supply and attractive price of ethane, compared with crude oil-based alternatives, as a petrochemical feedstock in the United States. The demand for NGLs is expected to continue to increase from petrochemical companies and exporters in the coming months as ethylene producers complete their expansion projects and international demand for NGLs increases export volumes. Increasing producer activity in high-production areas is driving the need for additional gathering and fractionation services, such as our recently announced Sterling III and WTLPG pipeline expansions, Elk Creek pipeline, Arbuckle II pipeline and MB-4 projects.
Commodity Prices - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment provides primarily fee-based services. However, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the price of NGLs; the location differential between the Mid-Continent, Chicago, Illinois, and Gulf Coast regions; and the relative price differential between natural gas, NGLs and individual NGL products, which affect our NGL purchases and sales, and our exchange services, transportation and storage services, and optimization and marketing financial results. Supply growth from the development of NGL-rich areas and capacity available on pipelines that connect the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast resulted in 2017 NGL price differentials remaining narrow between the Mid-Continent market center at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast market center at Mont Belvieu, Texas. However, location price differentials for the fourth quarter 2017 were some of the widest that we have experienced since 2012. NGL storage revenue may be affected by price volatility and forward pricing of NGL physical contracts versus the price of NGLs on the spot market.
Seasonality - Our natural gas liquids fractionation and pipeline operations typically experience some seasonal variation. Some NGL products stored and transported through our assets are subject to weather-related seasonal demand, such as propane, which can be used for heating during the winter and for agricultural purposes such as crop drying in the fall. Demand for butanes and natural gasoline, which are primarily used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil, may also be subject to some variability during seasonal periods when certain government restrictions on motor fuel blending products change. The ability of natural gas processors to produce NGLs also is affected by weather. Extreme weather conditions and ground temperature changes impact the volumes of natural gas gathered and processed and NGL volumes gathered, transported and fractionated. Power interruptions, inaccessible well sites as a result of severe storms or freeze-offs, a phenomenon where water produced from natural gas freezes at the wellhead or within the gathering system, cause a temporary interruption in the flow of natural gas and NGLs. 
Competition - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment competes with other fractionators, intrastate and interstate pipeline companies, storage providers, and gatherers and transporters for NGL supply in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions. The factors that typically affect our ability to compete for NGL supply are:

• | quality of services provided;


• | producer drilling activity;


• | the petrochemical industry’s level of capacity utilization and feedstock requirements;


• | fees charged under our contracts;


• | current and forward NGL prices;


• | location of our gathering systems relative to our competitors;


• | location of our gathering systems relative to drilling activity;


• | proximity to NGL supply areas and markets;


• | efficiency and reliability of our operations;


• | receipt and delivery capabilities that exist in each pipeline system, plant, fractionator and storage location; and

13


• | cost of capital.

We have responded to these factors by making capital investments to access new supplies; increasing gathering, fractionation and distribution capacity; increasing storage, withdrawal and injection capabilities; and reducing operating costs so that we may compete effectively. Our competitors continue to invest in natural gas liquids pipeline and fractionation infrastructure to address the growing NGL supply and petrochemical demand. As our growth projects and those of our competitors have alleviated constraints between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast NGL market centers, we expect relatively narrow price differentials between these two market centers to persist until demand for NGLs increases from petrochemical companies and exporters. In addition, our and our competitors’ natural gas liquids infrastructure projects provide NGL supply from the Rocky Mountain region, Marcellus and Utica basins into the Gulf Coast market center, which affects NGL prices and competes with and could displace NGL supply volumes from the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions where our assets are located. We believe our natural gas liquids fractionation, pipelines and storage assets are located strategically, connecting diverse supply areas to market centers.
Customers - Our Natural Gas Liquids segment’s customers are primarily NGL and natural gas gathering and processing companies; major and independent crude oil and natural gas production companies; propane distributors; ethanol producers; and petrochemical, refining and NGL marketing companies. See discussion regarding our customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Government Regulation - The operations and revenues of our natural gas liquids pipelines are regulated by various state and federal government agencies. Our interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are regulated by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service; rates, including depreciation and amortization policies; and initiation of service. In Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, certain aspects of our intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines that provide common carrier service are subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, KCC and RRC, respectively.
PHMSA has asserted jurisdiction over certain portions of our fractionation facilities in Bushton, Kansas, that it believes are subject to its jurisdiction. We have objected to the scope of PHMSA’s jurisdiction and are seeking resolution of this matter. We do not anticipate that the cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.
Natural Gas Pipelines
Overview - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment provides transportation and storage services to end users through its wholly owned assets and its 50 percent ownership interests in Northern Border Pipeline and Roadrunner.
Interstate Pipelines - Our interstate pipelines are regulated by the FERC and are located in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico. Our interstate pipeline companies include:

• | Midwestern Gas Transmission, which is a bidirectional system that interconnects with Tennessee Gas Transmission Company’s pipeline near Portland, Tennessee, and with several interstate pipelines that have access to both the Utica Shale and the Marcellus Shale at the Chicago Hub near Joliet, Illinois;


• | Viking Gas Transmission, which is a bidirectional system that interconnects with a TransCanada Corporation pipeline at the United States border near Emerson, Canada, and ANR Pipeline Company near Marshfield, Wisconsin;


• | Guardian Pipeline, which interconnects with several pipelines at the Chicago Hub near Joliet, Illinois, and with local natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin; and


• | OkTex Pipeline, which has interconnections with several pipelines in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.

Intrastate Pipelines - Our intrastate natural gas pipeline assets in Oklahoma transport natural gas through the state and have access to the major natural gas production areas in the Mid-Continent region, which include the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Meramec, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime formations. Our intrastate natural gas pipeline assets in Oklahoma serve end-use markets, such as local distribution companies and power generation companies. In Texas, our intrastate natural gas pipelines are connected to the major natural gas producing formations in the Texas Panhandle, including the Granite Wash formation and Delaware, Cline and Midland producing formations in the Permian Basin. These pipelines are capable of transporting natural gas throughout the western portion of Texas, including the Waha Hub where other pipelines may be accessed for transportation to western markets, exports to 
14

Mexico, the Houston Ship Channel market to the east and the Mid-Continent market to the north. Our intrastate natural gas pipeline assets also have access to the Hugoton and Central Kansas Uplift Basins in Kansas.
Revenues - Revenues in this segment are derived primarily from transportation and storage services. 
Our transportation revenues are primarily fee-based from the following types of services:

• | Firm service - Customers reserve a fixed quantity of pipeline capacity for a specified period of time, which obligates the customer to pay regardless of usage. Under this type of contract, the customer pays a monthly fixed fee and incremental fees, known as commodity charges, which are based on the actual volumes of natural gas they transport or store. Under the firm service contract, the customer generally is guaranteed access to the capacity they reserve. 


• | Interruptible service - Under interruptible service transportation agreements, the customer may utilize available capacity after firm service requests are satisfied. The customer is not guaranteed use of our pipelines unless excess capacity is available. 

Our regulated natural gas transportation services contracts are based upon rates stated in the respective tariffs, which have generally been established through shipper specific negotiation, discounts and negotiated settlements. The rates are filed with FERC or the appropriate state jurisdictional agencies. In addition, customers typically are assessed fees, such as a commodity charge, and we may retain a percentage or specified volume of natural gas in-kind based on the natural gas volumes transported.
Our storage revenues are primarily fee-based from the following types of services:

• | Firm service - Customers reserve a specific quantity of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and generally pay fixed fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved plus an injection and withdrawal fee. Firm storage contracts typically have terms longer than one year. 


• | Park-and-loan service - An interruptible service offered to customers providing the ability to park (inject) or loan (withdraw) natural gas into or out of our storage, typically for monthly or seasonal terms. Customers reserve the right to park or loan natural gas based on a specified quantity, including injection and withdrawal rights when capacity is available. 

We own natural gas storage facilities located in Texas and Oklahoma that are connected to our intrastate natural gas pipelines. We also have underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas. In Texas and Kansas, natural gas storage operations may be regulated by the state in which the facility operates and by the FERC for certain types of services. In Oklahoma, natural gas storage operations are not subject to rate regulation by the state, and we have market-based rate authority from the FERC for certain types of services.
Property - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment owns the following assets:

• | approximately 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines with approximately 3.5 Bcf/d of peak transportation capacity;


• | approximately 5,200 miles of state-regulated intrastate transmission pipelines with peak transportation capacity of approximately 3.5 Bcf/d; and


• | approximately 52.2 Bcf of total active working natural gas storage capacity.

Our storage includes two underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, two underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas and two underground natural gas storage facilities in Texas.
Utilization - Our natural gas pipelines were approximately 94 percent and 92 percent subscribed in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and our natural gas storage facilities were 64 percent and 65 percent subscribed in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Unconsolidated Affiliates - Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

• | 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, which owns a FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Montana-Saskatchewan border near Port of Morgan, Montana, and the Williston Basin in North Dakota to a terminus near North Hayden, Indiana.


• | 50 percent interest in Roadrunner, which has the capacity to transport approximately 570 MMcf/d of natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas. We are the operator of Roadrunner. 

See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.

Market Conditions and Seasonality - Supply - The development of shale and other resource areas has continued to increase available natural gas supply across North America and has caused location and seasonal price differentials to narrow in the regions where we operate.
Interstate - Guardian Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission and Viking Gas Transmission access supply from the major producing regions of the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains, Canada, Gulf Coast and the Northeast. The current supply of natural gas for Northern Border Pipeline is primarily sourced from Canada; however, as the Williston Basin supply area has developed, more natural gas supply from this area is being transported on Northern Border Pipeline to markets near Chicago. In addition, supply volumes from nontraditional natural gas production areas, such as the Marcellus and Utica shale areas in the Northeast, may compete with and displace volumes from the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and Canadian supply sources in our markets. Factors that may impact the supply of Canadian natural gas transported by our pipelines are primarily the availability of United States supply, Canadian natural gas available for export, Canadian storage capacity, government regulation and demand for Canadian natural gas in Canada and United States consumer markets.
Intrastate and Storage - Our intrastate pipelines and storage assets may be impacted by the pace of drilling activity by crude oil and natural gas producers and the decline rate of existing production in the major natural gas production areas in the Permian Basin and the Mid-Continent region. 
Demand - Demand for our services is related directly to our access to supply and the demand for natural gas by the markets that our natural gas pipelines and storage facilities serve. Demand is also affected by weather, the economy, natural gas price volatility and regulatory changes.

• | Weather - The effect of weather on our natural gas pipelines operations is discussed below under “Seasonality.”


• | Economy - The strength of the economy directly impacts manufacturing and industrial companies that consume natural gas.


• | Price volatility - Commodity price volatility can influence producers’ decisions related to the production of natural gas. Our pipeline customers, primarily natural gas and electric utilities, require natural gas to operate their businesses and generally are not impacted by location price differentials. However, narrower location price differentials may impact demand for our services from natural gas marketers as discussed below under “Commodity Prices.” 


• | Regulatory - Demand for our services is also affected as coal-fired electric generators are retired and replaced with power generation from natural gas. EPA regulations on emissions from coal-fired electric-generation plants have increased the demand for natural gas as a fuel for electric generation, as well as related transportation and storage services. The demand for natural gas and related transportation and storage services is expected to increase over the next several years as regulations continue to be implemented. 

Commodity Prices - Although our revenues are primarily fee-based, commodity prices can affect our results of operations.

• | Transportation - We are exposed to market risk through interruptible contracts or when existing firm contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation with customers that have competitive alternatives.


• | Storage - Natural gas storage revenue is impacted by the differential between forward pricing of natural gas physical contracts and the price of natural gas on the spot market.


• | Fuel - Our fuel costs and the value of the retained fuel in-kind received for our services also are impacted by changes in the price of natural gas.

Seasonality - Demand for natural gas is seasonal. Weather conditions throughout North America may significantly impact regional natural gas supply and demand. High temperatures may increase demand for gas-fired electric generation needed to meet the electricity demand required to cool residential and commercial properties. Cold temperatures may lead to greater demand for our transportation services due to increased demand for natural gas to heat residential and commercial properties. Low precipitation levels may impact the demand for natural gas that is used to fuel irrigation activity in the Mid-Continent region.
To the extent that pipeline capacity is contracted under firm-service transportation agreements, revenue, which is generated primarily from fixed-fee charges, is not significantly impacted by seasonal throughput variations.
Natural gas storage is necessary to balance the relatively steady natural gas supply with the seasonal demand of residential, commercial and electric-generation users. The majority of our storage capacity is either contracted under firm-service agreements or is used for park-and-loan services. We retain a portion of our storage capacity for operational purposes.
16

Competition - Our natural gas pipelines and storage facilities compete directly with other intrastate and interstate pipeline companies and other storage facilities. Competition among pipelines and natural gas storage facilities is based primarily on fees for services, quality and reliability of services provided, current and forward natural gas prices, proximity to natural gas supply areas and markets, and access to capital. Competition for natural gas transportation services continues to increase as new infrastructure projects are completed and the FERC and state regulatory bodies continue to encourage more competition in the natural gas markets. Regulatory bodies also are encouraging the use of natural gas for electric generation that has traditionally been fueled by coal. The combined cost of coal and the associated rail transportation continues to be competitive with the cost of natural gas; however, the clean-burning aspects of natural gas and abundance of supply make it an economically competitive and environmentally advantaged alternative. We believe that our pipelines and storage assets compete effectively due to their strategic locations connecting supply areas to market centers and other pipelines.
Customers - Our natural gas pipeline assets primarily serve local natural gas distribution companies, electric-generation facilities, large industrial companies, municipalities, producers and marketing companies. Our utility customers generally require our services regardless of commodity prices. See discussion regarding our customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Government Regulation - Interstate - Our interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated under the Natural Gas Act, which gives the FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of this business, such as transportation of natural gas, rates and charges for services, construction of new facilities, depreciation and amortization policies, acquisition and disposition of facilities, and the initiation and discontinuation of services.
Intrastate - Our intrastate natural gas pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are regulated by the OCC, KCC and RRC, respectively, and by the FERC under the Natural Gas Policy Act for certain services where we deliver natural gas into FERC regulated natural gas pipelines. While we have flexibility in establishing natural gas transportation rates with customers, there is a maximum rate that we can charge our customers in Oklahoma and Kansas and for the services regulated by the FERC. In Texas and Kansas, natural gas storage may be regulated by the state and by the FERC for certain types of services. In Oklahoma, natural gas storage operations are not subject to rate regulation by the state, and we have market-based rate authority from the FERC for certain types of services.
See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.
SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Customers and Total Assets - See Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for disclosure by segment of our adjusted EBITDA and total assets and for a discussion of revenues from external customers.
Other
Through ONEOK Leasing Company, L.L.C. and ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C., we own a 17-story office building (ONEOK Plaza) with approximately 505,000 square feet of net rentable space and a parking garage in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our headquarters are located. ONEOK Leasing Company, L.L.C. leases excess office space to others and operates our headquarters office building. ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C. owns and operates a parking garage adjacent to our headquarters.
REGULATORY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS
Environmental Matters - We are subject to multiple federal, state, local and/or tribal historical preservation and environmental laws and/or regulations that affect many aspects of our present and future operations. Regulated activities include, but are not limited to, those involving air emissions, storm water and wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, wetlands and waterways preservation, cultural resources protection, hazardous materials transportation, and pipeline and facility construction. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and/or comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances, registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, licenses and permits may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. For example, if a leak or spill of hazardous substances or petroleum products occurs from pipelines or facilities that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including response, investigation and cleanup costs, which could affect materially our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, emissions controls and/or other regulatory or permitting mandates under the Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure that existing 
17

environmental statutes and regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us.
There is a belief that emissions of GHGs is linked to global climate change. GHG emissions originate primarily from combustion engine exhaust, heater exhaust and fugitive methane gas emissions. International, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit GHG emissions, including initiatives directed at issues associated with climate change. Various federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of GHGs, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation by the EPA. In addition, there have been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs.
Our environmental and climate change actions focus on minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment. These actions include: (i) developing and maintaining an accurate GHG emissions inventory according to current rules issued by the EPA; (ii) improving the efficiency of our various pipelines, natural gas processing facilities and natural gas liquids fractionation facilities; (iii) following developing technologies for emissions control and the capture of carbon dioxide to keep it from reaching the atmosphere; and (iv) utilizing practices to reduce the loss of methane from our facilities.
We participate in the EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Program to reduce voluntarily methane emissions. We continue to focus on maintaining low rates of lost-and-unaccounted-for methane gas through expanded implementation of best practices to limit the release of natural gas during pipeline and facility maintenance and operations.
We believe it is likely that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit GHG emissions from our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations will take, the stringency of the regulations or when they will become effective. In addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted.
For additional information regarding the potential impact of laws and regulations on our operations see Item 1A “Risk Factors.” 
Pipeline Safety - We are subject to PHMSA safety regulations, including pipeline asset integrity-management regulations. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 requires pipeline companies operating high-pressure pipelines to perform integrity assessments on pipeline segments that pass through densely populated areas or near specifically designated high-consequence areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) increased maximum penalties for violating federal pipeline safety regulations, directs the DOT and Secretary of Transportation to conduct further review or studies on issues that may or may not be material to us and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations.
Since 2015, PHMSA has issued notices of proposed rule-making for hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations, natural gas transmission and gathering lines and underground natural gas storage facilities, none of which have become final. The potential capital and operating expenditures related to the proposed regulations are unknown, but we do not anticipate a material impact to our planned capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the current or pending regulations.
Air and Water Emissions - The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, analogous state laws and/or regulations impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into the air and water in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, a federally enforceable operating permit is required for sources of significant air emissions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution-control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals for sources of air emissions. The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for the removal of pollutants discharged to waters of the United States and remediation of waters affected by such discharge.
International, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit GHG emissions, including initiatives directed at issues associated with climate change. We monitor all relevant legislation and regulatory initiatives to assess the potential impact on our operations and otherwise take efforts to limit GHG emissions from our facilities, including methane. The EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires annual GHG emissions reporting from affected facilities and the carbon dioxide emission equivalents for the natural gas delivered by us and the emission equivalents for all NGLs produced by us as if all of these products were combusted, even if they are used otherwise.
Our 2016 total reported emissions were approximately 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. This total includes direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in our equipment, such as compressor engines and heaters, as well as carbon 
18

dioxide equivalents from natural gas and NGL products delivered to customers and produced as if all such fuel and NGL products were combusted. The additional cost to gather and report this emission data did not have, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, Congress has considered, and may consider in the future, legislation to reduce GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. Likewise, the EPA may institute additional regulatory rule-making associated with GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. At this time, no rule or legislation has been enacted that assesses any costs, fees or expenses on any of these emissions.
We closely monitor proposed and final rule-makings. At this time we do not anticipate a material impact to our planned capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the current or pending regulations and EPA actions. However, the EPA may issue additional regulations, responses, amendments and/or policy guidance, which could alter our present expectations. Generally, EPA rule-makings require expenditures for updated emissions controls, monitoring and recordkeeping requirements at affected facilities.
Chemical Site Security - The United States Department of Homeland Security (Homeland Security) released the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards in 2007, and the new final rule associated with these regulations was issued in December 2014. We provided information regarding our chemicals via Top-Screens submitted to Homeland Security, and our facilities subsequently were assigned one of four risk-based tiers ranging from high (Tier 1) to low (Tier 4) risk, or not tiered at all due to low risk. To date, one of our facilities has been given a Tier 4 rating. Facilities receiving a Tier 4 rating are required to complete Site Security Plans and possible physical security enhancements. We do not expect the Site Security Plans and possible security enhancement costs to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Pipeline Security - The United States Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration and the DOT have completed a review and inspection of our “critical facilities” and identified no material security issues. Also, the Transportation Security Administration has released new pipeline security guidelines that include broader definitions for the determination of pipeline “critical facilities.” We have reviewed our pipeline facilities according to the new guideline requirements, and there have been no material changes required to date.
