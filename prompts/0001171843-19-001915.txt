Overview of the Business
 
Capstone Therapeutics Corp. (the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a biotechnology company committed to developing a pipeline of novel peptides and other molecules aimed at helping patients with under-served medical conditions. Previously, we were focused on the development and commercialization of two product platforms: AZX100 and Chrysalin (TP508). In 2012, we terminated the license for Chrysalin (targeting orthopedic indications). In 2014, we terminated the license for AZX100 (targeting dermal scar reduction). Capstone no longer has any rights to or interest in Chrysalin or AZX100.
 
On August 3, 2012, we entered into a joint venture, LipimetiX Development, LLC, (now LipimetiX Development, Inc.), (the “JV”), to develop Apo E mimetic peptide molecule AEM-28 and its analogs. The JV has a development plan to pursue regulatory approval of AEM-28, and/or an analog, as treatment for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (granted Orphan Drug Designation by FDA in 2012), other hyperlipidemic indications, and acute coronary syndrome/atherosclerosis regression. The initial AEM-28 development plan extended through Phase 1a and 1b/2a clinical trials and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. The clinical trials had a safety primary endpoint and an efficacy endpoint targeting reduction of cholesterol and triglycerides.
 
In early 2014, the JV received allowance from regulatory authorities in Australia permitting the JV to proceed with the planned clinical trials. The Phase 1a clinical trial commenced in Australia in April 2014 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial commenced in Australia in June 2014. The clinical trials for AEM-28 were randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of six escalating single doses (Phase 1a in healthy patients with elevated cholesterol) and multiple ascending doses of the three highest doses from Phase 1a (Phase 1b/2a in patients with hypercholesterolemia and healthy volunteers with elevated cholesterol and high Body Mass Index). The Phase 1a clinical trial consisted of 36 patients and the Phase 1b/2a consisted of 15 patients. Both clinical trials were completed in 2014 and the Medical Safety Committee, reviewing all safety-related aspects of the clinical trials, observed a generally acceptable safety profile. As first-in-man studies, the primary endpoint was safety; yet efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled dataset favoring AEM-28 versus placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints.
 
Concurrent with the clinical development activities of AEM-28, the JV has performed pre-clinical studies that have identified analogs of AEM-28 and a new formulation, that have the potential of increased efficacy, higher human dose toleration and an extended composition of matter patent life (application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2014). The JV’s current intent is to prioritize the development of an analog of AEM-28, specifically AEM-28-08.
 
The JV and the Company are exploring fundraising, partnering or licensing, to obtain additional funding to continue development activities, and operations.
 
The JV and the Company do not have sufficient funding at this time to continue additional material development activities. The JV may conduct future clinical trials in Australia, the USA, and other regulatory jurisdictions if regulatory approvals, additional funding, and other conditions permit.
 
The Company, funding permitting, intends to continue limiting its internal operations to a virtual operating model while monitoring and participating in the management of JV’s development activities.

Description of Current Peptide Drug Candidates.
 
Apo E Mimetic Peptide Molecule – AEM-28 and its analogs
 
Apolipoprotein E is a 299 amino acid protein that plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) is in a class of protein that occurs throughout the body. Apo E is essential for the normal metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides. After a meal, the postprandial (or post-meal) lipid load is packaged in lipoproteins and secreted into the blood stream. Apo E targets cholesterol and triglyceride rich lipoproteins to specific receptors in the liver, decreasing the levels in the blood. Elevated plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis, the buildup of cholesterol rich lesions and plaques in the arteries. AEM-28 is a 28 amino acid mimetic of Apo E and AEM-28 analogs are also 28 amino acid mimetics of Apo E (with an aminohexanoic acid group and a phospholipid), and both contain a domain that anchors into a lipoprotein surface while also providing the Apo E receptor binding domain, which allows clearance through the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors (Syndecan-1) in the liver. AEM-28 and its analogs, as Apo E mimetics, have the potential to restore the ability of these atherogenic lipoproteins to be cleared from the plasma, completing the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, and thereby reducing cardiovascular risk. This is an important mechanism of action for AEM-28 and its analogs. Atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease and cerebral artery disease, and can cause heart attack, loss of limbs and stroke. Defective lipid metabolism also plays an important role in the development of adult onset diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes), and diabetics are particularly vulnerable to atherosclerosis, heart and peripheral artery diseases. Our joint venture has an Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Research Foundation for a broad domain of Apo E mimetic peptides, including AEM-28 and its analogs.
Company History
 
Prior to November 26, 2003, we developed, manufactured and marketed proprietary, technologically- advanced orthopedic products designed to promote the healing of musculoskeletal bone and tissue, with particular emphasis on fracture healing and spine repair. Our product lines, which included bone growth stimulation and fracture fixation devices, are referred to as our “Bone Device Business.” In November 2003, we sold our Bone Device Business.
 
In August 2004, we purchased substantially all of the assets and intellectual property of Chrysalis Biotechnology, Inc., including its exclusive worldwide license for Chrysalin, a peptide, for all medical indications. Subsequently, our efforts were focused on research and development of Chrysalin with the goal of commercializing our products in fresh fracture healing. (In March 2012, we returned all rights to the Chrysalin intellectual property and no longer have any interest in, or rights to, Chrysalin.)
 
In February 2006, we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of AzERx, Inc. Under the terms of the transaction, we acquired an exclusive license for the core intellectual property relating to AZX100, an anti-fibrotic peptide. In 2014, we terminated the License Agreement with AzTE (Licensor) for the core intellectual property relating to AZX100 and returned all interest in and rights to the AZX100 intellectual property to the Licensor.
 
On August 3, 2012, we entered into a joint venture with LipimetiX Development, LLC, (now LipimetiX Development, Inc.) to develop Apo E mimetic peptide molecule AEM-28 and its analogs.
 
Our development activities represent a single operating segment as they shared the same product development path and utilized the same Company resources. As a result, we determined that it is appropriate to reflect our operations as one reportable segment.
 
OrthoLogic Corp. commenced doing business under the trade name of Capstone Therapeutics on October 1, 2008, and we formally changed our name from OrthoLogic Corp. to Capstone Therapeutics Corp. on May 21, 2010.

Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and confidentiality. Cholesterol reduction therapy is one of the largest drug markets served by numerous approved medications and with numerous potential therapies in various stages of clinical development. Well known cardiovascular drug classes include the statins and PCSK9s. Our drug candidates, if approved, would not compete directly for the same patient population as statins and PCSK9s. In the orphan indication of HoFH, two drugs received FDA approval in 2013: Juxtapid from Aegerion and Kynamro from Sanofi/Genzyme. Juxtapid is currently being marketed and sold; Kynamro has been withdrawn from market. We may not be aware of the other biotechnology, pharmaceutical companies or public institutions that are developing pharmaceuticals or devices that may compete with our potential products. We also may not be aware of all the other competing products our known competitors are pursuing. In addition, these biotechnology companies and public institutions compete with us in recruiting for research personnel and subjects, which may affect our ability to complete our research studies. For additional discussion regarding the risks associated with our competition, see the risk factor “If our JV’s product candidates do not gain market acceptance or our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our JV’s product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated” in the “Risk Factors” section in this Annual Report on Form 10K.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
AEM-28 or its analogs are not currently available for sale and we do not expect it to be available for sale for some time into the future, if ever. Thus, neither we nor our JV currently have any marketing or sales staff. External consultants and members of our staff provide some technical marketing support relating to the development of, and market need for, new potential products and additional therapeutic applications of products already under research.
Research and Development
 
At December 31, 2018, we utilize consultants to perform all administrative, regulatory or research tasks. We have entered into consulting agreements with former employees in an effort to retain their availability to render services if and when needed.
 
Our research and development for 2018 and 2017 consisted primarily of work with or through our joint venture.
 
Through our joint venture, LipimetiX Development, Inc. (“JV”), we incurred expenses of $1.4 million and $1.2 million relating to AEM-28 or its analogs research efforts in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The JV has a development plan to pursue regulatory approval of AEM-28 or its analogs, as treatment for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, other hyperlipidemic indications, and acute coronary syndrome/atherosclerosis regression. The initial AEM-28 development plan extended through Phase 1a and 1b/2a clinical trials and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. The clinical trials had a safety primary endpoint and an efficacy endpoint targeting cholesterol and lipid reduction.
 
In early 2014, JV received allowance from regulatory authorities in Australia permitting the JV to proceed with the planned clinical trials of AEM-28. The Phase 1a clinical trial commenced in Australia in April 2014 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial commenced in Australia in June 2014. The clinical trials for AEM-28 were randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of six escalating single doses (Phase 1a in healthy patients with elevated cholesterol) and multiple ascending doses of the three highest doses from Phase 1a (Phase 1b/2a in patients with hypercholesterolemia and healthy subjects with elevated cholesterol and high Body Mass Index). The Phase 1a clinical trial consisted of 36 patients and the Phase 1b/2a consisted of 15 patients. Both clinical trials were completed in 2014 and the Medical Safety Committee, reviewing all safety-related aspects of the clinical trials, observed a generally acceptable safety profile. As first-in-man studies, the primary endpoint was safety; yet efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled dataset favoring AEM-28 versus placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints.

Concurrent with the development activities with AEM-28, the JV performed limited pre-clinical studies that have identified analogs of AEM-28 and a new formulation, that have the potential of greater efficacy, higher human dose toleration and an extended composition of matter patent life (application filed in 2014).
 
Manufacturing
 
Currently, third parties certified under Good Manufacturing Practices manufacture AEM-28 and its analogs for the JV in limited amounts for our clinical and pre-clinical studies. We use a primary manufacturer for the peptides used in our human clinical trials, but secondary manufacturers are available as needed. AEM-28 and its analogs chemistry, manufacturing and control plan is currently based on an infusion formulation.
Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights
 
The JV has an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Agreement) with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Research Foundation (“UABRF”) covering a broad domain of Apo-E mimetic peptides including AEM-28 and certain analogs (included as Exhibit 10.7 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2012, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 10, 2012, and as amended effective December 15, 2014, included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 30, 2015). The Agreement calls for payment of patent filing, maintenance and other related patent fees, as well as a royalty of 3% on Net Sales of Licensed Products during the Term of the Agreement. The Agreement terminates upon the expiration of all Valid Patent Claims within the Licensed Patents, currently estimated to be 2035. The Agreement, as amended, also calls for annual maintenance payments of $25,000, various milestone payments of $50,000 to $500,000 and minimum royalty payment of $500,000 to $1,000,000 per year commencing on January 1 of the first calendar year following the year in which the First Commercial Sale occurs. UABRF will also receive 5% of Non-Royalty Income received.
Insurance
 
Our business entails the risk of product liability claims. We currently have no product liability coverage. We are not currently engaged in clinical trials. We maintain a general liability insurance policy and an umbrella excess liability policy. There can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the coverage limit of such policies or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Product liability claims or claims arising from our clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not experienced any material liability claims to date resulting from our clinical trials.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we utilized consultants to perform all administrative, regulatory or research tasks. We have entered into consulting agreements with various former key employees, but there is no assurance that these persons will be available in the future to the extent their services may be needed. As a research and development business, we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified research personnel, both as employees and as consultants. We face competition from private companies and public institutions for qualified research personnel. In prior years, none of our employees were represented by a union and we considered our relationship with our employees to be good.
