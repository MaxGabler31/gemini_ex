ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview
Lionsgate is a global content platform whose films, television series, digital products and linear and over-the-top platforms reach next generation audiences around the world. In addition to our filmed entertainment leadership, Lionsgate content drives a growing presence in interactive and location-based entertainment, gaming, virtual reality and other new entertainment technologies. Lionsgate's content initiatives are backed by a 16,000-title film and television library and delivered through a global licensing infrastructure. 
We manage and report our operating results through three reportable business segments: Motion Pictures, Television Production and Media Networks. Financial information for our segments is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.
Motion Pictures
Our Motion Pictures segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the United States and through a sub-distributor in Canada).


• | Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis.


• | Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets.


• | International. International revenues are derived from the licensing from our international subsidiaries of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also include revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom


• | Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management division (including location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our film and television content to ancillary markets.

Television Production
Our Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following:

• | Domestic Television. Domestic television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to domestic markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.

MOTION PICTURES
Motion Pictures - Theatrical
Theatrical Production
Theatrical production consists of “greenlighting” (proceeding with production) and financing motion pictures, as well as the development of screenplays, filming activities and the post-filming editing/post-production process.
We take a disciplined approach to theatrical production with the goal of producing content that can be distributed through various domestic and international platforms. We typically attempt to mitigate the financial risk associated with production by, among other things: 

• | Negotiating co-financing development and co-production agreements (which provide for joint efforts and cost-sharing between us and one or more third-party companies);


• | Pre-licensing international distribution rights on a selective basis, including through international output agreements (which refers to licensing the rights to distribute a film in one or more media generally for a limited term, in one or more specific territories prior to completion of the film);


• | Structuring agreements that provide for participation by talent in the financial success of the motion picture in exchange for reducing guaranteed amounts that would be paid regardless of the film's success (referred to as “up-front payments”)


• | Utilizing governmental incentives, programs and other structures from state and foreign countries (which typically take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies or cash rebates, calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production).

Our approach to acquiring films for theatrical release is similar to our approach to film production. We generally seek to limit our financial exposure in acquiring films while adding films of quality and commercial viability to our release schedule and library.
Theatrical Distribution
In general, the economic life of a motion picture consists of its exploitation in theaters, on packaged media and on various digital and television platforms in territories around the world.
Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. We distribute motion pictures directly to movie theaters in the U.S. Generally, distributors and exhibitors will enter into agreements whereby the exhibitor retains a portion of the “gross box office receipts,” which are the admissions paid at the box office. The balance is remitted to the distributor. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets. After the initial theatrical release, distributors seek to maximize revenues by releasing movies in sequential release date windows, which may be exclusive against other non-theatrical distribution channels.
We construct release schedules taking into account moviegoer attendance patterns and competition from other studios' scheduled theatrical releases. We use either wide (generally, more than 2,000 screens nationwide) or limited initial releases, depending on the film. We believe that we generally spend significantly less on prints and advertising for a given film than other studios and design our marketing plans to cost-effectively reach a large audience.
Producing, marketing and distributing a motion picture can involve significant risks and costs, and can cause our financial results to vary depending on the timing of a motion picture’s release. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition, and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window.
We may revise the release date of a motion picture as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as we believe is likely to maximize revenues or for other business reasons. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed, that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget, or that the film will ever be released.

Motion Pictures - Home Entertainment
Our U.S. home entertainment distribution operation exploits our film and television content library of approximately 16,000 motion picture titles and television episodes and programs, consisting of titles from, among others, Lionsgate, our subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures (such as Starz, Summit Entertainment, Anchor Bay Entertainment, Artisan Entertainment, CodeBlack Films, Grindstone Entertainment Group, Modern Entertainment, Trimark, Pantelion Films and Roadside Attractions), as well as titles from third parties such as A24, A&E, Amazon Studios, AMC, CBS Films, Entertainment Studios, Marvel, Miramax, Saban Entertainment, StudioCanal, The Orchard, and Tyler Perry Studios. 
Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged media and digital revenue.
Packaged Media
Packaged media distribution involves the marketing, promotion and sale and/or lease of DVDs/Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers who then sell or rent the DVDs/Blu-ray discs to consumers for private viewing. Fulfillment of physical distribution services are substantially licensed to Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.
 We distribute or sell content directly to retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Amazon, Costco and others who buy large volumes of our DVDs/Blu-ray discs to sell directly to consumers. Sales to Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 43% of net home entertainment packaged media revenue in fiscal 2018. We also directly distribute content to the rental market through Redbox, Netflix and others.
Of these titles, certain are released through our subsidiary, Grindstone Entertainment Group, which acquires and/or produces titles as finished pictures and as “pre-buys” based on script, cast and genres, and creates targeted key art, marketing materials and release plans, which are then distributed direct-to-video, VOD and through other media. In fiscal 2018, Grindstone Entertainment Group released 33 titles.
 Additionally, we distribute television product including series such as American Gods, Ash vs. Evil Dead, Blue Mountain State, Casual, Counterpart, Duck Dynasty, Fear the Walking Dead, Grace and Frankie, Graves, Narcos, Knightfall, MacGyver, Into the Badlands, Mad Men, Nurse Jackie, Orange Is The New Black, Power, The Royals, The Walking Dead, Weeds, library titles such as Alf and Little House on the Prairie, certain Disney-ABC Domestic Television series, as well as premier children's brands including our Alpha and Omega franchise, Saban Brand’s Power Rangers, Aardman’s Shaun the Sheep library, LeapFrog Entertainment's LeapFrog, MGA Entertainment's LalaLoopsy and Bratz, American Greetings' Care Bears, and our catalog of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Marvel Animated Features.

A Madea Halloween, and Wonder (which held onto the number one spot for two (2) consecutive weeks).


• | In fiscal 2018, we shipped approximately 65 million DVD/Blu-ray finished units.


• | In calendar 2017, we had an approximate 11% market share for home entertainment, making us the number five (5) studio in market share overall.


• | In calendar 2017, we a maintained a box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate of 18% above the industry average, leading all major studios. Box office-to-home entertainment conversion rate is calculated as the ratio of the total of both first cycle DVD release revenues and total digital platform revenues for a theatrical release compared to the total North American box-office revenues from such theatrical release.

Music
Our film and television music departments creatively oversee music for our theatrical and television slates, and certain of our SVOD and direct-to-digital productions, respectively. Our music strategy is to service the Company’s creative divisions’ music needs, while providing music for use in marketing our films and television shows. For our theatrical slate, the work of the music department includes overseeing songs, scores and soundtracks for all of our productions, co-productions and acquisitions. For our television slate, the work of the music department includes overseeing music staffing, scores and soundtracks for all of our television productions. For our SVOD and digital productions, the work of the music department includes musical oversight similar to our theatrical and television slates, and provided on an as-needed basis.  Music revenues are derived from the sales and licensing of music from our films, television, and other productions, and the theatrical exhibition of our films and the broadcast and webcast of our productions.
Ancillary Revenues
12

Ancillary revenues are derived from the licensing of non-theatrical uses of our films and television content to distributors who, in turn, make such content available to airlines, hotels, schools, oil rigs, public libraries, prisons, community groups, the armed forces, ships at sea and others.
TELEVISION PRODUCTION
Our television business consists of the development, production, syndication and distribution of television programming. We principally generate revenue from the licensing and distribution of such programming to broadcast television networks, pay and basic cable networks, digital platforms and syndicators of first-run programming, which license programs on a station-by-station basis and pay in cash or via barter (i.e., trade of programming for airtime). Each of these platforms may acquire a mix of original and library programming.
After initial exhibition, we distribute programming to subsequent buyers, both domestically and internationally, including basic cable network, premium subscription services or digital platforms (known as “off-network syndicated programming”). Off-network syndicated programming can be sold in successive cycles of sales which may occur on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. In addition, television programming is sold on home entertainment (packaged media and via digital delivery) and across all other applicable ancillary revenue streams including music publishing, touring and integration.
As with film production, we use tax credits, subsidies, and other incentive programs for television production in order to maximize our returns and ensure fiscally responsible production models.
Television Production - Domestic Television
We currently produce, syndicate and distribute nearly 90 television shows on more than 40 networks (including programming produced by Pilgrim Media Group, of which we own a majority interest).
In fiscal 2018, syndicated programming (through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Debmar-Mercury) and scripted and unscripted programming produced, co-produced or distributed by us and our affiliated entities (other than Starz) included, among others, the following:

Lionsgate UK also continues to build a robust television business alongside its premier film brand through in-house production/development, as well as through its various joint ventures and investments. Lionsgate UK holds interests in, and has strategic partnerships with, television and film production company Kindle Entertainment, non-scripted television production company Primal Media, television drama company Potboiler Television, and film and television production company Bonafide Films. Additionally, Lionsgate UK has enhanced its television production efforts with nearly twenty (20) projects currently being developed in-house. 
In fiscal 2018, our Lionsgate UK television programming (developed in-house and through Lionsgate UK’s interest and partnerships) included the following:

MEDIA NETWORKS
Media Networks- Starz Networks
Starz Networks is a leading provider of premium subscription video programming to U.S. MVPDs, including cable operators (such as Comcast and Charter), satellite television providers (such as DIRECTV and DISH Network), telecommunications companies (such as AT&T and Verizon), OTT providers (such as Amazon) and on a direct-to-consumer basis.
Our Starz Networks’ flagship premium service STARZ had 23.5 million subscribers as of March 31, 2018 (not including subscribers who receive programming free as part of a promotional offer). STARZ offers original series and recently released and library movies without advertisements. Our Starz Networks’ other services, STARZ ENCORE and MOVIEPLEX, offer theatrical and independent library movies as well as original and older television series also without advertisements. Our services include 17 linear networks, on-demand and online viewing platforms, and a stand-alone direct-to-consumer service. The linear networks air over 1,000 movies per month from studio partners, including first-run content from Sony Pictures Entertainment, and have a growing line-up of successful original programming. Our Starz Networks’ services are offered by Distributors to their subscribers either at a fixed monthly price as part of a programming tier or package or on an a la carte basis, or directly to consumers via the STARZ app at www.starz.com or through our retail partners (such as Apple and Google) for a monthly fee.
The table below depicts our 17 existing linear services, the respective on-demand service, the STARZ app service and highlights some of their key attributes. 
Demographics
Our Starz Networks’ services deliver Obsessable™ original series and hit movies that appeal to a wide range of audiences, attracting both die hard and casual viewers and serving a variety of fandoms. We are focused on developing and delivering content to meet the needs of engaged viewers, including African Americans, Latino, LGBTQIA and female audiences.
16

Built to serve both our traditional MVPDs as well as the OTT community, the STARZ app is a best-in-class subscription video app designed with fans in mind. In addition to targeting MVPD subscribers, the STARZ app targets audiences who are looking for an alternative to a traditional subscription package. The primary audience for the app consists of a balanced mix of individuals, who are cost-conscious, heavy consumers of video content and likely have at least one OTT subscription service. Other important segments consist of households with children and frequent travelers looking for the ability to download and watch blockbuster theatricals, STARZ original series and favorite TV and movies without an internet connection.
Affiliation agreements
Our Starz Networks’ services are distributed pursuant to affiliation agreements with Distributors (primarily MVPDs). These agreements require delivery of programming that meets certain standards. We earn revenue under these agreements either (i) based on the total number of subscribers who receive our services multiplied by rates specified in the affiliation agreements or (ii) based on amounts or rates which are not tied solely to the total number of subscribers who receive our services. Our affiliation agreements expire at various dates through 2022.
We work with Distributors to increase the number of subscribers to our Starz Networks’ services. To accomplish this, we may help fund the Distributors’ efforts to market these services or may permit Distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. We believe these efforts enhance our relationship with Distributors, improve the awareness of our services and ultimately increase subscribers and revenue over the term of these affiliation agreements. 
Distributors report the number of subscribers to our services and pay for services, generally, on a monthly basis. The agreements are generally structured to be multi-year agreements with staggered expiration dates and generally provide for annual contractual rate increases of a fixed percentage or a fixed amount, or rate increases tied to annual increases in the Consumer Price Index.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, revenue earned under Starz Networks’ affiliation agreements combined with revenue earned under other Lionsgate agreements with AT&T (including DIRECTV) accounted for at least 10% of Lionsgate's revenue.
OTT service
The STARZ app is the single destination for both Distributor authenticated and direct OTT subscribers to stream or download our Starz Networks’ original series and movie content. The STARZ app:

• | Is available on a wide array of platforms and devices;


• | Includes on-demand streaming and downloadable access to our Starz Networks’ content in a single destination app;


• | Offers instant access to approximately 7,500 selections each month (including original series and commercial free movies);


• | Is available for purchase as a standalone OTT service for $8.99/month; and


• | Is available as an additional benefit to paying MVPD subscribers of the Starz Networks’ linear premium services.

Output and Content License Agreements
The majority of content on our Starz Networks’ services consists of movies that have been released theatrically. Starz Networks has an exclusive long-term output licensing agreement with Sony for all qualifying movies released theatrically in the U.S. by studios owned by Sony through December 31, 2021. The Sony agreement, which began in 2001, includes all titles released under the Columbia, Screen Gems, Sony Pictures Classics and TriStar labels. Starz Networks does not license movies produced by Sony Pictures Animation. Under this agreement, Starz Networks has valuable exclusive rights to air new movies on linear television services, on-demand or online during two separate windows over a period of approximately three to seven years from their initial theatrical release. Generally, except on a VOD or pay-per-view basis, no other linear service, online streaming or other video service may air or stream these recent releases during Starz Networks’ windows, and no other premium subscription service may air or stream these releases between the two windows.
Starz Networks also licenses library content comprised of older, previously released theatrical movies from many of Hollywood’s major studios. In addition to theatrical movies, Starz Networks licenses made for television movies, television series and other content from studios, production companies or other rights holders. The rights agreements for library content are of varying duration and generally permit Starz Networks’ services to exhibit these movies, series and other programming during certain window periods.

The Sony output agreement requires Starz Networks to pay for movies at rates calculated on a pricing grid that is based on each film’s domestic box office performance (subject to maximum amounts payable per movie and a cap on the number of movies that can be put to Starz Networks each year). The amounts Starz Networks pays for library content vary based on each specific agreement, but generally reflect an amount per movie, series or other programming commensurate with the quality (e.g., utility and perceived popularity) of the content being licensed.
Original programming
Starz Networks produces and contracts with independent production companies and our Television Production operating segment to produce original programming that appears on our Starz Networks’ services. These contractual arrangements can provide Starz Networks with:

• | Outright ownership of the programming, in which case we wholly-own the series and receive all distribution and other rights to the content;


• | An exclusive U.S. pay television license and other distribution or ancillary rights covering specific territories for specified periods of time; or


• | An exclusive U.S. pay television license which provides for the programming to appear only on Starz Networks’ services for specified periods of time.

Transmission
We uplink our programming to four non-preemptible, protected transponders on two satellites positioned in geo-synchronous orbit. These satellites feed our signals to various swaths of the Americas. We lease these transponders under long-term lease agreements. These transponder leases have termination dates in 2023. We transmit to these satellites from our uplink center in Englewood, Colorado. We have made arrangements at a third party facility to uplink our linear channels to these satellites in the event we are unable to do so from our uplink center.
Regulatory Matters
In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) regulates broadcasters, the providers of satellite communications services and facilities for the transmission of programming services, the cable television systems and other Distributors that distribute such services, and, to some extent, the availability of the programming services themselves through its regulation of program licensing. Cable television systems in the U.S. are also regulated by municipalities or other state and local government authorities. Although cable television systems are subject to federal rate regulation on the provision of basic service, such regulation is limited to those local franchise authorities that have made an affirmative showing that there is no 
19

effective competition in the community. Very few franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification. Nonetheless, other franchise conditions could place downward pressure on the fees cable television companies are willing or able to pay for programming services, and regulatory carriage requirements also could adversely affect the number of channels available to carry our networks.
Regulation of Carriage of Broadcast Stations
The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (“1992 Cable Act”) granted broadcasters a choice of must carry rights or retransmission consent rights. The rules adopted by the FCC generally provide for mandatory carriage by cable systems of all local full-power commercial television broadcast signals selecting must carry rights and, depending on a cable system’s channel capacity, non-commercial television broadcast signals. Such statutorily mandated carriage of broadcast stations coupled with the provisions of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which require cable television systems with 36 or more “activated” channels to reserve a percentage of such channels for commercial use by unaffiliated third parties and permit franchise authorities to require the cable operator to provide channel capacity, equipment and facilities for public, educational and government access channels, could adversely affect our networks by limiting the carriage of our services in cable systems with limited channel capacity.
Closed Captioning
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 also required the FCC to establish rules to ensure that video programming is fully accessible to the hearing impaired through closed captioning. The rules adopted by the FCC require substantial closed captioning, with only limited exemptions. In 2012, the FCC adopted regulations pursuant to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 that require, among other things, video programming owners to send caption files for Internet protocol (“IP”) delivered video programming to video programming distributors and providers along with program files. In 2014, the FCC adopted closed captioning quality standards for captioning accuracy, synchronicity, completeness and placement and captioning best practices for programmers. In 2016, the FCC amended its closed captioning requirements to make programmers jointly responsible with distributors for captioning compliance, and to adopt certain registration, certification and complaint procedures applicable to programmers. The video programmer registration and compliance certification requirements of the amended rules have not yet become effective. As a result of these captioning requirements, our networks may incur additional costs for closed captioning.
Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (“CALM”) Act
Congress enacted the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (“CALM”) Act in 2010. The CALM Act directs the FCC to incorporate into its rules and make mandatory a technical standard that is designed to prevent digital television commercial advertisements from being transmitted at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. The FCC’s CALM Act implementing regulations became effective in 2012. Although the FCC’s CALM Act regulations place the primary compliance responsibility on Distributors, the FCC’s “safe harbor” compliance approach, which requires programmers to issue “widely available” CALM Act compliance certifications to Distributors, effectively shifts much of that responsibility to programmers.
Copyright Regulation
We are required to obtain any necessary music performance rights from the rights holders. These rights generally are controlled by the music performance rights organizations of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) and the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC), each with rights to the music of various artists.
Satellites and Uplink
In general, authorization from the FCC must be obtained for the construction and operation of a communications satellite. The FCC authorizes utilization of satellite orbital slots assigned to the U.S. by the World Radio communication Conference. Such slots are finite in number, thus limiting the number of carriers that can provide satellite transponders and the number of transponders available for transmission of programming services. At present, however, there are numerous competing satellite service providers that make transponders available for video services. The FCC also regulates the earth stations uplinking to and/or downlinking from such satellites.
Program Access
20

Because overlapping attributable interests continue to exist between us and entities owning cable systems, we remain subject to the FCC’s program access and antidiscrimination rules. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing regulations generally prohibit a cable operator that has an attributable interest in a satellite programmer from improperly influencing the terms and conditions of sale to unaffiliated Distributors. Further, the 1992 Cable Act requires that such affiliated programmers make their programming services available to cable operators and competing Distributors on terms and conditions that do not unfairly discriminate among Distributors. The FCC’s program licensing rules establish a damages remedy in situations where the defendant knowingly violates the regulations and a timeline for the resolution of complaints, among other things. As part of the FCC’s 2008 order approving the acquisition by Liberty Media Corporation (now known as Qurate Retail, Inc.) (“Liberty Media”) of a controlling interest in DIRECTV, the FCC imposed program access conditions on Liberty Media and its affiliated entities, which remain applicable to Starz. Under this order, as amended by the FCC’s October 5, 2012 order allowing the general restrictions on exclusive contracts to expire, we also are required to make our programming services available to all Distributors on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions.
Online Services
To the extent that our programming services are distributed through online based platforms, we must comply with various federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. Congress and individual states may consider additional legislation addressing online privacy and other issues.
Proposed Changes in Regulation

The regulation of programming services, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite providers, broadcast television licensees and online distributed services is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux historically. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.
Starz Networks’ Strategy
Our Starz Networks’ mission is to be a leading global entertainment brand providing powerful and immersive experiences. To that end, our goal is to provide Distributors and subscribers with high-quality, differentiated premium video services available on multiple viewing platforms. Starz Networks focuses on the following strategic goals:

• | Deliver engaging, brand building, premium original programming. We believe this is the most effective path to building a differentiated STARZ brand, which resonates with our Distributors and subscribers. Targeting underserved audiences (e.g., African American, Latino, LGBTQIA, female) will continue to be a core pillar of our Starz Networks’ original programming content strategy. As a result, our subscribers will have a regular opportunity to see a new episode of a STARZ original series or a new season of an existing STARZ original series on its flagship STARZ service throughout the year.


• | Create compelling consumer offerings. We intend to ensure that our Starz Networks’ services are available in formats and platforms that meet the needs of our Distributors as well as subscribers. We seek to monetize the digital rights we control for our Starz Networks’ exclusive original series and those under our programming licensing agreements with Hollywood studios by licensing the digital rights to Starz Networks’ services to our traditional distributors and online video providers as well as using these rights for the STARZ app.


• | Expand the STARZ brand and business in new international markets. In addition to STARZ PLAY Arabia (see Joint Ventures, Partnerships and Ownership Interests below), we will continue to look for other opportunities in international markets (such as our exclusive, long term alliance with Bell Media to bring Starz to Canada) to enhance our Starz Networks' brand and ultimately grow this business. 

We believe that this strategy, combined with a proven management team, positions Starz Networks for continued success. We look forward to making our Starz Networks services “must haves” for subscribers and a meaningful margin driver for our Distributors, thereby driving value for our stockholders.
Media Networks - Content and Other
Content and other revenues for our Media Networks segment are derived from the licensing of Starz original programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, through packaged media and other ancillary markets. 
21

Media Networks - Streaming Services
Streaming services represent revenues derived from the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming service initiatives on SVOD platforms including PANTAYA and Tribeca Shortlist.

PANTAYA, our joint venture with Hemisphere Media Group, is the first-ever premium streaming destination for world-class movies in Spanish offering the largest selection of current and classic, commercial-free blockbusters and critically acclaimed titles from Latin America and the U.S. 
Tribeca Shortlist, our joint venture with Tribeca Enterprises, is a premium SVOD service that features a high-quality collection of handpicked films that are recommended by popular actors, directors, insiders and influencers who know and love movies, including major studio releases and independent studio gems, foreign film favorites and documentaries.

JOINT VENTURES, PARTNERSHIPS AND OWNERSHIP INTERESTS
Our joint ventures, partnerships and ownership interests support our strategy of being multiplatform global industry leader in entertainment. We regularly evaluate our existing properties, libraries and other assets and businesses in order to determine whether they continue to enhance our competitive position in the industry, have the potential to generate significant long-term returns, represent an optimal use of our capital and are aligned with our goals. When appropriate, we discuss potential strategic transactions with third parties for purchase of our properties, libraries or other assets or businesses that factor into these evaluations. As a result, we may, from time to time, determine to sell individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses or enter into additional joint ventures, strategic transactions and similar arrangements for individual properties, libraries or other assets or businesses.

Laugh Out Loud. In March 2016, we entered into a partnership with Kevin Hart and Hartbeat Digital to launch Laugh Out Loud, a comedy brand and multi-platform network that serves as the exclusive home for all content created by Kevin Hart. 
Next Games. In July 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership and acquired an interest in Next Games, a mobile game developer and publisher specializing in service-based games based on entertainment franchises, such as movies, television series or books. 
Pantelion Films. In September 2010, we launched Pantelion Films, a joint venture with Videocine, an affiliate of Televisa, which produces, acquires and distributes a slate of English and Spanish language feature films that target Hispanic moviegoers in the U.S. 
Pilgrim Media Group. In November 2015, we acquired an interest in Craig Piligian’s Pilgrim Media Group, which boasts an unscripted programming slate with more than 20 programs in production and over 40 projects in active development. 

23


Pop. Entered into in March 2013, Pop is our joint venture with CBS Corporation. The partnership combines CBS’s programming, production and marketing assets with Lionsgate’s resources in motion pictures, television and digitally delivered content. 
Potboiler Television. In December 2016, Lionsgate UK acquired an interest in Potboiler Television, a UK television drama company that develops and produces thought-provoking and entertaining films and television dramas, stories which have meaning, resonance, integrity and heart. 
Primal Media. In July 2016, Lionsgate UK acquired an interest in Primal Media, a production company that develops and produces unscripted programs in the UK, and works with Lionsgate's alternative programming team in the U.S. to produce U.S. formats for the UK market. 
Roadside Attractions. In July 2007, we acquired an interest in Roadside Attractions, an independent theatrical distribution company. 
STARZ PLAY Arabia. Launched in 2015, STARZ PLAY Arabia is a personalized OTT entertainment service that operates in 19 Middle East/North African countries. STARZ PLAY Arabia offers a deep selection of Hollywood movies and television series with English, Arabic and French language options, along with local Arabic and Bollywood content.
Telltale Games. In February 2015, we acquired an interest in Telltale Games, an award-winning independent developer and publisher of digital entertainment. 

Intellectual Property
We currently use and own or license a number of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property in connection with our businesses and own registrations and applications to register them both domestically and internationally. We believe that ownership of, and/or the right to use, such trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and similar intellectual property is an important factor in our businesses and that our success does depends, in part, on such ownership.
Motion picture and television piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of content into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of content on packaged media and through digital formats. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of these products has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, because these products reduce the revenue we receive from our products. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.
24

Competition
Our motion picture production and distribution, television programming and syndication and premium pay television networks businesses (as well as home entertainment, global distribution and sales, interactive ventures and games and location-based entertainment business) operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with companies within the entertainment and media business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation and other cultural related activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television production companies, television networks, pay television services and digital media platforms for the acquisition of literary and film properties, the services of performing artists, directors, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our entertainment businesses. In addition, our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies. Likewise, our television product faces significant competition from independent distributors as well as major studios. Moreover, our networks compete with other programming networks for viewing and subscribership by each distributor’s customer base. As a result, the success of any of our motion picture, television or networks business is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular film or program, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time as well as on the ability to license and produce content for the networks that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory subscriber levels.
Given such competition, we attempt to operate with a different business model than others. We typically emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative entertainment content to serve diverse audiences worldwide.
Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement
Lionshares
We are committed to acting responsibly and making a positive difference in the local and global community through Lionshares, the umbrella for our companywide commitment to our communities.
