Our Strategy
 
Today, more and more companies are seeking to connect their machines and electronic devices to the Internet, to manage them remotely, and to create new business models. The growth in the IoT market is being driven by the growing importance of data, and the rapidly falling cost of sensors, connectivity, computing and storage. While the promise of IoT is great, many companies find designing and deploying an IoT project to be complex, costly and time-consuming.
 
Our strategy is to leverage our networking and software development expertise to develop technologies that make it easier for our customers to participate in the IoT. We are primarily focused on the following market transitions:
 

· | the increasing role of wireless networks for IoT communication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the desire to remotely access, monitor and manage machines and IT infrastructure assets; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the increasing importance of security in IoT deployments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
We are addressing the IoT market opportunity and the transitions above with a combination of hardware and software solutions that will combine our portfolio of robust and secure networking technologies with new advanced data access, management, and security features for industrial IoT assets. Our offerings are designed to help companies to simplify and speed their IoT deployments, reduce complexity and development costs associated with web-scale application development and assist them in creating value-added business models.
 
We have continued to dedicate significant engineering resources to our MACH10® management software platform and ready-to-use applications that are intended to address the markets’ need for cloud-based centralized management of IoT and IT assets. During the past fiscal year, we introduced a number of ready-to-use applications as well as software-as-a-service, or SaaS, offerings for both IoT and IT product lines, including Lantronix Gateway Central, MACH10 Global Device Manager, and ConsoleFlowTM. Lantronix Gateway Central is a cloud-based SaaS offering that allows device manufacturers, system integrators and end users to remotely monitor and manage deployed Lantronix IoT Gateways (which are further described below). MACH10 Global Device Manager is a ready-to-use industrial IoT application that enables device manufacturers to integrate IoT device lifecycle management for remote monitoring and management for their connected devices. ConsoleFlow is a centralized IT infrastructure management and monitoring software optimized for out-of-band networks, designed to provide network resilience and ensure connectivity even when primary connections fail – and especially in data centers and at remote sites where network availability is essential to business continuity. These software offerings are in the early stages of evaluation and did not generate revenue during fiscal 2018.

Products and Solutions
 
We organize our products and solutions into three product lines: IoT, IT Management and Other.
 
IoT
 
Our IoT products typically connect to one or more existing machines, or are built into new industrial devices to provide network connectivity. Our products are designed to enhance the value and utility of machines by making the data from the machines available to users, systems and processes or by controlling their properties and features over the network.
 
Our IoT products currently consist of IoT Gateways and IoT Building Blocks. IoT Gateways are designed to provide secure connectivity and the ability to add integrated device management and advanced data access features. IoT Building Blocks provide basic secure machine connectivity and unmanaged data access.
 
Our IoT products may be embedded into new designs or attached to existing machines. Our IoT products include wired and wireless connections that enhance the value and utility of modern electronic systems and equipment by providing secure network connectivity, application hosting, protocol conversion, secure access for distributed IoT deployments and many other functions. Many of the products are offered with software tools intended to further accelerate our customer’s time-to-market and increase their value add.
 
Most of our IoT products are pre-certified in a number of countries thereby significantly reducing our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers’ regulatory certification costs and accelerating their time to market.
 
The following product families are included in our IoT product line: EDS, EDS-MD, PremierWave® EN, PremierWave® XC, SGX™, UDS, WiPort®, xDirect®, xPico®, xPico® Wi-Fi, xPress™, XPort®, MACH10® Global Device Manager and Lantronix Gateway Central.
 
IT Management
 
Today, organizations are managing an ever-increasing number of devices and data on enterprise networks where 24/7 reliability is mission critical. Out-of-band management is a technique that uses a dedicated management network to access critical network devices to ensure management connectivity (including the ability to determine the status of any network component) independent of the status of other in-band network components. Remote out-of-band access allows organizations to effectively manage their enterprise IT resources and at the same time, optimize their IT support resources. Our vSLM™, a virtualized central management software solution, simplifies secure administration of our IT management products and the equipment attached to them through a standard web browser.
 
Our IT Management product line includes console management, power management, and keyboard-video-mouse (commonly referred to as a KVM) products that provide remote access to IT and networking infrastructure deployed in test labs, data centers, branch offices and server rooms.
 
The following product families are included in our IT Management product line: SLB™, SLC™ 8000, Spider™, ConsoleFlow and vSLM™.
 
Other
 
We categorize products that are non-focus or end-of-life as Other. Our Other product line includes non-focus products such as the xPrintServer®. In addition, this product line includes end-of-life versions of our MatchPort®, SLC™, SLP™, xPress Pro, xSenso®, PremierWave® XN, and WiBox product families.
 
Net Revenue by Product Line
 
We have one operating and reportable business segment. A summary of our net revenue by product line is found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Sales Cycle
 
Our embedded IoT solutions are typically used by OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and contract manufacturers. OEMs design and sell products under their own brand that are either manufactured by the OEM in-house or by third-party contract manufacturers. ODMs design and manufacture products for third parties, which then sell those products under the third parties’ brands. The design cycles using our embedded solutions typically range from nine to 24 months and can generate revenue for the entire life-cycle of an end user’s product.
 
Our IT Management product line and external IoT solutions are typically sold to end users through value added resellers, or VARs, systems integrators, distributors, online retailers and, to a lesser extent, OEMs. The design cycles for our IT Management products generally range from three to 18 months and are often project-based.
 
Sales Channels
 
Distributors
 
A majority of our sales are made through distributors. Distributors resell our products to a wide variety of resellers and end customers including OEMs, ODMs, VARs, systems integrators, consumers, online retailers, IT resellers, corporate customers and government entities.
Resellers
 
Our products are sold by industry-specific system integrators and VARs, who often obtain our products from our distributors. Additionally, our products are sold by direct market resellers such as CDW, ProVantage, and Amazon.com.
Direct Sales
 
We sell many products directly to larger OEMs and end users. We also maintain an ecommerce site for direct sales.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products primarily through an internal sales force, which includes regional sales managers, inside sales personnel and field applications engineers in major regions throughout the world. This team manages our relationships with our partners and end users, identifies and develops new sales opportunities and increases penetration at existing accounts. We implement marketing programs, tools and services, including displaying our products at industry-specific events, to generate sales leads and increase demand for our products.
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing operations are primarily conducted through third-party contract manufacturers. We utilize AsteelFlash Group and Hana Microelectronics, both primarily located in China, as our contract manufacturers for most of our products. In addition, we use eSilicon Corporation to manage Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., a third-party foundry located in Taiwan, which manufactures our large-scale integration chips. We manufacture certain products with final assembly in the U.S. to meet trade compliance requirements.
 
Our contract manufacturers source raw materials, components and integrated circuits, in accordance with our specifications and forecasts, and perform printed circuit board assembly, final assembly, functional testing and quality control. Our products are manufactured and tested to our specifications with standard and custom components. Many of these components are available from multiple vendors. However, we have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us.
