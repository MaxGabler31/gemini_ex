ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
We are a commercial stage biotechnology acceleration and development company focused on acquiring and in-licensing pre-clinical, clinical-stage and approved life sciences therapeutic products. We aim to acquire, or license and have assembled, a pipeline of multiple therapeutics in development stages ranging from early pre-clinical to commercial ready. Our model seeks to diversify risk by broadening the therapeutic areas we work in as well as providing multiple catalysts as we advance assets through the clinical and regulatory process. We aim to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on multiple assets throughout the discovery and development cycle as well as commercial product revenue generation. We expect to benefit from early positioning in illiquid and/or less well known privately-held assets, thereby enabling us to capitalize on valuation growth as these assets move forward in their development.
​
Currently, we have a portfolio of five therapeutic products, including an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical for metastatic bone cancer pain (Strontium-89 and MetastronTM) and three development stage products: QBM-001 for rare pediatric non-verbal autism spectrum disorder, Uttroside-B for liver cancer, and the MANNIN Platform starting with MAN19 for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by infectious diseases like COVID19. The MANNIN platform has several potential therapeutics in development in various indications, including vascular (glaucoma, Cystic kidney disease) and infectious diseases. The infectious diseases we may ultimately treat include influenza, COVID-19, Ebola and others.
​
In 2020, we began generating revenue from our Strontium-89 product for pain palliation in bone metastases. We are exploring a therapeutic expansion post-marketing clinical trials or data aggregation for Strontium-89. We also intend to file investigational new drug applications or equivalent in 2022 with the Canadian regulators for MAN-19 for Acute Respiratory Diseases Syndrome (caused by COVID-19) and later in the United States for Uttroside-B for the treatment of liver cancer. Additional Mannin indications will also be advanced towards clinical trials for other vascular diseases. We also intend to advance our QBM-001 asset to address a non-verbal learning disorder in autistic children and are assessing additional technologies to focus our pipeline in the rare disease space to complement our orphan drug designated liver cancer drug candidate and the rare autism spectrum program.
​
Following is a summary of our product pipeline.
​
Our Strategy
​
Our goal is to become a leading biotechnology acceleration and development company with a diversified portfolio of therapeutic products and product candidates. To achieve this goal, we are executing on the following strategy:
​

● | Strategically collaborate or in- and out-license select programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

We seek to collaborate or in- and out-license certain potentially therapeutic candidate products to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization.

● | Highly leverage external talent and resources.
--+-----------------------------------------------

We plan to maintain and further build our team which is skilled in evaluating technologies for development and product development towards commercialization. By partnering with industry specific experts, we are able to identify undervalued assets that we can fund and assist in enhancing inherent value. We plan to continue to rely on the extensive experience of our management team to execute on our objectives.

● | Evaluate commercialization and monetization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate’s commercialization or monetization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing any product that we develop by ourselves or jointly with another party, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets such product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is too early for us to know which of these options we will pursue for our drug candidates, assuming their successful development.





● | Acquire commercially or near-commercially ready products and build out the current market for such.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to acquiring pre-clinical products, in assembling a diversified portfolio of healthcare assets, we plan on acquiring assets that are either FDA approved or are reasonably expected to be FDA approved within 12 months of our acquiring them. We anticipate hiring a contract sales organization to assume the bulk of the sales and distribution efforts related to any such product.
​

------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Research and Development Activities
​
As a biomedical acceleration and development company, research and development is a core aspect of our business. In the fiscal years ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred approximately $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in research and development activities.
​
Metastron™ and Strontium-89 Chloride USP Injection
​
We have been working hard to commercialize Strontium-89 for the non-opiate treatment of metastatic cancer bone pain. In November 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services approved our supplemental abbreviated new drug application for a new drug product manufacturing site, IsoTherapeutics Group, LLC. In 2020, IsoTherapeutics began manufacturing our FDA approved non-opioid cancer bone pain drug Strontium-89 Chloride USP.
​
On February 13, 2020, we launched our FDA approved non-opioid drug Strontium-89 (Strontium Chloride Sr-89 Injection, USP). In January 2021, we received full reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid, were approved as a federal supplier in March 2021, and engaged a federal sales team working mostly with the U.S Departments of Veterans’ Affairs, the Department of Defense and Indian Health Services. We have recently retained Eversana to partner on the institutional sales efforts and expect to deploy in field sales reps in 2022. Stontium-89 has been shown to relieve the persistent pain associated with cancer that has metastasized to bone. In several multicenter, placebo-controlled trials in cancer patients with persistent pain after external beam radiation therapy for bone metastases, pain relief occurred in more patients treated with a single injection of Strontium-89 than in patients treated with an injection of placebo, with a greater percentage of patients experiencing pain scores of zero with no use of rescue opioid analgesics. Median duration of pain palliation has been shown to be 2 to 5 months. Strontium-89 can be re-dosed every 90 days.
​
An estimated 10 million people are living with this condition, and due to the opioid crisis, doctors and patients are looking for an alternative to treat metastatic cancer associated bone pain. Given that Strontium-89 can be administered every three months and has proven effective in approximately 80% of the patients who received the drug, Q BioMed is hopeful that a broad market is available and can be accessed with the right resources.
​



We have a Non-USA named patient program and few international distribution contracts in place expect to be able to generate sales outside the US this year. Through our US distribution partner, Jubilant RadiopharmaTM, we have the capability to reach patients in all 50 states. Our contract manufacturing facility, which is FDA approved to manufacture Strontium-89, is manufacturing commercial-scale quantities on a regular schedule. COVID-19 restrictions on people and supply chains have slowed our commercial rollout to some extent. We are fully commercial in terms of product availability, infrastructure and distribution and expect to have a meaningful sales team deployed during 2022 once funding is available.
​
We plan to launch the Strontium-89 in global markets, including Europe, in 2022 as we navigate the regulatory approval process, and we have already seen interest from this region. With the necessary funding, we also plan to undertake further research for Strontium-89 for potential label extension into therapeutic use for survival benefit in metastatic bone cancer through a Phase IV study as well as to explore combination studies for enhancing the value proposition of the drug through better outcomes.
​
We have proactively on-boarded our commercial team tasked with infrastructure set-up, including medical information and pharmacovigilance, government contracting, marketing and a contract federal sales team. We have announced a distribution partnership with Jubilant Radiopharma who have all the capabilities we require to access the U.S. market, including warehousing/inventory management, invoicing and customer service/ordering. Jubilant also has a sales team that calls on major providers, a national network of nuclear pharmacies in the United States and distribution and coverage throughout the United States.
​
The global demand for access to generic drugs and non-opioid therapies has given Q BioMed access to a global market we continue to be extremely excited about its prospects to re-establish a deserved niche in the late stage cancer treatment landscape.
​
Mannin Research Inc. Intellectual Property
​
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement, as amended in March 2019, with Mannin Research Inc. (Mannin) whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive license on, and option to acquire, certain Mannin intellectual property, or IP, within a four-year term. Under the 2019 amendment, the option to acquire was extended to October 29, 2021 and is now expired. On September 1, 2020, we further amended the license agreement allowing Mannin to grant an exclusive license to Mannin GmbH (its wholly owned German subsidiary) in order fully take advantage of the German government grant to Mannin. The agreement also confirms our ongoing investment into the Tie2 platform to create, and therefore maintain economic value for us and our shareholders. We have agreed to contribute funds in Mannin GmbH. We paid Mannin $1.5 million in cash in three instalments. In addition, we paid to Mannin $0.75 million in shares of our common stock valued as of June 15, 2020, in full satisfaction of R&D payables, contracted by Mannin in development of the Tie2 platform. We continue to have the right to 100% of the revenues, if any, derived from the Mannin Tie2 technology platform, until such time that Mannin and its subsidiaries have independently raised at least $2 million in funds, at which time the parties have agreed to a 50% profit share structure reducing our future capital commitments to Mannin R&D and commercial rollout, which is expected to happen this year.
​
The Mannin IP and Tie2 platform technology was initially focused on developing a first-in-class eye drop treatment for glaucoma, but was shifted in 2020 to quickly advance a therapeutic for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes the most severe COVID19 infections to require intubation, ICU and poor outcomes. The technology platform is being expanded and development is underway for ophthalmological uses and also includes other indications in cystic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and other infectious disease. This platform technology has application in many disease states that result in ‘leaky’ vessels and the inefficient flow of fluids, like COVID-19. During the years ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, we respectively incurred approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million of research and development expenses under our license with Mannin. The purchase price for the Mannin IP is $30.0 million less the amount of cash paid by us for development and the value of the Common Stock issued to the vendor. We can make this all or part of this payment in stock, provided that such stock does not represent 15% or more of our issued and outstanding Common Stock.
​
Mannin COVID-19, Glaucoma and Others – More Government Funding
​
In March 2021, Mannin Research Inc. was granted an additional CAD$1.7 million from the Canadian governments COVID response budget, adding to the approximate $7.7 million granted in Europe, which together will fund 65-75 percent of every dollar incurred to advance the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome therapy for COVID patients as well as a portfolio of therapeutic assets for vascular diseases currently in development at Mannin, including: glaucoma, cardiovascular diseases, acute kidney disease, and other infectious diseases.
​



The MAN-19 therapeutic is a recombinant fusion protein that treats the patient, instead of targeting the virus. It is not a cure for COVID-19, but it strengthens a patient’s blood vessels and protects them against ARDS, breathing problems, sepsis and other infections that may cause the body’s organs to begin shutting down. It is designed to keep COVID-19 patients out of the ICU and off a ventilator. Initial manufacturing and preclinical testing has shown promise, and pending upcoming toxicology testing, the drug is poised for clinical trials to start in 2022. If the drug proves both safe and effective, our goal is to have it available for use by patients by early 2023.
​
Our next steps are to complete the final toxicology studies, data aggregation and achieve approval of a Phase 1 clinical trial. The market for this kind of treatment in the current pandemic climate is substantial and global. COVID-19 is not going away any time soon. As a result, there is a need to develop more effective treatments. We believe that this technology will play a role in the broader treatment landscape and not only for COVID-19, but also for other infectious diseases that cause ARDS.
​
MAN-01 and GDF15
​
There are over 60 million patients worldwide with primary open-angle glaucoma. MAN-01 aims to reduce the pressure build-up in the eye by assisting with, and correcting, drainage problems in tiny vessels in the eye called the Schlemm’s Canal. MAN-01 is being designed to target these unique and extremely important vessels, as over 70% of all fluid in the eye flows through the Schlemm’s Canal. Currently, the MAN-01 program is finalizing its preclinical lead candidate optimization by completing a series of ophthalmic in vivo studies to demonstrate efficacy. After successful completion of the in vivo studies, Mannin Research will begin preparing for preclinical toxicology and filing of its IND. Our research shows that the drug’s mechanism of action may ameliorate vessel damage in several other diseases such as: kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and against infectious diseases, such as influenza and the current COVID-19 outbreak. We believe these programs comprise a multi-disease platform technology that has several valuable applications. Adding the GDF15 biomarker to our portfolio is a significant step to securing a unique product offering that put precision medicine and patient specific treatment in the hands of clinicians. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a companion diagnostic marker to the MAN-01 drug for determining the severity of glaucoma using the expression levels of GDF15. Determining the severity of glaucoma using this biomarker will aid in treatment decisions for patients diagnosed with, and being treated for, glaucoma. Recent buyouts in the Biotechnology space has us believing that large pharma companies could be looking for valuable assets like this with multiple downlines because of expiring patient protection on current drugs. Our collaborators at the Washington University in St. Louis are currently examining the effectiveness of GDF15 as a clinical biomarker in a clinical trial. In parallel, Q BioMed and Mannin Research are working with the Biointerfaces Institute at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada to develop a GDF15 biomarker diagnostic kit for monitoring glaucoma severity and progression. The aim is to develop a simple integrated diagnostic test that can be performed at a physician’s office with no external, expensive equipment.
​
The MAN Platform for other indications:
​
Mannin presented positive data on a potential new treatment for acute kidney injury (AKI) at the American Society of Nephrology’s annual meeting held on November 7, 2019 in Washington DC.
​
The data presented demonstrates the Ang-Tie2 signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic target for renal protection from acute kidney injury following ischemic reperfusion. Ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury to the kidney occurs in a range of clinically important scenarios including hypotension, sepsis and in surgical procedures such as cardiac bypass surgery and kidney transplantation, leading to AKI. In-hospital mortality for patients with AKI has recently been estimated to be between 20 and 25% and mortality rates in excess of 50% have been reported in critically ill patients with AKI requiring dialysis. For those patients who survive, complications include chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); cardiovascular events, and reduced quality of life. In the United States, AKI is associated with an increase in hospitalization costs that range from $5.4 to $24.0 billion.  No effective treatments have been approved by the FDA. This represents a very significant opportunity to advance a therapeutic in an underserved patient population.
​
ASD-002
​
On April 21, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement on Patent & Know-How Technology with ASDERA whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive, license on certain ASDERA intellectual property, which was previously referred to as ASD-002 in our pipeline, and was intended to treat Disruption of Active Language Development (DALD) in toddlers developing Autism Spectrum Disorders. Under that agreement, we paid ASDERA $50,000 and issued 125,000 shares of our Common Stock. On November 27, 2019, we notified ASDERA that we considered the agreement to have been rescinded retroactively as of April 21, 2017. As a result of such rescission, we believe that we have no continuing material obligations to ASDERA. However, we will continue to develop unique technologies for the benefit of underserved patient populations.




​
QBM-001
​
Among the more than 60,000 US children who develop autism spectrum disorders, or ASD, every year, approximately 20,000 become nonverbal and will have to rely on assisted living for the rest of their lives. In parallel to ASD-002, we have been developing a product, QBM-001, intended to treat the rare condition - pediatric minimally verbal autism. Many of the children who miss this potential treatment window between the age of 2 and 5 years old may become non-verbal for the rest of their lives. Currently, there is no treatment for this rare disorder.
​
QBM-001 is not intended to treat other ASDs or to be used beyond the specific group and the estimated treatment window. The “treatment window” results from independent research that revealed a decreased density in the cortex region of the brain in minimally verbal children with autism, who were 7 years of age. A biomarker study performed by us has directed us to conclude that QBM-001 cannot be used for other autistic groups. The study analyzed over 2000 known autistic markers and found two distinct biomarkers for children with pediatric minimally verbal autism. The biomarkers did not overlap with the high functioning group of autistic children, nor the intermediate group, which struggles with, but develops limited language. The biomarkers gave us insight into what was wrong with the children and has given us unique insight on how to ameliorate their condition with the goal of helping them develop the ability to speak.
​
The biomarker study also led us to evaluate and identify a rat model that contains the biomarkers and is thus a good model to test QBM-001. In addition, we have access to cell lines from deceased children who had pediatric minimally verbal autism. QBM-001 consists of a combination of products that target different mechanisms of action. Having the cell lines and rat model available to us provides us with an excellent preclinical path to validate the safety and efficacy of QBM-001.
​
We filed an orphan drug application for our QBM-001 drug candidate in June 2019. We need to supplement our application with additional data and intend on refiling the supplemented application in 2022.
​
QBM-001 - Addressing Rare Pediatric Minimally Verbal Autism
​
Causes of non-verbal learning disorder have been linked to several complications that range from a specific mutated gene as with Fragile X Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Phelan McDermid Syndrome or autoimmunity, where the body’s immune system is attacking parts of the brain. Trauma, microbial infections and environmental factors have also been linked to non-verbal learning disorder. Ongoing research is helping to further explain the root cause of why children become non-verbal or minimally verbal.
​
Cognitive intervention is the only form for treatment that has shown to help improve speech capability and social interaction in autistic children, however, with minimal benefit with children with pediatric minimally verbal autism. As intervention does not lead to speech progression, being minimally verbal carries a lifetime burden of over $5 million per person for cost of care. This is further compounded by additional expenses during the lifespan of the person due to loss in productivity in addition to severe emotional strain for the child and the parents.
​
As there are no treatment options for these patients, we believe there is a significant economic opportunity to bring a drug to market in this indication. The active ingredients in our compound are well known and have been approved by worldwide regulators for many years. Using a novel delivery and formulation for the ingredients, we intend to advance this drug through the 505(b)2 pathway.
​
RGCB and OMRF Intellectual Property
​
On June 15, 2017, we entered into a Technology License Agreement with RGCB and OMRF whereby they granted us a worldwide, exclusive, license on intellectual property related to Uttroside-B. Uttroside-B is a chemical compound derived from the plant Solanum nigrum Linn, also known as Black Nightshade or Makoi. We seek to use the Uttroside-B IP to create a chemotherapeutic agent against liver cancer.
​
The initial cost to acquire the exclusive license for Uttroside-B was $10,000. In addition to royalties based upon net sales of the product candidate, if any, we are required to make additional payments upon the following milestones:
​

● | the completion of certain preclinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | the filing of an investigational new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration or the filing of the equivalent application with an equivalent governmental agency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successful completion of each of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of the product candidate;
--+---------------------------------------


● | approval by the foreign equivalent of the FDA of the product candidate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieving certain worldwide net sales; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | a change of control of our Company.
--+------------------------------------

​
Subject to the terms of the exclusive license for Uttroside-B, we will be in control of the development and commercialization of the product candidate and are responsible for the costs of such development and commercialization. We are obligated to undertake a good-faith commitment to (i) fund the pre-clinical trials and (ii) to initiate a Phase II clinical trial within six years of the date of the Agreement. Failure to show a good-faith effort to meet those goals would mean that the exclusive license for Uttroside-B would revert to the licensors.
​
UTTROSIDE-B - A Novel Chemotherapeutic for Liver Cancer
​
The liver is the football-sized organ in the upper right area of the belly. Symptoms of liver cancer are uncommon in the early stages. Liver cancer treatments vary, but may include removal of part of the liver, liver transplant, chemotherapy, and in some cases radiation. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by birth defects, alcohol abuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis. In the United States, the average age at onset of liver cancer is 63 years. Men are more likely to develop liver cancer than women, by a ratio of 2 to 1.
​
There are currently few marketed drugs for the treatment of liver cancer. Sorafinib, a tryosine kinase inhibitor, is the first to market and market leader. Current sales of sorafinib are estimated at $1 billion per year.
​
Uttroside-B appears to affect phosphorylated JNK (pro survival signaling) and capcase activity (apoptosis in liver cancer). It is a natural compound fractionated Saponin derived from the Solarim Nigrum plant. It is a small molecule that showed in early investigation to increase the cytotoxicity of a variety of liver cancer cell types and importantly to be up to ten times more potent than Sorafenib in pre-clinical studies.
​
As it is not feasible to use the plant as the source for a drug, we successfully synthesized the molecule thereby creating an exact replica of the naturally occurring chemical compound. In a joint research program with India-based Chemveda Life Sciences in 2017, we initiated this very complex and challenging synthesis program. After 2 years, the exceptional chemists at Chemveda and our scientists, succeeded. The synthetic molecule has now been tested in comparison to the original plant molecule and the results confirm the same efficacy against the same liver cancer cell lines. We are now optimizing the synthesis of the molecule and are conducting free clinical testing on the initial output from that process and are preparing to advance this into a preclinical program. During the year ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, total fees paid to Chemveda Life Sciences was $65,000 and $0.2 million, respectively.
​
Note on COVID-19
​
To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially affected our Strontium-89 supply chain or production schedule, although a slight delay in supply chain is probable and expected. The Pandemic has impacted how patients and physicians interact and our ability to connect with our physician customers and clinic administrators and various government regulators was severely limited and has delayed our entry into the market.
​



With respect to COVID-19, we are working on developing a potential treatment. It is in the early stages of development but could prove to be an important tool in treating several infectious diseases that result in respiratory complications. Our technology partner and licensor, Mannin Research, has received requests from, and submitted responses to, governmental organizations worldwide and philanthropic groups for information about the potential use of its biologic treatment for COVID-19. The potential treatment is based on the understanding that vascular leakage is a key driver of organ injury in diseases such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by viruses, including COVID-19. The Angiopoietin-Tie2 signaling pathway for the treatment of vascular permeability associated with pulmonary edema from respiratory infections like COVID-19, but also ARDS, SARS, seasonal Influenzas and others. There were 45 million symptomatic flu cases, 810,000 hospitalizations and 61,000 deaths – in the United States alone during the 2017-2018 flu season, and that flu has resulted in 9 million – 41 million illnesses, 140,000 – 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 – 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020 according to the CDC. We are in the early stages of investigations and preclinical evaluation of this potential drug and hope to collaborate with others on a global basis to advance this program as rapidly as possible. COVID-19 variants continue to evolve and cause concern and demonstrate the need for a non-variant specific treatment. We also believe it could be utilized for seasonal influenzas and future similar pandemic viral threats
​
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
​
If products we acquire do not have adequate intellectual protection, we will take the necessary steps to protect our proprietary therapeutic product candidate assets and associated technologies that are important to our business consisting of seeking and maintaining domestic and international patents. These may cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. Our competitive position depends on our ability to obtain patents on our technologies and our potential products, to defend our patents, to protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets of others. We seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position.
​
We hold a license to all intellectual property related to our licensed the drug candidates. We own the intellectual property for our SR89, our generic Strontium-89 Chloride product candidate for metastatic cancer bone pain therapy, and MetastronTM, our branded Strontium-89 Chloride product candidate for metastatic cancer bone pain therapy. We are not subject to a license for QBM-001, the combination drug candidate related to a nonverbal disorder associated with autism.
​
We have applied for some patents in our own right. Most patents and applications are held in the licensors’ or inventors’ names and are assignable under license agreements to us.
​
Competition
​
We operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in the fields in which we research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.
​
Raw Materials and Third-Party Manufacturing
​
We began commercially producing our sole product, Strontium-89, in February 2020. To date, we have sourced all the raw material needed for Strontium-89 from Polatom in Poland. Due to the limited production of Strontium-89 to date, we do not consider it a substantial risk that we have only one supplier of this raw material. As we ramp up production, we are in the process of adding a US based supplier of the raw material, and are working through the regulatory approval required to formally add that raw material to our approved ANDA.




​
Likewise, Strontium-89 has been manufactured solely by IsoTherapeutics in Houston, Texas. Although we will continue to rely on them for the manufacture of Strontium-89, we do not currently have any intention of finding an additional manufacturer. Were our relationship with IsoTherapeutics to terminate or they were otherwise unable to manufacture Strontium-89, we would not be able to produce more Strontium-89 until a replacement FDA approved manufacturer is found.
​
Government Regulation
​
The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive approval of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) from the FDA. The process of obtaining BLA approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these products depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities (or those of third parties upon which we rely) are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.
​
The FDA or another regulatory agency can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:
​

● | the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;

​
With respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.
​
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
​
Federal, state, and international environmental laws may impose certain costs and restrictions on our business. We do not believe that we have spent or lost money due to these laws and regulations.
​



Product Liability and Insurance
​
We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and the eventual sale and use of any product candidates, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. We have product liability insurance in place at the time of product launch.
