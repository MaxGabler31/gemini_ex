Item 1. Business.
Overview
 References herein to “we,” “us,” “Company” and “Aduro” refer to Aduro Biotech, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states otherwise.
 We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that are designed to harness the body's natural immune system for the treatment of patients with challenging diseases. Our primary technologies related to the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) and A Proliferation Inducing Ligand (APRIL) pathways have led to what we believe is a strong pipeline of clinical candidates that are being investigated in cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our product candidates are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, particularly in combination with other novel immunotherapies. We are collaborating with a number of leading global pharmaceutical companies to help expand and drive our product pipeline. Our strategy is to rapidly advance best-in-class therapies from our STING and APRIL technologies through clinical development and regulatory approval.  
 Our STING pathway activator technology is designed to activate the intracellular STING receptor, which may result in a potent tumor-specific immune response. We are developing STING pathway activator product candidates, including ADU-S100 (MIW815), in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis. ADU-S100, the first STING pathway activator to enter the clinic, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial as a single agent and in an ongoing Phase 1b combination trial with spartalizumab (PDR001), an investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Preliminary results and observations from these trials were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 33rd Annual Meeting in November 2018. We also have initiated a Phase 1 trial of ADU-S100 in combination with YERVOY® (ipilimumab), an approved anti-CTLA-4 antibody for the treatment of relapsed and refractory melanoma. We expect to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ADU-S100 with an approved anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in the second half of 2019. 
APRIL 
is a soluble factor that binds to B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor, or TACI, receptors thereby inducing signaling, and is implicated in IgA nephropathy, multiple myeloma and other indications. BION-1301, a first-in-class fully blocking monoclonal antibody that blocks APRIL binding to both the BCMA and TACI receptors, is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for multiple myeloma. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of BION-1301 in healthy volunteers as part of our plan to evaluate BION-1301 in IgA nephropathy in the first half of 2019.
 In addition to our current STING pathway product candidates that activate the STING receptor, we are developing product candidates that are designed to prevent or control immune responses through the STING pathway as part of our cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor program. In December 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, for our cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor program for the research and development of novel inhibitor product candidates for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.
 We have intellectual property protection on our STING and APRIL technologies and each of our product candidates, some of which we believe can be maintained into 2039.
 Our Strategy
 We aim to discover, develop and commercialize therapies to treat challenging diseases based on our STING and APRIL pathway technologies. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Rapidly advance therapies from our STING and APRIL technologies through discovery, clinical development and regulatory approval. We are developing novel drug candidates by leveraging our proprietary technologies and understanding of the STING and APRIL pathways. We have proprietary technologies that we believe can generate novel and combinable therapies to target disease indications with significant unmet medical need.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand on the value of our product candidates through partnerships. We may decide to selectively partner product candidates in certain geographies and where we believe a partner could bring additional resources and expertise to maximize the value of our product candidates. We have strategic partnerships with Novartis for STING pathway activator product candidates in oncology, Lilly for cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor product candidates and Merck to advance an anti-CD27 antibody. We believe these partnerships have the potential to drive significant value through the extensive capabilities of these organizations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Maximize the value of our proprietary STING and APRIL pathway programs through the retention of commercial rights in key markets. We retain U.S. commercial rights for STING pathway activator product candidates in oncology developed in collaboration with Novartis. In addition, we maintain full ownership of our APRIL pathway product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the expertise of our scientific founders and key advisors to develop innovative technologies at the forefront of immunotherapy. Our scientific founders and advisors are from some of the world’s leading research institutions and have a history of seminal discoveries and significant experience in oncology and immunotherapy. As such, we plan to continue to leverage the collective talent of our scientists, clinicians and a network of highly influential advisors to inform our development strategy and enable our technology to be at the forefront of immunotherapy. We strive to protect our commercially important discoveries and product candidates by applying for, maintaining, and defending our patent rights.

Our Pipeline 

STING Pathway Technology 
 We believe key attributes of our STING pathway technology include:
  
• | Early Evidence of Potency. Our STING pathway activator product candidates have demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies as well as early clinical activity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel Mechanism. Our STING Pathway activator product candidates are designed to initiate broad and strong innate and adaptive immune responses through the activation of the STING receptor signaling pathway.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatility of Delivery. We believe our STING pathway activator product candidates can be delivered via intratumoral injection, and potentially via new systemic delivery formulations and other novel modalities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combinability. Based on their mechanism of action and results from preclinical studies and observations from early clinical studies, we believe our STING pathway activator product candidates may have synergistic or additive benefits of immune-mediated tumor killing mechanisms when combined with conventional and novel therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors, among others.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Manufacture. Our STING pathway activator product candidates are small molecules manufactured through a relatively simple and cost-effective process.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Applicability. We believe our STING pathway product candidates have broad application in oncology as well as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance. Recent advancements reported in numerous leading scientific journals have generated significant interest and rationale for targeting the STING receptor as a novel therapeutic approach to immuno-oncology. We are developing a portfolio of synthetic proprietary small molecule immune modulators that target and activate the STING receptor with application across diverse diseases. The STING receptor is generally expressed at high levels in immune cells, including dendritic cells, or DCs, and many other cells in the body. Once activated, the STING receptor initiates a profound innate immune response by signaling through at least three distinct pathways, inducing the expression of a broad profile of cytokines, including interferons and chemokines. In addition to this cytokine profile, the enhanced tumor antigen-presenting capacity subsequently leads to the development of an effective tumor antigen-specific T cell adaptive immune response. We are also pursuing product opportunities that downregulate the STING pathway.
 5

Naturally occurring cyclic dinucleotides, or CDNs, that target the STING receptor are produced by bacteria that secrete CDNs into the host cell or by mammalian cells through cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase, or cGAS. cGAS is a receptor that senses double-stranded (ds) DNA in the cytosol of antigen presenting cells, or APCs, and in response synthesizes a CDN that is structurally distinct from the CDNs produced by bacteria. While both bacterial- and cGAS-produced CDNs target and activate the STING receptor, CDNs produced by cGAS bind more tightly to STING than CDNs produced by bacteria. This stronger binding triggers a larger and more stable change in shape of the STING receptor, leading to the development of a more effective tumor antigen-specific immune response. Additionally, while some of the five known STING alleles in humans respond poorly to CDNs produced by bacteria, all respond to CDNs produced by cGAS. We are advancing through development novel synthetic STING pathway product candidates that are active in all five known human STING alleles. 
 We have developed proprietary STING pathway activator derivative compounds that are significantly more potent than the natural cGAS-produced molecules, which can be demonstrated by comparing the expression levels the cytokines produced from signaling through three distinct pathways. The NF-kB pathway induces the expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNFa that stimulate a variety of immune cells. The IRF-3 pathway leads to the induction of IFN-b and co-regulated genes, which orchestrates diverse innate immune responses. The STAT6 pathway leads to expression of chemokines, including CCL2 and CCL20 that are involved in immune cell recruitment. The unique profile of cytokines induced through activating the STING receptor results in strong efficacy in numerous aggressive preclinical mouse models of cancer. 
 

In healthy individuals, DCs and other APCs constantly sample nearby tumor and non-tumor cells. However, in cancer patients, tumors can produce immune-inhibitory molecules which can make the DCs non-functional. We believe the activation of the STING receptor in the tumor microenvironment by intratumoral injection of our proprietary STING pathway activator product candidates stimulate the maturation of the DCs, leading to the presentation of antigens found on the individual’s unique tumor. The activated tumor-specific T cells induce tumor cell death both locally and systemically, resulting in significant and durable therapeutic efficacy in preclinical tumor models. 
 STING Pathway Product Candidates 
 We envision multiple STING pathway product opportunities, particularly in combination with other treatments. In preclinical animal models, our data have shown that our proprietary STING pathway activator product candidates can be combined with designated recombinant proteins to induce potent antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, which recognize foreign antigens and assist in the immune response, and CD8+ T cells, which recognize and destroy cells expressing foreign antigens. We believe our STING pathway product candidates can also be combined with conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy to enhance immune-mediated tumor killing mechanisms. We also believe that our STING pathway product candidates could alter the nature of the tumor microenvironment, thus allowing for improved responses to checkpoint inhibitors. 
 6

In addition, our STING pathway product candidates directly activate natural killer cells and could enhance Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, or ADCC, tumor cell killing mechanisms, which are a significant mechanism of action of several established monoclonal antibody therapies. Another possible opportunity would be to directly conjugate our STING pathway activator product candidates to enhance ADCC. 
 ADU-S100 
 Our lead STING pathway product candidate is ADU-S100 (also known as MIW815), which differs from naturally occurring CDNs through the provision of proprietary modifications designed to optimize stability, STING receptor binding affinity and potency, without significant toxicity. In March 2015, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with Novartis to further advance the research and development of STING pathway product candidates in oncology. 
 ADU-S100 Preclinical Studies 
 In preclinical mouse tumor models, Intratumoral, or IT, injection of ADU-S100 induced tumor shrinkage and generated substantial immune responses capable of providing long-lasting systemic antigen-specific T cell immunity to prevent further growth of distal, untreated tumor metastases, a response known as an abscopal effect. Further preclinical studies demonstrated that the abscopal effect is entirely STING receptor-dependent. These data provide the rationale for advancing this novel molecule for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic cancers. 
 
Further rationale for the approach of IT injection of ADU-S100 is the recent discovery that the STING-dependent innate immune sensing in the tumor microenvironment is a critical step in promoting spontaneous tumor-initiated T cell priming, subsequent infiltration of tumor lymphocytes and tumor regression. Analyses conducted with tumors isolated from melanoma patients have also revealed that tumors containing infiltrating activated T cells are characterized by an IFN gene signature. Studies in mice have demonstrated that IFN-ß signaling plays a critical role in tumor-initiated T cell priming. We believe that treatment strategies to induce IFN-ß signaling and DC activation in the tumor microenvironment to bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses have significant therapeutic potential. IT delivery of our synthetic STING pathway activator product candidates activate a tumor-specific T cell response that is unique to the individual’s tumor; conceptually, a small molecule approach to patient-specific immuno-oncology treatments. 
 
We are advancing development of ADU-S100 in multiple clinical trials designed to further assess its potential. 
 Phase 1 ADU-S100 (Ongoing)
 A Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial with ADU-S100 is ongoing in collaboration with Novartis. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of ADU-S100 in patients with advanced, metastatic treatment-refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. In this multicenter, open-label trial, ADU-S100 is administered intratumorally on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-d
ay cycle.
 The Phase 1 monotherapy trial of ADU-S100 is being conducted in a heterogeneous and heavily pre-treated patient population. Preliminary results from the 50 – 3200 mcg dose cohorts of this ongoing monotherapy trial were presented at the SITC 33rd Annual Meeting in November 2018.
 
Preliminary signs of clinical activity were seen in several patients, including some who received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The results indicated ADU-S100 is safe and well-tolerated. Target engagement of ADU-S100 and activation of the STING pathway was demonstrated by increases in key systemic cytokines, including IL-6, MCP-1 and IFN-β, observed after administration. Over 20 types of cancer have been treated in this trial, including Merkel cell, parotid gland, colorectal, endometrial, ER+ and triple-negative breast cancer, esophageal, collecting duct carcinoma, ovarian, Hodgkin's disease, hemangioepithelioma and other cancers. Enrollment is ongoing for additional patient cohorts.
 We and Novartis are continuing to evaluate additional pathology and other biomarkers to assess the pharmacological activity of ADU-S100 in patients. 
 7

Phase 1 ADU-S100 in Combination with Spartalizumab (Ongoing)
 A Phase 1b dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ADU-S100 in combination with spartalizumab (PDR001), Novartis' investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. The multicenter, open-label trial is currently enrolling patients with advanced, metastatic treatment-refractory solid tumors or lymphomas and is evaluating two treatment schedules of ADU-S100 in dose escalation with a fixed dose of spartalizumab. Patients in Group A receive a fixed dose of intravenous spartalizumab on day 1 and an intratumoral injection of ADU-S100 three times (day 1, 8, 15) in a 28-day cycle. Patients in Group B receive a fixed dose of intravenous spartalizumab on day 1 and an intratumoral injection of ADU-S100 on day 1 of every 28-day cycle. The dose escalation combination trial is enrolling patients with multiple cancers and who have received multiple lines of prior therapies, including prior immunotherapy. 
 Preliminary observations from the 50 – 400 mcg dose cohorts of the ongoing study of ADU-S100 in combination with spartalizumab included: 
  
• | clinical responses observed in several tumor types, including a subset of patients who had previously demonstrated responses to checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced tumor volume in injected and non-injected lesions in some patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | several patients remained on study longer than 6 months; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety profile consistent with what has been observed in the ADU-S100 monotherapy study.

Melanoma Overview
 Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer that develops in cells called melanocytes that make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Melanomas can develop anywhere on the body and most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as the back, legs, arms and face. Often, the first signs and symptoms of melanoma include a change in the size, shape, color, or feel of a mole or the development of new pigmented or unusual growth on the skin. The incidence of melanoma increases with age. Melanoma represents 5.3 percent of all new cancer cases in the United States and is the fifth most common type of cancer in men and women of all age groups. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that there will be 96,480 new cases of melanoma in the United States and 7,230 deaths from the disease. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 132,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed worldwide each year. 
 Phase 1 ADU-S100 in Combination with ipilimumab in Melanoma (Ongoing)
 In 2018, the protocol for investigation of ADU-S100 as a single agent was amended to include a study arm evaluating ADU-S100 in combination with ipilimumab, an approved anti-CTLA-4 antibody for the treatment of relapsed and refractory melanoma. This is the first clinical trial evaluating ADU-S100 in a homogenous patient population. The ongoing multicenter trial is enrolling advanced melanoma patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab or pembrolizumab. During the ongoing dose escalation phase of the trial, ipilimumab will be administered at its approved dose and schedule, while the dose of ADU-S100 will be escalated. ADU-S100 is administered intratumorally on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle (starting dose 200 mcg) and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) is administered intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for the first 4 cycles. The dose expansion phase of the trial will evaluate the optimized dose of ADU-S100 in combination with ipilimumab in two expansion cohorts that will enroll patients with cutaneously and viscerally accessible melanoma. 
 
Head and Neck Cancer Overview
 Cancers that are known collectively as head and neck cancers often begin in the squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck, including the oral cavity, larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, thyroid and salivary glands. These squamous cell cancers are often referred to as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN. The symptoms of head and neck cancers may include a lump or a sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, difficulty in swallowing and a change or hoarseness in the voice. SCCHN accounts for over 90 percent of head and neck cancers and is the sixth most common cancer by incidence worldwide. Each year, SCCHN is diagnosed in more than 600,000 people globally, with 50,000 new cases and more than 10,000 deaths occurring in the United States alone. Rates of death due to SCCHN have declined only slightly in the United States over the past three decades, and the all-stage survival rates of 61 percent at five years and 50 percent at 10 years illustrate the need for improved therapy.
 
8

Phase 1b/2 ADU-S100 in Combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in SCCHN (Planned)
 We expect to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ADU-S100 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with SCCHN in the second half of 2019.
 cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor Program 
 In addition to our current STING pathway product candidates that activate the STING receptor, we are developing product candidates that are designed to prevent or control immune responses through the STING pathway. We believe these product candidates may have broad application in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In December 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly for our cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor program for the research and development of novel product candidates for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. 
 The presence of cytosolic DNA from pathogens or mislocalization of self-DNA is detected by cGAS. Upon binding DNA, cGAS produces a CDN that activates STING and induces expression of type I interferons and other interferon-stimulated genes. Pathological conditions leading to mislocalized cytosolic DNA or genetic mutations that activate components of the cGAS-STING pathway can lead to overproduction of type I interferons. Our cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor product candidates are small molecules that are being designed to bind and block the signaling that channels through the pathway to reduce excessive type 1 interferon production that drive certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These small molecules originate from several high throughput screens and are further optimized to impart adequate potency and systemic bioavailability.
 APRIL Pathway Technology
 We believe key attributes of our APRIL pathway technology include:
  
• | Early Evidence of Potency. BION-1301, a humanized antibody that blocks APRIL from binding to both the BCMA and TACI receptors, has been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit multiple myeloma tumor growth, drug resistance and immune suppression. BION-1301 has also been shown in preclinical studies to reduce serum IgA levels in mice and monkeys, demonstrating compelling rationale for its use in IgA nephropathy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel Mechanism. Blocking APRIL is a distinct approach to inhibit both the BCMA and TACI receptors that appears to have immunomodulatory properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatility. APRIL is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple indications including IgA nephropathy and multiple myeloma.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Manufacture. BION-1301 is a biologic that can be manufactured through well-established processes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Applicability. BION-1301 is a monoclonal antibody, an established therapeutic class to treat cancer as well as autoimmune diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 APRIL plays a crucial part in the protective bone marrow tumor microenvironment. APRIL is a ligand for the BCMA and TACI receptors and mediates important B-cell functions. APRIL serum levels are enhanced in patients diagnosed with IgA nephropathy and multiple myeloma (MM). APRIL-driven IgA production in IgA nephropathy has been demonstrated in preclinical studies. In an IgA nephropathy mouse model, blocking APRIL prevents an increase in proteinuria and decreases serum IgA. In preclinical studies, APRIL was also shown to be critically involved in the survival, proliferation and chemoresistance of multiple myeloma tumor cells through binding of its receptor BCMA, and APRIL upregulated mechanisms of immune resistance, involving PD-L1, IL-10, TGF-β and other factors in this model.

APRIL Product Candidates
 BION-1301
 BION-1301 is a first-in-class, fully blocking humanized monoclonal anti-APRIL antibody and is being developed as a novel therapy for IgA nephropathy and multiple myeloma. BION-1301 blocks APRIL from binding to both the BCMA and TACI receptors, and has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce serum IgA levels in mice and monkeys. BION-1301 has also been shown in preclinical models to halt tumor growth and overcome resistance to MM drugs such as lenalidomide and bortezomib. In addition, BION-1301 has been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit immune suppressive effects of regulatory T cells via TACI. 
IgA Nephropathy Overview
 IgA nephropathy is a kidney disease characterized by the accumulation of autoantibodies binding to galactose-deficient immunoglobulin A (IgA) leading to deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli of the kidneys. This results in inflammation that damages the glomeruli, causing proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Among patients who develop overt proteinuria and/or an elevated serum creatinine concentration, progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is approximately 15 to 25 percent at 10 years and 20 to 30 percent at 20 years. No cure currently exists for IgA nephropathy and treatments are targeted towards preventing progression to ESRD and alleviating symptoms. IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent primary chronic glomerular disease worldwide. While prevalence varies geographically, biopsy and dialysis registry data suggest a higher incidence of IgA nephropathy in East Asian populations and lower incidence in African populations. Variations in disease prevalence may reflect regional differences in screening for kidney disease and kidney biopsy practices. Many patients with IgA nephropathy are detected on routine urine screening because their only clinical manifestation is asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria. Prevalence may therefore appear to be higher in countries with an active urine testing program and a low threshold for the performance of renal biopsy in patients with isolated asymptomatic hematuria, such as Japan and Korea, where testing is routinely performed in schools and in the workplace. Conversely, clinicians in North America seldom biopsy a patient with isolated hematuria or mild proteinuria, resulting in an apparently lower disease prevalence.
 

Phase 1 BION 1301 in IgA Nephropathy (Planned)
 In the first half of 2019, we expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of BION-1301 in IgA nephropathy in healthy volunteers followed by IgA nephropathy patients at a later date. The primary objectives of this clinical trial are to: 
  
• | Assess the safety profile of BION-1301 in healthy volunteers and IgA nephropathy patients,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Determine the PK/PD relationship in healthy volunteers and IgA nephropathy patients, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish proof-of-mechanism.
--+------------------------------

Multiple Myeloma Overview
 Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. Often no symptoms are initially noticed, but when the disease is advanced, fractures, bone pain, frequent infections, kidney dysfunction and anemia may occur. Complications may include amyloidosis. Globally, the 2016 prevalence of multiple myeloma was estimated at 130,000 and the annual mortality was approximately 98,437. In the United States, the 2018 incidence was estimated at 30,770 new cases and the annual mortality was approximately 12,770. Despite new treatments recently approved in multiple myeloma, this disease remains incurable as patients relapse or become resistant to currently-available therapies.
Phase 1/2 BION-1301 in Multiple Myeloma (Ongoing )
 In December 2017, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BION-1301 in multiple myeloma. The Phase 1/2 is a two-part, multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and activity of BION-1301 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after at least three prior systemic therapies, including immunomodulatory drugs, or iMiDs, proteasome inhibitors, chemotherapies or monoclonal antibodies. The Phase 1 part of the study is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of escalating doses of BION-1301. 
Other Programs
 Anti-CD27 Antibody
 CD27 is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on different immune cells, such as T-lymphocytes and NK cells. It has been recognized as having a critical role in priming, enhancing and sustaining a productive anti-cancer (CD8 T-cell) adaptive immune response. In preclinical studies, anti-CD27 activation in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition has demonstrated enhanced tumor rejection. Our anti-CD27 antibody is exclusively licensed to Merck and is being advanced under our license agreement in Phase 1 clinical development. We believe our anti-CD27 antibody is distinct because it targets a functional epitope on CD27 that has demonstrated potent activation of the CD27 co-stimulatory pathway in preclinical studies.
Manufacturing
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We have established manufacturing processes and supply and quality agreements for all of the investigational agents used in our ongoing clinical trials. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We may continue to rely on CMOs to manufacture our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights.
 11

STING Pathway Activator Product Candidates 
 Manufacturing of our STING Activator product candidates generally encompasses both the chemical synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and its formulation and fill/finish of the final product. The synthetic process for the manufacture of our STING Activator product candidates is a trade secret and we retain control and ownership of the process. We have contracts with a CMO to produce, release and stability test the ADU-S100 API and drug product. Under our collaboration agreement with Novartis, Novartis has manufacturing rights for the manufacture of ADU-S100.
APRIL Pathway Candidates 
 Manufacturing of B-select product candidates includes generation of engineered cell lines that express and secrete the antibody product candidates. After selection of clones that secrete the desired amounts of product candidates, cell banks are generated and stored to preserve identity and characteristics. Process development, upstream and downstream, is undertaken to select optimal conditions for growth and productivity, quality standards and yield. In addition, activities are undertaken to identify formulation composition to establish stability characteristics. We contract with a CMO to develop, produce and release drug substance and drug product for our antibody candidates targeting APRIL and CTLA-4. 
Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on protections afforded through data exclusively, patent term extensions and regulatory exclusivity, where available. 
 Through licensing and through developing our own portfolio, we have rights to more than 150 issued patents and more than 300 pending applications in the United States and foreign countries. Patent families within the portfolio are directed to our STING and APRIL technologies as well as our other non-core programs.

, if these claims were to be issued, they could extend protection for such products until 2039.
 General Considerations 
 As with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our product candidates will depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent claims that cover such product candidates and their intended methods of use, and enforcing those claims once granted. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 
 Certain of our product candidates may be subject to The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA.  The BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The BPCIA is complex and is still in the process of being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact and implementation are subject to uncertainty.
 Many biopharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe upon the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion, we may be subject to patent litigation. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court or tribunal declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome can be favorable or unfavorable. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements with some of our consultants that require them to assign to us any inventions created as a result of their working with us. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Our commercial success will depend in part upon not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us or our licensee(s) to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. If a third party commences a patent infringement action against us, or our licensee(s), it could consume significant financial and management resources, regardless of the merit of the claims or the outcome of the litigation. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. It is possible that these agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Collaborations 
 Novartis Agreement
 In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, pursuant to which we are collaborating worldwide with Novartis regarding the development and commercialization of product candidates containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under this agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis a co-exclusive license to develop such products worldwide, an exclusive license to commercialize such products outside the United States and a non-exclusive license to support us in commercializing such products in the United States if we request such support. The collaboration is guided by a joint steering committee with each party having final decision making authority regarding specified areas of development or commercialization.
 Under the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million from Novartis in April 2015. In 2016, we earned a $35.0 million development milestone upon initiation of a Phase 1 trial for the first STING product candidate, ADU-S100. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $215.0 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250.0 million in regulatory approval milestones. 
 We are responsible for 38% of the joint development costs worldwide and Novartis is responsible for the remaining 62% of the joint development costs worldwide.
We will also receive 50% of gross profits on sales of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States and 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. For each of these profit share countries, each party will be responsible for its respective commercial sharing percentage of all joint commercialization costs incurred in that country.
 For all other countries where we are not sharing profits, Novartis will be responsible for all commercialization costs and will pay us a royalty in the mid-teens on all net sales of product sold by Novartis, its affiliates and sublicensees, with such percentage subject to reduction post patent and data exclusivity expiration and subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for royalties payable to third party licensors. Novartis’ royalty obligation will run on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim covering the product, expiration of data exclusivity for the product or 12 years after first commercial sale of the product in such country.
 With respect to the United States, specified European countries and/or Japan, we may elect for such region to either reduce by 50% or to eliminate in our development and commercialization cost sharing obligation. If we elect to reduce our cost sharing percentage by 50% in any such region, then our profit share in such region will also be reduced by 50%. If we elect to eliminate our development cost sharing obligation, then such region will be removed from the profit share, and instead Novartis will owe us royalties on any net sales of product for such region, as described above.
 
Lilly Agreement
 On December 18, 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly for our cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor program for the research and development of novel immunotherapies for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. Pursuant to this agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, we granted an exclusive and worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by us to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize certain cGAS-STING products for the treatment of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. The license granted is sublicensable during a specified time period. 
 Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2019 and will be eligible for development and commercial milestones of up to approximately $620.0 million per product. Lilly is also obligated to pay us tiered royalty payments at percentages in the single to low-double digits based on annual net sales of the licensed products. Lilly must pay such royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of certain patents, (ii) the expiration of the data exclusivity period in such country or (iii) a specified anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. We will be reimbursed for up to a certain amount of research funding spent during the research term. In addition, we have the option to co-fund the clinical development of each product in exchange for an increase in royalty payments and a reduction in certain milestone payments to the extent relevant to such co-funded product. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization.
 The Lilly Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations and may be terminated by Lilly following specified notice period, or by either party in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party or bankruptcy of the other party.

Merck Agreement
 In connection with the acquisition of Aduro Biotech Europe Holdings, Europe B.V., or Aduro Biotech Europe, in October 2015, we became party to an Exclusive Patent and Know How License and Research Collaboration Agreement with Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck, pursuant to which we have exclusively licensed our anti-CD27 antibody to Merck. This agreement, or the Merck Agreement, sets forth the parties’ respective obligations for development, and commercialization of certain antibody product candidates.
 Since the execution of the Merck Agreement, we have received $5.0 million in connection with achievement of development milestones for our anti-CD27 antibody. Under the Merck Agreement we are eligible to receive future contingent payments, including up to $307.0 million in potential development milestone payments, and up to $135.0 million in commercial and net sales milestones for a product candidate. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties in the mid-single digits to low teens based on net sales of the product.
 
Janssen ADU-214, ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate Agreements
 On September 25, 2018, we received written notices of termination from Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, for its Research and License Agreements pertaining to our proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria for treatment of lung and prostate cancers. Specifically, Janssen delivered notice for the following agreements, or the Janssen Agreements: (i) the Research and License Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2014, as amended by the Amendment to Research and License Agreements, dated as of November 11, 2015, or the Amendment; (ii) the Research and License Agreement, dated as of May 27, 2014, as amended by the Amendment; and (iii) the GVAX Prostate License Agreement, dated as of May 27, 2014. The terminations were effective December 24, 2018.
 Under the terms of the Janssen Agreements, we granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture, use, sell and otherwise exploit products containing ADU-214, ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate for any and all uses. We also granted Janssen exclusive rights to develop products utilizing our proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria for treatment of lung and prostate cancers. We previously received upfront license fees of $42.5 million and milestone payments of $31.0 million upon completion of various development activities and were eligible to receive future contingent payments based on development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as royalties on any net sales of licensed products by Janssen under each of the Janssen Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Janssen Agreements, upon Janssen’s termination, we regained worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products containing ADU-214, ADU-741 and GVAX Prostate for any and all uses. 
 Our Research and Development and License Agreements
 STING Pathway License Agreements 
 Karagen Agreement 
 In June 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Karagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Karagen, pursuant to which Karagen granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license under certain patents and know-how related to STING pathway technologies to make, develop, use and commercialize products for use in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of cancer or precancerous conditions and a non-exclusive license to such patents and know-how to make, develop, use and commercialize products for all other uses. Under the agreement, or the Karagen Agreement, we were also granted an option to designate a particular disease or condition to be added to the field of use under our exclusive license. Under the Karagen Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in the United States and the European Union. 
 Under the Karagen Agreement, we are required to make milestone payments totaling up to $900,000, in aggregate, for the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones as well as royalties based on net sales of products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees at rates ranging in the low single-digit percentages, determined by whether the disease field is an exclusive or non-exclusive disease field, subject to minimum annual royalties and standard reductions. In addition, we are required to pay Karagen a percentage of consideration received from any sublicensing arrangements ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teen digits determined by the current stage of development of the relevant licensed product at the time of the sublicense grant, or by whether we have exercised our option to add a designated field of use to its exclusive license, as applicable. 
 The Karagen Agreement will expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights. Either party may terminate the Karagen Agreement upon 90 days’ advance written notice in the event of the other party’s material breach that is not cured within such 90-day period, and immediately upon notice in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Additionally, we may terminate the Karagen Agreement at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice to Karagen. 
 15

UCB Vance Agreement 
 In September 2014, we entered into a license agreement with UC Berkeley, granting us an exclusive, worldwide sublicenseable license under certain patent rights covering the use of the STING Activator molecules that activate the STING receptor to make, develop, use and commercialize products, to practice methods and to offer services, in each case that are covered by the licensed patent rights, in all fields of use. Under this agreement, or the UCB Vance Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and sell licensed products and services and are obligated to achieve specified development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. 
 Under the UCB Vance Agreement, we paid UCB an upfront fee of $50,000 in 2014 and are required to make future milestone payments totaling up to $1.5 million, in the aggregate, upon our achievement of certain specified development and regulatory milestones for the first indication and up to $250,000 upon our achievement of a specified development and regulatory milestone for each additional indication developed. Under the UCB Vance Agreement, we are obligated to pay UCB royalties based on net sales of licensed products and services sold by us and our sublicensees at a rate in the low single-digit percentages, subject to minimum annual royalties and customary reductions, and a percentage of consideration received from any sublicensing arrangements at rates ranging from the low-single digits to the low thirties, determined by the current stage of development of the relevant licensed product at the time the sublicense is granted. 
 The UCB Vance Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights. UCB may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ advance written notice in the event of our material breach that is not cured within such 90-day period. We may terminate the agreement at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice. UCB may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ advance written notice in the event we challenge the validity or unenforceability of any licensed patent. 
 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Agreement 
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK, The Rockefeller University, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and University of Bonn, collectively the Licensors, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents related to STING Activators and a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under specified know-how, in each case to develop, make, have made, use, have used, import, sell, and otherwise commercialize licensed products for use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in humans. Under the agreement, or the MSK Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product, including achieving specified development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. In May and October 2016, the parties amended the license to further expand its scope, which now covers all products covered by the licensed intellectual property.
 Under the MSK Agreement, we paid MSK upfront fees of $50,000 in 2015 and an additional $2.0 million in 2016 in connection with the second amendment of the MSK Agreement. Under the amended MSK Agreement we are required to pay MSK development and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $875,000 for each licensed product and commercialization milestone payments totaling up to $4.5 million for each licensed product. We are also required to pay MSK royalties based on net sales of licensed products by us and our sublicensees at a rate ranging in the low single digits depending on whether the licensed product is covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to minimum annual royalties. Our royalty obligation to MSK continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last patent right covering the licensed product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale in such country. We are also obligated to pay MSK a percentage of certain consideration received for the grant of sublicenses, ranging from ten to the mid-twenties. 
 The MSK Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations. Either party may terminate the MSK Agreement upon the other party’s uncured material breach that is not cured within 90 days after the breaching party receives notice of such breach. Additionally, the Licensors may terminate the MSK Agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we fail to pay any undisputed amounts owed under the agreement and do not cure such failure within 30 days after receiving notice of such failure. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. A wide variety of institutions, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies developing immunotherapy products.  
 16

Our competitors in the field of diversified immunotherapy include: AstraZeneca PLC, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Incyte Corporation, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Merck & Co., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG and Sanofi SA. Our competitors in STING pathway technology include Merck & Co., Inc., Synlogic, Inc. and Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals; for anti-APRIL includes Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. (Visterra, Inc.); and for the cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor program includes IFM Due, a subsidiary of IFM Therapeutics, LLC. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States and the Netherlands, we are subject to extensive regulation. Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The FDA has limited experience with commercial development of combination immuno-oncology products. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for any biologic or an NDA for any drug we seek to market that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency, or safety and effectiveness from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA or BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control (except in the cases of Sponsor-Investigator studies). Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gather additional information about a product's safety, efficacy or optimal use. Some of the studies may be required under statue or regulation; others may be trials a sponsor has committed to conduct. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Quarterly safety reporting is required for marketed products for the first three years after approval. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials (for INDs) and changes to the application (for marketed products) must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events that are considered related to study drug, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening adverse reaction that is considered related to study drug within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immuno-oncology trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA or NDA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA or NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for marketed products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA may be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA or NDA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that offer significant improvements in safety or efficacy, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for original BLAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.
 19

The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and in the case of an NDA, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological or drug products or biological or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA or NDA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA or NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. 
 Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 20

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any indications or for any product candidates. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA or NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA or NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA or NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA or NDA. 
 Any product, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation is available for product candidates that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both Fast Track designation and priority review, which can also be granted to the same product if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, FDA will work closely with the sponsor to expedite the development and review of such product. 
 21

Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. 
 Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its product as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests that the innovator company conduct certain pediatric clinical investigations of the product.
 22

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA or NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may choose to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent terms, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
 23

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” made to such physician owners. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide 
 24

coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act. 
 Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are the following: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25

 
• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. Congress also could consider additional legislation to repeal or replace other elements of the Affordable Care Act. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act (or other similar legislation) on our business remains unclear.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business, though we are still unsure what its full impact will be. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenue potential and results. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
Additional Regulation 
 In addition, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. State and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, also affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 26

Europe and Rest of World Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
