Who We Are
Academy Sports + Outdoors is one of the leading full-line sporting goods and outdoor recreation retailers in the United States. Originally founded in 1938 as a family business in Texas, we now operate 259 stores across 16 contiguous states. Our mission is to provide “Fun for All” and we fulfill this mission with a localized merchandising strategy and value proposition that deeply connect with a broad range of consumers. Our product assortment focuses on key categories of outdoor, apparel, sports & recreation and footwear (representing 32%, 27%, 22% and 19% of our 2021 net sales, respectively) through both leading national brands and a portfolio of 20 owned brands, which go well beyond traditional sporting goods and apparel offerings.
We believe the following attributes differentiate us from our competitors:
•Value-based assortment that enables our customers to participate and have fun, no matter their budget.
•Broad assortment that extends beyond sporting goods and apparel to outdoor recreation and is localized for individual stores.
•Emerging, growing and profitable omnichannel strategy that leverages our buy-online-pickup-in-store program ("BOPIS") and shipping fulfillment capabilities.
•Strong customer loyalty, with opportunities to increase penetration in existing markets.
•Regional focus in the southern United States with a growing presence in some of the fastest-growing Metropolitan Statistical Areas (or "MSAs").
•Core customers comprising active families that we support with one-stop shop convenience.
•Significant whitespace opportunity for new stores for both in-fill and adjacent geographies and new markets.
We believe we sit in a sweet-spot of consumer demand, offering a broad, value-based assortment of sporting goods and outdoor recreation products, so our customers can participate and have fun, no matter their budget. Sporting goods shoppers consistently rate us as the top retailer for offering sporting and outdoor recreation products for a wide range of customers and being a one-stop shop. We carefully curate our products to provide the right assortment that appeal to beginners, experts, families and casual participants. 
Our access to national brand and owned brand merchandise creates a comprehensive portfolio of value-based and diversified products, spanning various price-points, that differentiates our assortment from our peers. Our category, brand and price-point mix is unique to Academy and difficult to replicate at other retailers. Approximately 80% of our 2021 merchandise sales was comprised of national brand products, with the remainder coming from exclusive products in our portfolio of 20 owned brands. We have minimal product overlap with direct-to-consumer brands and competitors. No single brand we carry accounted for more than 11% of our 2021 sales.
We endeavor to offer products for customers of all ages, incomes and aspirations across sporting and outdoor recreation activities, seasons and experience levels. As such, we have a balanced, year-round business and a large customer base. Our average customer visits our stores anywhere from two to three times per year. 
Strategic Priorities
We made tremendous progress against our 2021 key business priorities. For omnichannel, we implemented improved search capabilities, increased check-out speed, added more payment options and launched a new mobile app. To enhance our customer shopping experience, we focused on better service, better looking stores, and better products. We continued to enhance our merchandise planning and allocation capabilities to increase our inventory efficiency and optimize our markdown strategy to increase sales and expand gross margin. In addition, we have taken measures to protect and strengthen our supply chain.
In 2022, we are continuing our efforts to be the best sports and outdoors retailer in the country. We expect to do this by executing on these key priorities:
•Creating a consistent and meaningful omnichannel business that delivers a true omnichannel experience for the customer;
•Providing a great customer experience across all of our points of contact that drives loyalty and long-term growth;
•Growing our store base to strengthen existing markets and enter new ones successfully;
•And we expect to foster our continued growth by:
◦Strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of our supply chain;
◦Developing and retaining an industry leading retail team; and
◦Maintaining and scaling our IT capabilities.
Our Industry
The retail business is highly competitive based on many variables including price, product assortment, customer service, omnichannel experience and store locations.
The retail sporting goods and outdoor recreation retail industry comprises six principal categories of retailers:
•Mass general merchants (examples: Walmart, Kohl’s and Target) generally range in size from 50,000 to over 200,000 square feet and are typically located in shopping centers, free-standing sites or regional malls. Sporting goods merchandise and apparel and outdoor recreation products may represent a small portion of the total merchandise in these stores. 
•Large format sporting goods stores (examples: Dick’s Sporting Goods and Scheels) generally range in size from 20,000 to over 100,000 square feet and offer a broad selection of sporting goods and outdoor recreation merchandise.
•Traditional sporting goods stores (examples: Hibbett Sports and Big 5 Sporting Goods) generally range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and are frequently located in regional malls and shopping centers and typically carry a varied assortment of primarily sporting goods merchandise.
•Specialty outdoor retailers (examples: Bass Pro Shop/Cabela’s and Sportsman’s Warehouse) generally range in size from 7,500 to over 100,000 square feet and typically focus on specific categories such as outdoor recreation.
•Specialty footwear retailers (examples: Foot Locker, Boot Barn and The Finish Line) generally range in size from 2,000 to 20,000 square feet and typically focus on specific categories such as athletic footwear. 
•Catalogue & Internet retailers (examples: Amazon and eBay) do not typically operate brick and mortar stores and primarily rely on delivery of goods. Sporting goods merchandise and apparel and outdoor recreation products may represent a small portion of the total merchandise on their websites.
Our primary competitors are large format sporting goods stores and mass general merchants that offer sporting goods, outdoor recreation products and other lifestyle and recreational merchandise.
Merchandising
Our merchandise consists of national brand products that we purchase and license from various vendors, owned brand products that we brand with our internal brands and exclusive license products that we purchase and license from vendors and carry exclusively. We have long-standing relationships with many of our suppliers and have partnered with them to grow our business over time. In 2021, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,200 vendors. For 2021, 2020 and 2019 no vendor represented more than 11%, 12%, and 14% of our total purchases, respectively.
We have premium access to hundreds of well-recognized national brands, such as Nike, Under Armour, adidas, Winchester, Brooks, Crocs, Wilson, Spaulding, Yeti, the North Face, and Columbia Sportswear, which are critical to our market penetration. These and some of our other national brands rely on us to broaden their consumer reach, which fosters a mutually beneficial relationship when it comes to pricing and assortment. We play a critical role in delivering customer volume for these brands, especially as mall-based retailers face further headwinds and our industry consolidates. Our national brand assortment spans across each brand’s price spectrum beyond those of our competitors and we expand below the national brand price spectrum by complementing the assortment with our owned brands. As such, we receive favorable product exclusivity from leading suppliers.
Our owned brand portfolio consists of 20 brands, including Magellan Outdoors, BCG, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Outdoor Gourmet and Freely. Our owned brand strategy focuses on in-filling categories and price points that our national brand products may not satisfy. Our owned brand offerings support and complement our overall merchandising strategy due to limited price-point overlap with national brands. Additionally, our owned brands generate strong brand equity and drive significant customer loyalty. Approximately 57% of our customers purchased an owned brand from us in 2021.
As of January 29, 2022, we generally organized our merchandise in four divisions made up of sixteen categories as follows:

Division | Category (1) | Primary product types (1) 
Outdoors | Camping | Coolers and drinkware, camping accessories, camping equipment, sunglasses, backpacks and sports bags 
 | Fishing | Marine equipment and fishing rods, reels, baits and equipment 
 | Shooting sports | Firearms, ammunition, archery and archery equipment, camouflage apparel, waders, shooting accessories, optics, airguns and hunting equipment 
Sports and Recreation | Fitness | Fitness equipment, fitness accessories and nutrition supplies 
 | Team sports | Team and specialty sports equipment, including baseball, football, basketball, soccer, golf, racket sports, and volleyball 
 | Recreation | Patio furniture, outdoor cooking, wheeled goods (bicycles, skateboards and other ride-on toys), trampolines, play sets, watersports and pet equipment
 | Front end | Electronics, watches, and front-end (consumables, batteries, etc.) 
Apparel | Outdoor and seasonal apparel | Outdoor apparel, seasonal apparel, denim, work apparel, graphic t-shirts and accessories 
 | Youth apparel | Boys and girls outdoor and athletic apparel 
 | Athletic apparel | Sporting apparel and apparel for fitness 
 | Licensed apparel | Professional and collegiate team licensed apparel and accessories 
Footwear | Casual and seasonal footwear | Casual shoes, slippers, seasonal footwear and socks 
 | Work footwear | Work and western boots, shoes and hunting footwear 
 | Youth footwear | Boys and girls athletic footwear 
 | Athletic footwear | Running shoes, athletic lifestyle and training shoes 
 | Team sports footwear | Team and specialty sports footwear and slides 

(1) Certain products and categories were reclassified amongst categories and divisions, respectively, during 2021 as compared to prior years in order to better align with our current merchandising strategy and view of the business. Changes in management's merchandise strategy and viewpoints could result in future reclassifications.
The following table sets forth the approximate amount of sales (all of which are based in the U.S.) by merchandise divisions for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):

 | Fiscal Year Ended
 | January 29, 2022 | | January 30, 2021 | | February 1, 2020
Merchandise sales (1) | | | | | 
Outdoors | $ | 2,174,650 | | | $ | 1,968,514 | | $ | 1,455,080
Sports and recreation | 1,463,172 | | | 1,256,357 | | | 974,125 
Apparel | 1,810,345 | | | 1,390,519 | | | 1,358,906
Footwear | 1,290,197 | | | 1,044,502 | | | 1,021,603
Total merchandise sales (2) | 6,738,364 | | | 5,659,892 | | | 4,809,714
Other sales (3) | 34,764 | | | 29,341 | | | 20,183 
Net sales | $ | 6,773,128 | | | $ | 5,689,233 | | $ | 4,829,897

(1) Certain products and categories were re-categorized amongst various categories and divisions, respectively, during 2021 as compared to prior years in order to better align with our current merchandising strategy and view of the business. As a result, we have reclassified sales between divisions for 2020 and 2019 for comparability purposes. This reclassification is in divisional presentation only and did not impact the overall net sales balances previously disclosed (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
(2) E-commerce sales consist of 9.3%, 10.4% and 5.1% of merchandise sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(3) Other sales consists primarily of the sales return allowance, gift card breakage income, credit card bounties and royalties, shipping income, net hunting and fishing license income and other items.
Stores
Our stores, all of which are based in the U.S., are designed to provide our customers with an easy-in, easy-out shopping experience. The interior of most of our stores are built around a central “racetrack” aisle that allows customers to efficiently navigate our selling floor. Additionally, our stores generally have consistent store layouts providing our customers familiarity across our entire store base. We seek to offer our customers strong merchandise assortment and a localized customer experience, which is facilitated by various types of merchandise fixtures and our large selling floor. Our central “racetrack” aisle and adjacent end-cap merchandising space allows us to adjust our inventory presentations throughout our various selling seasons.
Our stores average approximately 70,000 gross square feet, of which approximately 85% is dedicated to selling space. Our store locations are typically positioned adjacent to major highways or thoroughfares, allowing customers to easily locate our stores. We seek to position our stores in areas with certain population densities, demographics and other characteristics to maximize sales. These markets consist of metropolitan, suburban and smaller cities. Additionally, our stores are typically placed in retail centers adjacent to co-tenants who drive significant traffic, with no store tethered to crowded mall spaces. We seek to lease all of our stores in long-term lease agreements with third-party landlords, which typically range from 15 to 20 years. Other than stores that we may temporarily own, and for which we are in the process of executing sale-leaseback transactions, we do not own our retail locations.
We are active members of the communities in which we operate. We have a strong and growing presence in some of the fastest-growing MSAs in the United States, including Austin, Raleigh, Orlando, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Charlotte. Our long-time customers have grown up with the Academy brand over time and pass their passion for us on to the next generation, enabling us to benefit from strong customer loyalty and shopping frequency in our embedded regional markets.
As of January 29, 2022, the number of stores that we operated, exclusively in the U.S., by state was as follows:

State | Number of Stores
Texas | 106 
Louisiana | 18 
Georgia | 18 
Alabama | 15 
North Carolina | 15 
Tennessee | 13 
Oklahoma | 13 
Florida | 12 
Missouri | 10 
South Carolina | 9 
Arkansas | 8 
Mississippi | 8 
Kansas | 6 
Kentucky | 5 
Indiana | 2 
Illinois | 1 
 | 259 

We have significant growth opportunities in both our core markets and outside our footprint. We believe our real estate strategy has positioned us well for further expansion, and our track record has demonstrated that we can open and operate stores profitably. We believe there is significant near-term opportunity for expansion with stores in in-fill markets, where we already have an established presence, and in adjacent markets, markets nearby to current locations which are not fully represented. We expect to open at least eight stores in 2022.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce our broad selection of merchandise and value prices. We rely on various media to communicate with our customers including printed advertisements, television and radio commercials and digital marketing campaigns, among others. Our print advertisements are primarily comprised of newspaper and direct mail circulars. These print advertisements consist of a broad assortment of merchandise tailored to the season of the distribution. Our television and radio advertisements are typically themed to represent the current selling season and often feature certain merchandise related to that selling season. Our digital engagement includes communicating with our customers through paid search results, various social media platforms and email.
We often create events at our stores to drive customer traffic. These events include large grand opening celebrations to commemorate new store openings that offer various activities, food and games and often feature local celebrities. We also create championship events when professional or collegiate sports teams in our markets win league titles. At these events we extend our store hours and offer certain commemorative merchandise. We are active members in the communities we serve and sponsor over 3,000 local sports teams and enter into sponsorship agreements with local professional sports teams, associations, events, networks, players and collegiate programs.
We utilize data obtained from our customer relationship management, or CRM, tools, which enable us to create effective customer-targeting strategies. Our current CRM programs focus on welcoming our first-time customers, thanking our big spenders, reactivating our lapsed customers and cross-selling our category customers (including our hunting, sports equipment and recreation categories). We also utilize customer demographic data that we capture to know when our customers buy from us and what items they purchase. With over 40 million customers in our database, there is ample opportunity to increase our communication directly with our customers via one-on-one marketing.
In addition to our CRM tools, our Academy Credit Card program also provides data to track our customers’ purchases across all channels, giving us the ability to better serve and target those customers.
Distribution Centers
We operate three distribution centers in Katy, Texas; Twiggs County, Georgia; and Cookeville, Tennessee. The distribution centers receive and store products from vendors and use sophisticated sorting and logistical equipment to fill the product needs of the retail store locations they serve, as well as to fulfill e-commerce orders. Our distribution centers are leased under long-term agreements. Third-party trucking companies are used to disburse inventory from the distribution centers to and from our stores. These distribution centers are strategically located throughout our footprint to efficiently serve our retail locations, and have an ability to service up to an average of 110 locations each.
Information Technology
Our information technology systems are critical to our day-to-day operations as well as to our long-term growth strategies. Our technology is integrated across multiple functions throughout the organization, providing the data analysis, automation and solutions necessary to support our communications, inventory and supply chain management, store operations, distribution, point-of-sale, e-commerce, financial reporting and accounting functions. Our technology is the foundation of our merchandising and marketing functions; it processes our customers’ orders and integrates our e-commerce sales with stores. We are leveraging our data to make more informed decisions around inventory, marketing, and store-level operations. We have agreements with third parties to provide hosting services and administrative support for portions of our infrastructure, and utilize cloud-based systems in addition to those hosted on premises.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A significant portion of our net sales and profits is driven by summer holidays, such as Memorial Day, Father’s Day and Independence Day, during the second quarter. Our net sales and profits are also impacted by the November/December holiday selling season, and in part by the sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel during the fourth quarter.
Our Team Members
Our mission is to provide “Fun for All” and a critical component to our success is our people. As of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 22,000 team members in the U.S. and 11 team members in Hong Kong. Of those team members, approximately 50% were full-time and 50% were part-time. Our employment levels fluctuate over the course of the year mainly due to the seasonality of our business. None of our team members are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that it has a good working relationship with its team members.
Culture and Core Values.  We strive to provide rewarding careers, benefits, and a workplace culture where team members are empowered to be their authentic self—drawing on their unique perspectives, passions, skills, interests, and experiences in their day-to-day jobs. Our core values establish a strong foundation for our culture and represent the key expectations we have of our team members. These include the following:
•Customer focus and service
•Excellence in all we do
•Responsible leadership
•Initiative with urgency
•Students of the business
•Integrity always
•Positive impact on our communities
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. At Academy, we believe the diversity of our team members, customers, and all others with whom we interact enhances the quality of our work environment and our customers’ shopping experience. Academy encourages team members to work together and to value the strengths each team member brings to the team. Our strategy begins with attracting, recruiting, developing, and retaining team members with backgrounds that are representative of our diverse communities because it makes our company and communities stronger. We require all team members to complete unintentional bias training to help eliminate biases from recruiting, hiring, promotions, job assignments and opportunities, evaluations, compensation, and customer service.
In 2020, we established our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Committee, and they led the organization in the creation of the following formal Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Statement to further demonstrate our commitment:
At Academy Sports + Outdoors, we promote a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging, which should be reflected in the actions and behavior of our team members. Diversity is inviting all players to join the team. Inclusion and belonging are when everyone gets to play the game. Every player is key, and we are only successful when everyone has an equal opportunity to play and win.
Talent Management.  The best way to serve our customers is to invest in top talent, be open to innovation, and have the vision to succeed. We are focused on creating a winning team by recruiting and retaining great people, promoting teamwork, and fostering an enjoyable and rewarding work environment. We also strive to provide all team members with opportunities for personal growth, cross functional training, job opportunities and career advancement. We offer a mix of instructor-led, online, and blended courses in several key areas, including Career Development and Leadership Development. Our wide variety of courses ranges from job specific (i.e., functional) to broad based leadership training to safety, security, ethics, and compliance training. We also engage in regular and ongoing feedback, annual performance reviews and annual talent calibration conversations. Succession planning is conducted on an annual basis to identify suitable internal candidates for key positions within the Company.
Compensation and Benefits. We offer a competitive compensation and benefits package. Our benefits package is designed to allow team members the ability to pick and choose which benefits are the best for their and their family’s health and well-being. Depending on the team member’s employment and work status, they may be eligible for: medical, dental, and vision insurance; participation in the Company’s 401(k) Plan with a six percent dollar for dollar match up to the IRS deferral limit; participation in the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan which provides a 15 percent discount on the lower of the stock price at the beginning or the end of the each offering period; paid time off and paid vacations; tuition reimbursement programs; professional license/certification reimbursement; medical, family, and bereavement leave; additional voluntary short/long term, life, legal, pet, and accident insurance; paid maternity and parental leave; and a 20 percent team member discount on most all of our merchandise, to name a few. We also provide, in all our distribution centers and our Katy corporate office, subsidized meals for all team members. Specific to our Katy corporate office, we engage our team members through the opportunity to participate in intramural sport teams, 5K fun walk/run events, subsidized membership in the company gym and exercise classes (this is also open to our Katy distribution team members); “food truck Fridays”; onsite car wash; and a company holiday party and other team member appreciation events. In 2021, we paid over nine million dollars in thank you and retention bonuses to our hourly team members to reward them for their effort and support during a unique and challenging year. 
Workplace, Health and Safety.  The health and safety of our customers, team members, and communities is our top priority. We strive to ensure that a safe and hygienic working environment is provided and that occupational health and safety practices which prevent accidents and injury are promoted. Throughout our stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters, we employ policies, procedures, and training to promote safe and healthy work environments. 
Our team member handbook outlines safety expectations, but we also empower our team members with knowledge and skills from various safety training courses during the onboarding process and on an ongoing basis through our learning engagement system with topics such as incident reporting, behavior-based safety, evacuation, active shooter response, hazardous materials, ergonomics, heat safety, electrical safety, industrial truck and pallet jack safety, confined space entry and parking lot and garage safety. We continue to focus on developing and driving our safety-first culture through awareness, training, and actions to reduce the frequency and severity of safety incidents. 
During 2021, we continued our COVID-19 safety precautions based on Centers for Disease Control guidelines, including requiring all team members in stores, distribution centers, and the corporate office to socially distance; wear face coverings if they were not fully vaccinated or at-risk except when alone, eating or drinking; maintain proper hygiene; stay home if they did not feel well or test positive for COVID-19; and promptly notify their leader if they received a positive COVID-19 test result or developed symptoms of COVID-19. We also encouraged all team members to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination and booster and facilitated several free onsite vaccination events to offer team members a convenient way to get vaccinated. We have taken many additional actions in our stores based on the needs, risks, and regulations present in each community and facility, including cleaning stores professionally on a regular basis, equipping stores with hand sanitizer stations and signage illustrating how to socially distance within the store, limiting the number of customers admitted at one time, monitoring and sanitizing fitting rooms and sampled clothing, installing protective shields at cash registers and other countertops, and providing a cash incentive to our hourly population to get vaccinated. We have also provided free masks and hand sanitizer and may take team members’ temperatures when they report to work. We have taken similar actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our distribution centers and corporate office. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt our operations to address federal, state, and local requirements as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interest of our customers, team members, and communities.

Intellectual Property
Our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, processes, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property, including our Academy Sports + Outdoors brand, our owned brands, such as Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O’rageous, Game Winner, Outdoor Gourmet and Freely, and our designs, names, slogans, images and trade dress associated with these brands, are valuable assets that are critical to our success.
We also enter into intellectual property agreements whereby the Company receives the right to use third-party owned trademarks typically in exchange for royalties on sales. These agreements typically contain a one to three-year term and contractual payment amounts required to be paid by the Company.
Governmental Regulations
We operate in a complex regulatory and legal environment that exposes us to regulatory, compliance and litigation risks that could materially affect our operations and financial results. Specifically, we are subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies and authorities, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Department of Justice, Department of Treasury, Federal Trade Commission, Customs and Border Protection, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, SEC, Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and Environmental Protection Agency and comparable state and local agencies.
Laws and regulations affecting our business may change, sometimes frequently and significantly, as a result of political, economic, social or other events. Some of the federal, state or local laws and regulations that affect us include but are not limited to:
•consumer product safety, product liability or consumer protection laws;
•laws related to advertising, marketing, pricing and selling our products, including but not limited to firearms, ammunition, and related accessories;
•labor and employment laws, including wage and hour laws;

We sell firearms, ammunition, and related accessories. Firearms represented approximately 6% of our net sales in 2021. Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the procurement, transportation, storage, distribution and sale and marketing of firearms, ammunition, and related accessories, including the regulations governing the performance of federally and state mandated procedures for determining customer firearm purchase eligibility (such as age and residency verification, background checks and proper completion of required paperwork). In the future, there may be increased federal, state or local regulation and enforcement affecting the sale of firearms, ammunition, and related accessories, including taxation or restrictions on the type of firearms and ammunition available for retail sale, which could reduce our sales and profitability.
