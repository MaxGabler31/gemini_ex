Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
Our executive offices are located at Suite 201, 42 Edward Street, George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and our telephone number is +1 (345) 749-7570. Our corporate website address is www.oxbridgeaq.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.
 
Company History
 
On April 12, 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 2,875,000 Class B ordinary shares (our “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. Our Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a business combination. The number of founder shares issued was based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding Class A ordinary shares and our Class B ordinary shares (collectively, our “ordinary shares”) upon completion of our initial public offering (the “IPO”).
 
On August 16, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 10,000,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 and incurring offering costs of approximately $6,624,000, inclusive of approximately $3,500,000 in deferred underwriting commissions. The underwriter was granted a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the initial public offering to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. On August 16, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and, purchased an additional 1,500,000 Over-Allotment Units, generating additional gross proceeds of $15,000,000, and incurring additional offering costs of $825,000, inclusive of approximately $525,000 of deferred underwriting commissions. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A ordinary shares at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 5,760,000 warrants to the sponsor and Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), the underwriter in our initial public offering (the “private placement warrants”), at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,760,000. An aggregate of $116,725,000 from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”) such that the trust account held $116,725,000 at the time of closing of the IPO. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
On September 30, 2021, we announced that, commencing October 1, 2021, holders of the 11,500,000 units sold in the IPO may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “OXACU” and the Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “OXAC” and “OXACW,” respectively.

Our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov) contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We believe that the blockchain technology, artificial intelligence and insurtech sectors are highly fragmented and evolving quickly. Our business strategy is to identify and consummate an initial business combination with a disruptive and differentiated technology company that focuses on blockchain technology, artificial intelligence or insurtech technologies. We will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value. We may also look at earlier stage companies that exhibit the potential to change the industries in which they participate and which will offer the potential of sustained high levels of revenue growth and path to profitability.
 
We intend to employ a thematic acquisition strategy, and are focused on long-term shareholder value growth and building a leading franchise. Our strategy is to:
 
● target a company with disruptive and differentiated technology;
 
● fully leverage the industry experience and broad network of our executive officers, board members and advisors to identify potential investment opportunities and successfully execute acquisition transactions;
 
● deliver creative approaches to transaction sourcing, while exercising pricing discipline; and
 
● utilize an understanding of global financial markets and events, financing, restructuring and overall corporate strategy options.
 
Our business combination strategy will leverage the following attributes of our management team:
 
● Broad network, proprietary contacts, corporate relationships including financing providers and investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, accounting firms, target management teams and companies or individuals that represent sellers);
 
● Industry experience developed through operating, managing, marketing and growing businesses in the insurance industry;
 
● Investing and building companies in the insurance and InsurTech sector with unique market insights;
 
● Substantial experience in navigating the challenges of operating public companies; and
 
● Engaging with public market analysts and investors to help companies better communicate their business model, opportunity and strategy to maximize value for their shareholders.
 
In addition to assisting in the sourcing of a potential transaction, members of our management team may join the acquired company as a board member or in a senior executive capacity or assist in the operation of the acquired company in order to enhance shareholder value by improving the operational performance of the combined company and undertaking broader strategic initiatives.

Business Combination Criteria
 
Our intent is to seek potential target businesses globally. The maturity and judgment of our team will guide our acquisition process. When potential targets are being evaluated, we expect to use the following, non-exclusive criteria listed below for determining opportunities. We will use these criteria when evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet all or some of these criteria:

● | Is Established and of Sufficient Scale. We will seek to acquire an established business with an enterprise value suitable for the size of our company, and without excessive leverage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Has a Defensible Market Position. We will seek to acquire a business that has a defensible position within a target market as a result of a differentiated technology, distribution capabilities, customer service or other competitive advantages. 
● | Generates Stable Free Cash-Flow. We will seek to acquire a business that has historically generated, or has the near-term potential to generate, strong and sustainable free cash flow. 
● | Is Sourced Through our Proprietary Channels. We expect to acquire a business that we source by leveraging the extensive network of our management team and do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes. 
● | Can Benefit from our Capabilities. We will seek to acquire a business whose performance and operations can benefit from the collective capabilities of our sponsor, founders and management team and their expertise to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target, including improving operations with enhanced managing capabilities and growing InsurTech and disruptive blockchain companies. 
● | Has a Committed and Capable Management Team. We will seek to acquire a business with a professional management team whose interests are aligned with those of our shareholders and complement the expertise of our management team. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target business’s management team by recruiting additional talent through our network of contacts. 
● | Has the Potential to Grow Through Further Acquisition Opportunities. We will seek to acquire a business that has the potential to grow through additional acquisitions. 
● | Has publicly traded peers. We will seek to acquire a business that has publicly traded comparable companies that operate in a similar industry sector or which have similar operating metrics which may help establish that the valuation of our initial business combination is attractive relative to such public peers; 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
 
Additional Disclosures
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
Each of our directors and officers presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.

Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will also provide that any initial business combination must be approved by at least 75% of our Board of Directors.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
Extension of Time to Complete Business Combination
 
We will have until November 16, 2022 to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by November 16, 2022, we will, by resolution of our Board of Directors if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months up to twice (for a total of 21 months through May 16, 2023 to complete a business combination), (each an “Extension Period”), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. In connection with any such extension, public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination for an additional three months, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the trust account $ $1,150,000 on or prior to the date of the deadline. We will only be able to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months twice (for a total of six months). We will issue a press release announcing each extension, at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we will issue a press release the day after the deadline, announcing whether the funds have been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are obligated to fund the trust account in order to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination, but our sponsor will not be obligated to extend such time.

Facilities
 
We maintains our principal executive offices at Suite 201, 42 Edward Street, George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. We pays our sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services pursuant to the terms of an administrative services agreement between us and our sponsor. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We considers our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we has completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.
Competition
 
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our initial public offering and private placement warrants, if we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.15 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable.

We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or December 31, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
