ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until: (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,070,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from:
 
Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which requires companies to hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
The requirement to provide in any registration statement periodic report or other report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K or selected financial data under Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period before the earliest audited period presented in our initial registration statement;
 
Compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies;
 
The requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide auditor attestation of our internal controls and procedures; and
 
Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, or an expanded auditor report and any other PCAOB rules subsequently adopted, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines the new rules are necessary for protecting the public.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
 
New Leap was incorporated in Delaware on June 1, 2017. Most of the activity through December 31, 2018 involved incorporation efforts, preparation for the Company’s public Offering and building our website.
 
We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern.
 
New Leap focuses on an online market and community connecting private U.S. companies and companies which are publicly traded in the U.S. (both U.S. and foreign incorporated) with potential investors from all over the world, except for U.S. residents. The goal is to provide these companies with exposure to as many potential investors from outside the U.S. as possible, while providing those potential investors with different investment opportunities in the foregoing companies. Potential investors will be able to click on any company they would like to know more about and get access to its marketing information and legal and financial disclosures. 
 
New Leap plans to match up potential investors from all over the world, except for U.S. residents with private U.S. companies and companies which are publicly traded in the U.S. (both U.S. and foreign incorporated). The goal is to use the crowdfunding trend in order to make private investments in such companies more accessible to non-U.S. investors on one hand and allow easier access to capital for these companies on the other. We will not allow U.S. persons access to the materials presented by the companies offering their securities on our website. Anyone trying to gain access to the offering materials posted on our website will first need to fill out a questionnaire which will include a question about the country of residence. Anyone answering “U.S.A” or any of its states will be prohibited from gaining access to the page showing the offering materials of the presenting companies. We intend to start developing a website following completion of this offering. For this purpose our intention is to use a third party vendor which can provide both design and programming services.

All securities will bear a legend indicating that the securities are "restricted securities" and may not be sold in the U.S. absent an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of such securities or an available exemption from such registration requirement. 
 
New Leap will keep a complete audit trail of investments in the companies presenting on its website. Funds committed for an investment will be kept in an escrow account until the company’s funding goal is reached. Upon reaching such goal, funds will be transferred from the escrow account to the company’s bank account while simultaneously stock certificates will be delivered to the investors. Should the funding goal not be reached until the deadline of the offering, funds would immediately be returned to the investors.
 
Business Model
 
New Leap has two revenue models: Transaction Success Fees and Advertising Fees.
 
Transaction Revenue Model
 
New Leap's web platform would be designed to allow a meet up between potential interested investors and U.S. private companies and companies which are publicly traded in the U.S. (both U.S. and foreign incorporated) looking to raise funds via equity-based crowdfunding. Such companies interested in using our platform for such purpose will post their offering materials on our website so that potential investors having access to the website could review them and decide whether they are interested in participating in the offering by making an investment. We will receive a certain percentage ranging between 5% to 10% as a transaction success fee for each fundraising campaign that reaches its funding goal. This certain percentage will be applied to the total amount raised and will be paid out of the escrow account immediately upon completion of a transaction. We will be entitled to a transaction success fee only for fundraising campaigns that reach their funding goals as such goals are set by the companies launching these campaigns. We will not employ tiered funding goals. 
Advertising Revenue Model
 
New Leap would also consider allowing advertising on its website. We expect that if we will manage to generate meaningful traffic to our website, various market participants will be interested in exploring advertising opportunities with us.
Marketing & Growth Strategy
 
New Leap will grow the pool of companies looking to utilize its platform for equity-based crowdfunding by talking with, and presenting the opportunity to, startups and early stage companies as well as small more mature companies which need additional funds for growth, expansion and acquisitions. New Leap will grow its pool of potential investors looking to explore the investment opportunities presented on our website by advertising on economic portals which are widely followed by retail investors. New Leap will look for other channels for exposure such as writing columns about equity-based crowdfunding on widely-spread financial newspapers and websites.
Market Overview
 
Equity-based crowdfunding refers to the pooling of small capital investments from a large number of investors to finance a new or expanding business venture. In return, those investors receive a small stake in the company and expect to earn a profit if the company succeeds. The concept of crowdfunding is not new. Charities, social groups, churches and non-profit organizations have raised funds using similar methods for many years. Websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo brought crowdfunding to the internet by allowing startup companies and entrepreneurs to accept monetary “donations” from project “backers.” The difference between these crowdfunding campaigns and those targeted by New Leap, however, is that investors using New Leap's web platform will be able to purchase a security interest in the company in which they are investing.
 
The equity-based crowdfunding contemplated by New Leap will be made under Regulation S (Rules 901-905 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).

Competition
 
We are currently not aware of other crowdfunding platforms focused on Regulation S offerings of securities. However, we consider U.S. investment-based crowdfunding platforms, which present companies offering securities based on Rule 506(c), Section 4(a)(6) and Regulation A+ of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended to be competitors to some extent. 
Regulatory Environment
 
The enactment of the JOBS Act in 2012 led to numerous regulatory changes that support investment-based crowdfunding in the U.S. Since New Leap, however, plans to provide a web platform for securities offerings to be made outside the U.S., it will not have companies using its services rely on these post-JOBS Act regulatory changes, but rather rely on Regulation S, which excludes securities offerings made outside the U.S. from the purview of the registration requirements of Section 5 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Companies using our web platform will be required, however, to meet the requirements of Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Intellectual Property
 
We have no patents or trademarks.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had one employee which serves as our president, and chief executive officer, Mr. Ostashinsky. During calendar year ending December 31, 2019 (depending on financing and available working capital), Mr. Ostashinsky will devote at least ten (10) hours a week to us and may increase the number of hours as necessary. Mr. Ostashinsky is under no contractual agreement with the Company. However, our president, and chief executive officer’s current plan is to provide all administrative and planning work as well as initial marketing efforts on his own without any cash compensation while he seeks other sources of funding for the Company and its business plan.
Property
 
Our office and mailing address is 8 Derech Hameshi St., Ganei Tikva, Israel 5591179. The space is provided to us by Mr. Ostashinsky, who incurs no incremental costs as a result of our using the space. Therefore, he does not charge us for its use. There is no written lease agreement. The current use of the space property is minimal.
Litigation
 
We are not party to any pending, or to our knowledge, threatened litigation of any type.
