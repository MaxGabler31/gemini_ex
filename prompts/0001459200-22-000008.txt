ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Alarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, access control, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 100 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.
Our solutions are delivered through an established network of over 10,900 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, gunshot detection sensors, gateway modules and smart thermostats. 
Contracts with our service provider partners establish pricing for access to our platform solutions and for the sale of hardware. These service provider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners typically enter into contracts with our subscribers, which our service provider partners have indicated range from three to five years in length. Our service provider partners are free to market and sell our products under their own guidelines at prices to the consumer that they establish independently. We believe that our network of service providers and the length of our service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust SaaS platforms and over 20 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.
We have experienced significant growth since our company's inception in 2000. We generated total revenue of $749.0 million, $618.0 million and $502.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our SaaS and license revenue was $460.4 million, $393.3 million and $337.4 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 16.8%. We also generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $52.3 million, $77.9 million and $53.5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, of $142.5 million, $125.3 million and $108.3 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See the "Non-GAAP Measures" section of Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Our Solutions and Integrated Platforms
Our solutions are designed to make both residential and commercial properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our technology platforms support all participants in what we refer to as the connected property market. This market includes the residential and commercial property owners who subscribe to our services, the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who install and maintain our solutions.
The Alarm.com platform enables our service provider partners to deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, access control, energy management and wellness solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers.
Subscriber Solutions
Interactive Security 
Interactive security is the entry point for most of our smart home and business subscribers. Our dedicated, two-way cellular connection between the property and our platforms is designed to be tamper resistant and to meet the high reliability standards for life safety services. Our platform integrates with monitoring stations used by our service providers to monitor the system 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and coordinate emergency response as needed. Subscribers can seamlessly connect to our services to control and monitor their security systems, as well as to Internet of Things, or IoT, devices including door locks, garage doors, thermostats and video cameras, through our family of mobile apps, websites and engagement platforms like voice control through Siri Shortcuts, Amazon Echo and Google Home, wearable devices like the Apple Watch and TV applications such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. 
The capabilities associated with this solution include:
◦Real-Time Alerts and Always-On Monitoring. Whether the security system is armed or disarmed, we continuously monitor sensors in the property and can keep subscribers aware of system events in all kinds of situations. Notifications for any type of system event are delivered through push notifications, short message service, or SMS, or email, based on the subscriber's preference. Our proprietary algorithms help safeguard connected properties by continuously monitoring devices and sensors and learning the unique activity patterns in a property. When unexpected activity is detected, the subscriber is automatically notified. Facial recognition technology enhances unexpected activity alerts by enabling certain security panels with built-in cameras to proactively monitor for unauthorized sharing or theft of an authorized user's security system codes.
◦Alarm Transmission. We transmit alarm signals from monitored properties through our cloud platforms to approximately 1,000 third-party central monitoring stations staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week with live operators ready to initiate emergency response.
◦Smart Signal. With a single button push in the Alarm.com mobile app, subscribers can quickly verify an alarm to help expedite emergency response or easily cancel a false alarm. By communicating critical information directly to the monitoring station, Smart Signal can help enhance the overall value of the professional monitoring services associated with Alarm.com systems and reduce false alarm dispatches. In addition, home or business owners who need emergency assistance at their property can send a one-touch panic signal directly from their mobile app to their monitoring station. 
◦Flex IO. Flex IO is a versatile, completely wireless device that extends awareness across a property and to assets in any location. The battery-powered LTE Category M device creates new applications of our technology that existing hub-connected sensors cannot address. Flex IO can be installed easily on a backyard gate, detached garage, remote storage unit, or it can be tethered to other assets like a boat, tractor or lawn mower. Flex IO triggers activity notifications to subscribers as well as video recordings when activity is detected, or an asset is moved.
◦Connected Car. Our battery-powered, cellular Connected Car solution extends smart security beyond the home, enabling subscribers to track their vehicle's location, view engine status and analyze fuel efficiency from the Alarm.com mobile app. Subscribers enjoy peace of mind with real-time driver safety alerts, diagnostic alerts and unexpected activity alerts. Fully integrated with the Alarm.com platform, Connected Car provides smarter, more responsive alerts and more intelligent automation than standalone solutions.
◦Wellness. Our technology intelligently monitors quality of life through a suite of connected sensors and devices, and delivers proactive insights into activities of daily living. With alerts about changes in behavior that can indicate emerging quality of life issues, family members and homecare and senior living providers can address issues before they escalate and deliver more efficient care.
Video Monitoring and Video Analytics
Our video monitoring solution can provide a direct live-view into a property, identify and capture footage of critical events and provide visual peace of mind. We offer indoor and outdoor video cameras for residential and commercial properties at varying price points so that our service providers can engage a range of consumers with our services. We also provide a doorbell video camera solution that supports two-way audio with guests at the door, as well as video management software and cameras for enterprise commercial applications through our OpenEye business. 
The capabilities associated with our video monitoring solution include:
◦Video Analytics. Our video analytics engine provides object classification and object tracking technology that can distinguish between people, vehicles and animals, determine an object's direction of movement and measure the duration of activity. Subscribers can selectively control and manage notifications and assign virtual zones and multi-directional "tripwires" so they can monitor their home or business for highly specific activity. Perimeter Guard is the latest enhancement to our video analytics capabilities and can proactively identify and engage would-be intruders before they can threaten physical property.
◦Video Doorbell. Alarm.com offers a full line of video doorbell options with a diversity of price points. From a single screen on the Alarm.com mobile app, subscribers can see and speak with visitors and control their door locks. The Alarm.com 770 video doorbell operates proprietary video analytics software that can quickly and accurately detect visitors while reducing unwanted alerts, such as those caused by passing vehicle traffic or swaying branches. A touch-free capability immediately activates the doorbell chime when a visitor is detected, eliminating the need to physically press a doorbell button. 
◦Intelligent Integration. Alarm.com’s video surveillance solution works intelligently with other devices and sensors in the property. Subscribers can create intelligent rules to capture video clips of important events to enhance security and privacy. 
◦Live Streaming. Subscribers can securely access live video feeds through the web and mobile apps at any time.
◦Secure Cloud Storage. Video clips are uploaded to our cloud-based storage system for secure storage and remote viewing.
◦Video Alerts. Smart clips can be automatically sent via SMS, push notifications or email as soon as they are recorded.
Intelligent Automation and Energy Management
Our solution provides enhanced monitoring and control for a large ecosystem of connected devices, including thermostats, lights, locks, power meters, shades and other devices. Increasing awareness of energy usage and providing intelligent control over connected devices enables subscribers to create personalized automation rules and schedules. We believe our solutions can reduce energy waste as well as increase comfort and convenience for our subscribers. The capabilities associated with this solution include:
◦Scenes. A customizable scenes button in the Alarm.com app can adjust multiple devices in the property with a single command. For example, a homeowner leaving the house can arm the security system, lock the front door, close the garage door and adjust the thermostat with a single command.
◦Video Analytics Triggers. A robust set of automation rules allows our subscribers to customize automations to respond when certain activity is detected by their video monitoring solution. For example, subscribers can create a rule that if a person is detected in their backyard at night, certain lights should turn on. 
◦Smart Thermostat Schedules. Advanced algorithms can learn the unique activity patterns in a property by analyzing sensor and device data. Our solution can then recommend thermostat schedules that have the potential to increase energy efficiency when the property is not likely to be occupied.
◦Responsive Savings. Smart thermostats connected to our platforms can automatically respond to sensors and other devices in the property to conserve energy. For example, when the security system is armed away, an arming state used when the property is not occupied, the thermostat can automatically adjust to save energy. Additionally, if a window is open for a period of time, the smart thermostat can adjust to an efficiency setting and alert the property owners. 
◦Precision Comfort. Remote temperature sensors enable a subscriber to manage comfort in a specific area within their property. For example, a homeowner can set a desired temperature for a child's nursery to improve the child’s comfort. Subscribers can easily customize detailed schedules and rules to have the right temperature in the right location at the right time.
◦Energy Usage Monitoring. Real-time and historical energy usage and solar energy production data for the entire property and individual devices can give subscribers greater insight into the property’s energy profile and encourage more efficient use of energy-consuming devices.
◦HVAC Monitoring Service. Our Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, or HVAC, monitoring service works with select high-efficiency heating and cooling systems and allows HVAC contractors to remotely monitor and manage sophisticated residential and light commercial heating and cooling systems.
◦Places Feature. The Places feature uses a phone’s geo-location to determine when to notify a subscriber of specific system conditions, or to automatically adjust system settings. Subscribers who enable the Places feature can be notified if they leave home and forgot to lock a door, close the garage door, arm their security system or close a window. Additionally, smart thermostats and lights can be automatically adjusted based on the subscriber's location. Subscribers can create multiple geo-fences and customize the opt-in feature to meet their specific needs.
◦Demand Response Programs. Utilities can reduce or shift power consumption during peak demand periods by accessing connected thermostats and other connected devices and appliances that participate in the utility's program. Managed at scale, these voluntary programs can significantly reduce costs for utilities. In addition to enabling subscribers to participate in these programs through our energy management solution, our EnergyHub subsidiary aggregates a diverse set of smart thermostats, connected water heaters, batteries and electric vehicles, enabling utilities to leverage these devices as an enterprise-grade, grid resource through EnergyHub's SaaS platform.
◦Whole Home Water Safety Solution. Our comprehensive whole home water safety solution helps subscribers conserve water and protects properties from a full range of water-related damage. Integrated with Alarm.com’s Smart Water Valve + Meter, our solution can monitor water usage, detect both low- and high-volume leaks and automatically shut off the property’s water supply. Working with other connected devices in the Alarm.com ecosystem, our solution can also alert the homeowner about conditions that can lead to frozen and burst pipes, intelligently manage humidity levels and notify homeowners if a sump pump fails.
Commercial Solutions
In addition to our residential solutions, we offer a full range of commercial security services that uniquely address the requirements of small, medium and enterprise scale businesses. 
Alarm.com for Business, our security solution for small and medium businesses that range from single-site to multi-location businesses, combines intelligent intrusion detection, video surveillance, access control and energy management into a single solution through Alarm.com's app and online interfaces. Our solution streamlines business operations, enhances property security and awareness, saves energy and provides insights into employee and customer activity. Additionally, business insights reporting provides actionable intelligence, including open and close trends by location, peak periods of activity and customer traffic and energy savings opportunities. Key benefits of the commercial offering include:
◦Commercial Grade Video Solutions. Connected commercial cameras deeply integrate with the security and access control systems, capturing clips as activity occurs, which are uploaded to our cloud-based platform for secure storage and remote viewing through the web or our mobile app. Subscribers can receive real-time alerts and video clips if the alarm goes off, a door is unlocked, or unexpected activity occurs outside of normal business hours. Business owners can assess the situation and take appropriate action at any time of day and from any location.
◦Commercial Video Analytics. Business Activity Analytics can help improve and optimize business operations. Commercial subscribers can intelligently monitor customer and employee activity, including occupancy tracking, people counting, queue monitoring, crowd gathering and heat mapping. Real-time notifications and activity reporting can help streamline customer flows, reduce wait times, measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and enforce occupancy and social distancing limits.
◦Smarter Access Control. Our Smarter Access Control solution streamlines access management and helps solve many of the challenges faced by small business owners with an array of always-on operational tools that can improve property control, security and awareness. From a single web view, subscribers can add and delete users, manage access points and user permissions and define schedules across multiple locations and security partitions. Leveraging advanced algorithms, our Smarter Access Control solution intelligently learns the activity patterns of users and access points for single or multiple property installations, detects unexpected events and alerts the subscriber of the irregular activity. 
◦Multi-site Management. Commercial subscribers with multiple business locations and access points can easily manage Alarm.com’s commercial solutions from a single enterprise dashboard. They can customize video feeds to monitor multiple properties and use sophisticated rules, user permissions and schedules to manage access across multiple locations and security partitions. Business owners and managers can add and delete access credentials for new and departing employees and provide limited access to third parties such as delivery personnel, without calling their service provider or worrying about spare keys. 
◦Energy Savings. Our smarter thermostats help subscribers reduce energy costs automatically, even if someone forgets to adjust the temperature when they are closing up at the end of the day, generating a return on investment.
◦Protection for Valuables and Inventory. Quick notifications keep business owners in the know about individuals entering or exiting the back office, the supply room, or any other specific rooms or doors.
◦Temperature Monitoring. Our new temperature monitoring solution provides monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, real-time alerts and historical temperature reporting to support the temperature control needs of restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies and other single-system and multi-location commercial customers. Business owners receive alerts for out-of-range temperatures so they can quickly prevent unsafe conditions, reduce spoilage and repair malfunctioning equipment.
◦Daily Safeguards. Smarter business security intelligently keeps business locations secure while minimizing false alarms. Subscribers can specify a time for the security system to automatically adjust to an armed state each day. The system will arm itself only after a certain period of inactivity in the property.
◦Proactive Awareness. Unexpected activity alerts provide business owners and managers with the early identification of activity such as unexpected entry after hours, or doors propped open that could cause energy waste or safety concerns, and help business owners quickly respond to problematic situations. Alarm.com provides a time stamped log of which users armed or disarmed the system or entered the property using their keycard. 
◦Professionally Supported and Low Cost of Ownership. Unlike traditional commercial security services, Alarm.com’s connected solutions are cloud-based and do not require additional IT resources. Smarter business security powered by Alarm.com is supported by our authorized service provider partners from start to finish, with installation, configuration and technical support included.

According to research data published by Strategy Analytics in 2021, the global installed base for smart home devices will grow at a 22.7% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2025. We believe that this trend highlights a significant opportunity for market participants, including Alarm.com and our service provider partners.
Our Technology
Cloud Services Platform
Our internal engineering teams have designed and developed our core technology. As an industry leader, we believe we have robust cloud service platforms for the intelligently connected property. Our cloud services platforms manage communication with the system at the property, intelligently direct alerts and notifications, learn patterns and identify anomalies and manage video processing and storage. Additionally, our platforms enable device integrations through application program interfaces, or APIs, and offer our service provider partners extensive workflow efficiency services.
Since our inception, we have utilized a multi-tenant SaaS platform architecture to enable rapid innovation in a scalable environment. Our platforms are architected to scale and our technology team has developed proprietary cloud-based applications to support our service provider partners and subscribers. Security and life safety are mission critical components of our service offering; thus, we are committed to high reliability standards. We operate our Alarm.com cloud services platform through two redundant network operations centers located in Phoenix, Arizona and Ashburn, Virginia. Each center is designed to run the entire Alarm.com platform independent of the other.
Cybersecurity
The solutions we provide rely on technology and data, and cybersecurity is a crucial part of our business. We conduct our business in the United States and are expanding internationally in various other countries. Conducting expanded international operations subjects us to additional risks, including our exposure to cyber-attacks. We dedicate substantial resources to the protection of our data, systems and infrastructure. We have implemented and continue to maintain a comprehensive information security program consisting of policies, procedures, and technology designed to maintain the privacy, security and integrity of our data, confidential information, systems and networks. Among other things, the program includes controls designed to limit and monitor access to our systems, networks and data, prevent inappropriate or unauthorized access or modification, and monitor for threats or vulnerability. 
Hardware and Manufacturing
We are involved in designing and manufacturing various types of hardware that enable our solutions, including:
◦Cellular Communication Modules. We offer cellular communications modules that are tightly integrated with security system control panels, sensors and other devices. We regularly pioneer technical advances in this space, including the expansion of our deployment of security services hardware with 4G LTE and LTE CAT-M cellular network connections. All of our modules, designed by our device engineering team and manufactured in the United States by a contract manufacturing partner, provide a dedicated and fully managed two-way cellular connection between the subscriber’s property and our cloud platforms. The modules run our proprietary firmware and enable:
•Real-time analysis of system events reported by security sensors and other devices.
•Local automation rule execution.
•The management of message transmissions to our cloud platforms for further processing.
◦Flex IO. A versatile, completely wireless device that extends awareness across a property and to assets in any location. It can easily install on a backyard gate, detached garage, remote storage unit, or it can be tethered to other assets like a boat, tractor or lawn mower, and triggers activity notifications to subscribers as well as video recordings when activity is detected, or an asset is moved.
◦Image Sensor. Our image sensor, designed by our device engineering team and manufactured in the United States by a contract manufacturing partner, is a wireless, battery-operated, passive infrared motion sensor that captures images based on various system triggers. These images are transmitted by our cellular communications module to our cloud platforms. Subscribers can securely view images through our website and mobile apps, as well as customize their notification settings to have new images automatically sent via SMS and email.
◦Video Cameras. We offer a suite of high definition, Internet Protocol, video cameras and video doorbells to enable our video monitoring services. Our indoor, outdoor, and video doorbell cameras include options for night vision capabilities as well as wireless or Power over Ethernet communication features. We also offer a network video recording device, the SVR, for on premise, continuous video recording seamlessly connected to our cloud platforms for remote playback through our user interfaces. All of these video products and SVRs are specified to our platforms through proprietary software.
◦Alarm.com Smart Thermostats. Our Smart Thermostats combine elegant design, sophisticated cloud services and advanced energy management features. They were designed by our Building36 and device engineering teams to work in concert with other devices in the connected property. Our Smart Thermostats communicate with the Alarm.com communications module via Z-wave and support both battery power and common wire power installation.
•Remote temperature sensors can pair with our Smart Thermostats to enable temperature set points for any room in the property, not just the room where the thermostats are installed. Our Smart Thermostats support multiple remote temperature sensors for precise temperature control for a residential or commercial property.
•We designed our Smart Thermostats to be easy to install and support remotely. The MobileTech app assists in proper wiring and installation and Remote Toolkit enables remote access to the thermostat settings for easy troubleshooting and support.
◦Smart Water Valve + Meter. Our Smart Water Valve + Meter is an innovative addition to the Alarm.com Water Management solution, identifying low and high-volume water leaks and constantly monitoring overall water use and current usage rates in homes and businesses. Freeze and winter plumbing alerts include a reminder to winterize external water supplies and notifications triggered by local weather conditions when both water and outdoor temperatures create a greater risk for frozen pipes. Deep integration with the Alarm.com platform leverages intelligence and insights to help reduce the risk of losses from water emergencies, while also improving water conservation efforts.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platforms and applications, support our technology infrastructure, develop new capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing. We expect to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts to expand the capabilities of our technology. Our research and development of new products and services is a multidisciplinary effort across our product management, program management, software engineering, device engineering, quality engineering, configuration management and network operations teams.
Service Provider Network
Our trusted service provider partner network is key in driving the adoption of connected home and commercial solutions. Our solutions are sold, installed, and serviced by a network of independent licensed, professional service provider partners. Our channel network currently consists of over 10,900 active service provider partners, including smaller local providers, larger regional providers and national service providers with thousands of employees. We have also seen growth in other areas of our channel network, including new providers in the intelligent automation, HVAC, property management and insurance markets.
We believe this highly trusted, established network is a core strength that enables an efficient and scalable customer acquisition model, allowing us to focus on technology innovation. We also believe that the combination of our solutions and our service provider partners’ expertise is the most effective way to drive mass market adoption of the intelligently connected property.
The traditional security and home automation market is highly fragmented with approximately 15,000 security service providers nationally. According to the Barnes Buchanan 2022 Security Alarm Industry Overview and Update report, the top 5 dealers represented approximately 34% of all industry recurring monthly revenue in 2021. The distribution of revenue among our service provider partners is reflective of the industry overall. ADT LLC represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Subscribers
Our platforms currently support millions of residential and commercial subscribers. We define the number of subscribers as the number of residential or commercial properties to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. A subscriber who subscribes to one of our service level packages as well as one or more of our a la carte add-ons is counted as one subscriber. Our number of subscribers does not include the customers of our service provider partners to whom we license our intellectual property, as they do not utilize one of our SaaS platforms. Our subscriber acquisition cost payback period has historically been one year or less.
Sales and Marketing
The goal of our sales team is to help our service provider partners succeed in selling, installing and supporting our full suite of solutions. Our sales team is also responsible for recruiting new service provider partners to Alarm.com. We also have a global business development team dedicated to establishing new service provider and distribution relationships in international markets.
Our marketing team is focused on empowering our service provider partners to effectively promote and sell our solutions. We design, develop and provide end-to-end marketing services including tools and content for lifecycle marketing to help our service providers build awareness, create interest, activate subscribers, develop and maintain the ongoing customer relationship, increase customer engagement, and generate upsell and referral opportunities. While we offer tools and services to assist our service providers when they are marketing to potential subscribers, we do not control or influence the marketing activities performed by our service providers, as they are free to select the marketing tools they believe will be the most effective. Our contracts with our service providers require that they comply with all applicable rules and laws when engaging in marketing activities. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities through our Alarm.com Academy, including in-person training courses and an online learning management system.
We believe our sales and marketing approach enables us to expand our breadth of service providers, provide highly customized services and scale quickly.
Service Provider Support
We support the full suite of software and hardware products on the Alarm.com platform through a highly trained and experienced team of professionals based in the United States. We primarily support our service provider partners. Our service provider partners, in turn, support their customers, who are our subscribers. To that end, subscribers occasionally reach us directly with support needs and we either assist the subscriber directly or, when appropriate, route the subscriber to the appropriate service provider partner for additional assistance.
We offer high-quality support to our service providers via phone, web ticketing and email. With every interaction, our team is committed to exceptional customer satisfaction and industry-leading response times. We use a tiered structure to efficiently escalate and resolve issues of varying complexity and to scale our support organization as we grow. Our staff is multilingual and we continue to grow our language capabilities to support our international expansion.
Our Competition
The market in which we participate for connected property solutions is fragmented, highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to continue from existing competitors as well as potential new market entrants in the interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management markets. Our current competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected property with interactive security, including Alula (formed following the merger of ipDatatel, LLC and Resolution Products, LLC), Avigilon Corporation, Brivo Inc., Digital Monitoring Products Inc., Eagle Eye Networks Inc., Honeywell International Inc., Resideo Technologies Inc., SecureNet Technologies, LLC, Telular Corporation (acquired by AMETEK, Inc.), United Technologies Corporation, and Verkada Inc., which sell solutions to service providers, cable operators, technology retailers and other residential and commercial automation providers. We also compete with interactive, monitored security solutions sold directly to subscribers and may also be sold through our partners, including companies like Abode Systems, Inc., Arlo Technologies, Inc., Cove Smart, LLC, Scout Security, Inc. and SimpliSafe, Inc. In addition, our service provider partners compete with security solutions sold directly to subscribers, as well as managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and broadband companies like, Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and Rogers Communications, Inc., and providers of point products, including Google Inc.'s Nest Labs, Inc. Amazon.com offers Amazon Home Services security packages with bundled equipment and professional installation, and Amazon Key, a security camera and smart lock integration feature. Ring Inc., owned by Amazon.com, offers a connected video doorbell, video cameras and an integrated security system, Ring Alarm. Samsung's SmartThings offers a security system and a home automation and awareness hub. Arlo Technologies, Inc. and Wyze Labs, Inc. offers connected video cameras, a connected video doorbell, and smart security devices. Apple Inc. offers a feature that allows some manufacturers’ connected devices and accessories, including video cameras and doorbells, to be controlled through its HomeKit service available in Apple’s iOS operating system. Additionally, Canary and other companies offer all in one video monitoring and awareness devices. In addition, we may compete with other large and small technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market.
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and automation, wellness, and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business. We believe the principal competitive factors in the connected property market include the following:
•simplicity and ease of use;
•ability to offer persistent awareness, control, and intelligent automation;
•breadth of features and functionality provided;
•flexibility of the solutions and ability to personalize for the individual consumer;
•compatibility with a wide selection of third-party devices;
•pricing, affordability, and accessibility;
•sales reach and local installation and support capabilities; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Additionally, we believe that our cloud-based software platforms, intelligently connected property solutions, and proven scalability help further differentiate us from competitors. Nevertheless, our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and broader distribution channels than we do.
Our Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete effectively depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements and other contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2021, we owned 544 issued United States utility patents, one issued United States design patent, eight issued Canadian patents, 11 issued Australian patents, among others, and these patents are scheduled to expire between 2022 and 2040. We continue to broaden our intellectual property portfolio and file patent applications and as of December 31, 2021, we had 285 pending utility patent applications and 38 pending provisional patent applications filed in the United States. We also had two pending international patent applications and 158 international patent applications pending under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The claims for which we have sought patent protection apply to both our platforms and solutions. Our patent and patent applications generally apply to the features and functions of our platforms, and solutions and the applications associated with our platforms. We also have, and may be required to seek, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software.
We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. We have 20 registered trademarks in the United States, including Alarm.com and the Alarm.com logo and design, and eight registered trademarks in Canada, one in the United Kingdom and one in the European Union.
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development to enter into agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, concepts, processes, improvements and other works generated by them on our behalf are our intellectual property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim in those works.
We expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. We have brought infringement claims against third parties in the past and may do so in the future to defend our intellectual property position. In addition, from time to time, we may face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our service providers or subscribers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Matters
Environmental
To operate long-term, we need to ensure that our local communities and the natural environment are thriving. To help meet these goals we intend to continue promoting, providing and investing in the further development of solutions that can help reduce energy waste and facilitate water conservation. These include demand response programs, smart thermostats, energy management solutions, Smart Water Valve + Meter device and advanced functionality within the Alarm.com app. 
Our demand response programs manage over 700,000 connected devices for more than 60 energy utilities in North America. These programs support energy utilities as they pursue aggressive clean energy goals.
Our lineup of smart thermostats and intelligent energy management solutions can automatically adjust to reduce energy waste in residential and commercial properties. These solutions can change a thermostat’s temperature set-point based on subscriber location, property occupancy and activity patterns, and if a door or window is left open for too long. To facilitate wide-spread adoption of energy management technology, we developed many of these capabilities to also work with smart thermostats manufactured by third party companies. 
The Alarm.com mobile app includes customizable scenes buttons that can assist in increasing the potential for energy efficiency by adjusting multiple devices in the property with a single command. For example, a homeowner can turn on the fan, raise or lower shades, turn on or off lights and adjust the thermostat with a single command. Commercial users can create automated schedules to secure a property and automatically adjust the thermostat at a specified time.
Our recently launched Smart Water Valve + Meter device is part of a comprehensive water management solution. Two on-board flow sensors monitor water usage to facilitate water conservation behavior. The device can also detect burst pipes, major leaks, and wasteful slow persistent drips, and can respond by informing the property owners of opportunities to reduce water waste, or as needed, by automatically shutting off the water supply to quickly protect properties from damage.
Our commitment extends to the buildings in which our employees work. Many of our offices use LED lighting with sensors that turn off the lights when motion is not detected and several of our offices are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, certified or Energy Star® certified, which indicates that the buildings help conserve energy and limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, several of our offices have building recycling programs, including programs specific to batteries and electronics.
During 2021, we created a Sustainability Team that is focused on integrating sustainability throughout our organization. Through the efforts of the Sustainability Team and others throughout our organization, we have improved the packaging for some of our hardware by switching to recyclable materials and eliminating polyethylene bags from our user guides. We are also actively working towards replacing many of our paper manuals with online guides.
Social
We are committed to providing an equal opportunity for all employees regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or other differences. We want every employee to feel valued, respected and heard. We believe that recruiting from the widest available talent pool, and then facilitating collaboration among people of all experiences and backgrounds enhances our ability to innovate. In order to further support our talent development efforts, we identified Diversity Ambassadors to foster communication regarding diversity and inclusion initiatives, and to drive initiatives and trainings that improve our overall team performance via better collaboration while also increasing understanding amongst our diverse cultures. We continue to promote our Women in Tech group, aimed to empower women to grow their technical expertise and leadership in science, engineering and technology at Alarm.com. We also developed and launched an Apprenticeship Program to help break down traditional barriers to entry into the technology industry that provides hands on training that can be applied in the real world.
We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to navigate remote work and the stresses of the pandemic, it is important that we support the mental health of our employees. In 2021, we partnered with a company that helps support mental health in the workplace through trainings and information sessions. We also provide additional healthcare benefits to employees, making it safer and more convenient to get the care they need remotely. In addition to primary care, these additional remote healthcare benefits include physical therapy, mental health services and health coaching. In 2021, we also provided free access to an app that promotes wellness through meditation and provides employees with hundreds of guided exercises for meditation, sleep, focus and movement. We also partnered with a company that provides various family care benefits, including access to a self-service, searchable database of providers for family care needs, including care for children, adult dependents, pets and tutoring.
Governance
Our corporate behavior and leadership practices are based on integrity and ethical decision-making. Employees are informed about our governance expectations through our Code of Business Conduct, compliance training programs and ongoing communications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our corporate governance objectives, strategies, goals, compliance and risk mitigation.
Our Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,500 full-time employees, including 476 in sales and marketing, 837 in research and development and 187 in a general and administrative capacity. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,363 employees in our Alarm.com segment and 137 employees in our Other segment. We also engage consultants and temporary employees from time to time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is critical to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our service provider partners and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives and offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices.
To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer a wide range of programs and avenues for support, motivation, and professional recognition. We utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to provide custom training courses to ensure our sales and services teams stay up-to-date on our products and service offerings. For our talent pipeline development, we work closely with individual departments to provide training and hands-on support for managers and leaders, to assess talent, identify development opportunities and discuss succession planning. In addition, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
Government Regulations
Our business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation and other laws and regulations, and to similar laws and regulations in the other countries in which we operate. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
