  ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
 We are a biotechnology acceleration and development company focused on acquiring and in-licensing pre-clinical, clinical-stage and approved life sciences therapeutic products. Currently, we have a portfolio of four therapeutic products, including an FDA approved product, Strontium 89, a radiopharmaceutical for metastatic cancer bone pain, and three development stage products: QBM-001 for rare pediatric non-verbal autism spectrum disorder, Uttroside-B for liver cancer, and MAN 01 for glaucoma. We aim to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on multiple assets throughout the discovery and development cycle. We expect to benefit from early positioning in illiquid and/or less well known privately-held assets, thereby enabling us to capitalize on valuation growth as these assets move forward in their development.
  
 Our mission is to:
  
 
(i) | license and acquire pre-commercial innovative life sciences assets in different stages of development and therapeutic areas from academia or small private companies;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | license and acquire FDA approved drugs and medical devices with limited current and commercial activity; and
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | accelerate and advance our assets to the next value inflection point by providing: strategic capital, business development and financial advice and experienced sector specific advisors.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 In 2018, we plan: (i) to generate revenue from our Strontium 89 product for pain palliation in bone metastases as well as commence a therapeutic expansion post-marketing phase 4 trial for this product; and (ii) to commence a phase 2/3 pivotal trial with our QBM-001 asset to address a non-verbal learning disorder in autistic children. In 2019, we intend to file investigational new drug applications, or INDs, with the FDA for each of our Uttroside-B and MAN 01 assets for the treatment of liver cancer and glaucoma, respectively.
  
 Following is a summary of our product pipeline.
  
  Our Strategy
  
 Our goal is to become a leading biotechnology acceleration and development company with a diversified portfolio of therapeutic products commercially available and in development. To achieve this goal, we are executing on the following strategy:

● | Strategically collaborate or in- and out-license select programs. We seek to collaborate or in- and out-license certain potentially therapeutic candidate products to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly leverage external talent and resources. We plan to maintain and further build our team which is skilled in evaluating technologies for development and product development towards commercialization. By partnering with industry specific experts, we are able to identify undervalued assets that we can fund and assist in enhancing inherent value. We plan to continue to rely on the extensive experience of our management team to execute on our objectives. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evaluate commercialization and monetization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products. As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate’s commercialization or monetization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing any product that we develop by ourselves or jointly with another party, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets such product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is too early for us to know which of these options we will pursue for our drug candidates, assuming their successful development.

● | Acquire commercially or near-commercially ready products and build out the current market for such. In addition to acquiring pre-clinical products, in assembling a diversified portfolio of healthcare assets, we plan on acquiring assets that are either FDA approved or are reasonably expected to be FDA approved within 12 months of our acquiring them. We anticipate hiring a contract sales organization to assume the bulk of the sales and distribution efforts related to any such product.

  General Information
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 22, 2013 under the name ISMO Technology Solutions and attempted to establish a base of operation in the information technology sector and provide IT hardware, software and support solutions to businesses and households. However, we did not pursue our business plan to any great extent due to the deteriorating health of the major shareholder and CEO, Mr. Enrique Navas.
  
 On August 5, 2015, we recorded a stock split effectuated in the form a stock dividend. The stock dividend was paid at a rate of 1.5 “new” shares for every one issued and outstanding share held. All common share amounts and per share amounts as referred throughout this prospectus have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.
  
 On April 21, 2015, we issued 2,500,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Denis Corin pursuant to a consulting agreement and Mr. Corin also agreed to join the Board of Directors. On July 15, 2016, we issued to Mr. Corin five-year warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.45 per share.
  
 On June 1, 2015, our shareholders elected Mr. William Rosenstadt to the Board of Directors and appointed him as Chief Legal Officer.  In exchange for such services for a one-year term, we agreed to pay Mr. Rosenstadt 375,000 shares of our common stock. We engaged the law firm at which Mr. Rosenstadt is a partner to provide us with legal services. We have paid for these services through the issuance to such law firm of 500,000 shares of our common stock on June 1, 2015, five-year warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at a price of $4.15 per share on January 15, 2016 and five-year warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.45 per share on July 16, 2016. On July 15, 2016, we issued Mr. Rosenstadt five-year warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.45 per share for his services as a director.
  
 Also on June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors determined it was in the best interest of the Company to establish a base of operations in the biomedical industry. As a result, the Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s name from “ISMO Tech Solutions, Inc.” to “Q BioMed Inc.”  Q BioMed Inc. established its business as a biomedical acceleration and development company focused on licensing, acquiring and providing strategic resources to life sciences and healthcare companies.
  
 On July 23, 2015, our founder and CEO, Mr. Enrique Navas, resigned from his position a director of our company and any positions that he held as an officer of the Company. This resignation did not result from any dispute or disagreement with us, our independent accountants, our counsel or our operations, policies and practices. Mr. Navas agreed to return 3,750,000 shares of common stock owned by him to the treasury.
  
 On October 27, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue from 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares. The Certificate of Amendment affected no provisions of our Articles of Incorporation other than the number of common stock that we are authorized to issue, and we are still authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
  
  Our Drug Discovery Approach
  
 We aim to acquire or license and have assembled a pipeline of multiple therapeutics in development stages ranging from early pre-clinical to commercial ready. Our model seeks to diversify risk by broadening the therapeutic areas we work in as well as providing multiple catalysts as we advance assets through the clinical and regulatory process.
  
 Our mission is to:
  
 
(i) | license and acquire pre-commercial innovative life sciences assets in different stages of development and therapeutic areas from academia or small private companies;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | license and acquire FDA approved drugs and medical devices with limited current and commercial activity;
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | accelerate and advance our assets to the next value inflection point by providing: (A) strategic capital, (B) business development and financial advice and (C) experienced sector specific advisors.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Research and Development Activities
  
  In the fiscal years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred approximately $3.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on research and development activities, including the issuance of 125,000 and 50,000 shares of common stock issued to Asdera LLC (“Asdera”) and Bio-Nucleonics Inc. (“BNI”) in the corresponding year, valued at approximately $488,000 and $160,000, respectively.
 Mannin Intellectual Property
  
 On October 29, 2015, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement with Mannin whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive license on, and option to acquire, certain Mannin intellectual property, or IP, within the four-year term.
  
 The Mannin IP is initially focused on developing a first-in-class eye drop treatment for glaucoma. The technology platform may be expanded in scope beyond ophthalmological uses and may include cystic kidney disease and others. The initial cost to acquire the exclusive license from Mannin was $50,000 and the issuance of 200,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $548,000, subject to an 18-month restriction from trading and subsequent leak-out conditions. Upon Mannin completing a successful phase 1 proof of concept trial in glaucoma, we will be obligated to issue an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mannin, also subject to leak-out conditions. We believe this milestone could occur in the first half of 2019.
  
 5
  
   

  
 
 
 Pursuant to the exclusive license from Mannin, we may purchase the Mannin IP within the next four years in exchange for: (i) investing a minimum of $4,000,000 into the development of the Mannin IP and (ii) possibly issuing Mannin additional shares of our common stock based on meeting pre-determined valuation and market conditions. During the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, we incurred approximately $1.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in research and development expenses to fund the costs of development of the eye drop treatment for glaucoma pursuant to the Exclusive License, of which an aggregate of $2.0 million and $0.7 million was already paid as of November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Through November 30, 2017, we have funded an aggregate of $2.7 million to Mannin under the Exclusive License.
  
 In the event that: (i) we do not exercise the option to purchase the Mannin IP; (ii) we fail to invest the $4,000,000 within four years from the date of the exclusive license; or (iii) we fail to make a diligent, good faith and commercially reasonable effort to progress the Mannin IP, all Mannin IP shall revert back to Mannin and we shall be granted the right to collect twice the monies invested through that date of reversion by way of a royalty along with other consideration which may be perpetual.
  
  MAN 01 – New Vascular Therapeutics including Primary Open Angle Glaucoma
  
 Mannin is utilizing a proprietary research platform technology to address the need for a new class of drugs to treat various vascular diseases. Our lead indication is for a first-in-class therapeutic eye-drop for the treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma.
  
 We are developing a first-in-class drug targeting the Schlemm's canal and its role in regulating interocular eye pressure, one of the leading causes of glaucoma. No other glaucoma company is targeting the Schlemm's canal, the main drainage pathway in the eye. This unique vessel is responsible for 70-90% of the fluid drainage in the eye. The MAN 01 drug is currently in the lead optimization stage of its pre-clinical testing. We aim to initiate IND enabling studies is 2018 and file an IND in 2019.
  
 We believe that a deep pipeline of novel therapeutics can be developed from this research platform, which would treat a spectrum of vascular diseases including Cystic Kidney Disease, Pediatric Glaucoma and Inflammation.
  
 Recently, a number of significant deals and announcements have been made in the ophthalmology space. Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced successful efficacy data from its first phase III registration study, Mercury 1, on Roclatan. Roclatan (once daily) is being evaluated for its ability of lowering intraocular pressure, or IOP, in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The success of this Aerie trial is an indication of the importance of this market, and the acute need for novel drugs to treat the over 60 million sufferers of this disease. In addition, in October 2015, Allergan plc, a leading global pharmaceutical company, acquired AqueSys, Inc. a private clinical stage medical device company focused on developing ocular implants that reduce IOP associated with glaucoma, in an all-cash transaction for a $300 million upfront payment and regulatory approval and commercialization milestone payments related to AqueSys' lead development programs.
  
  BioNucleonics Intellectual Property
  
 On May 30, 2016, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement with BNI, which agreement was amended on September 6, 2016, whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive license on certain BNI intellectual property and the option to acquire the BNI IP within three years of the BNI.
  
 The BNI IP consists of generic Strontium Chloride SR89 (Generic Metastron®) and all of BNI’s intellectual property relating to it. Currently, SR89 is a radiopharmaceutical therapeutic for cancer bone pain therapy. We plan on exploring options to broaden the technology platform in scope to uses beyond metastatic cancer bone pain. In exchange for the consideration, we agreed, upon reaching various milestones, to issue to BNI an aggregate of 110,000 shares of common stock that are subject to restriction from trading until commercialization of the product (which we anticipate will occur in Spring 2018) and subsequent leak-out conditions, and provide funding to BNI for an aggregate of $850,000 in cash, of which we had paid $466,000 as of November 30, 2017. Once we have funded up to $850,000 in cash, we may exercise the option to acquire the BNI IP at no additional charge.  In September 2016, we issued 50,000 shares of common stock, with a fair value of $160,500, to BNI pursuant to the exclusive license from BNI.
  
 In the event that: (i) we do not exercise the option to purchase the BNI IP; (ii) we fail to invest the $850,000 within three years from the date of the exclusive license; or (iii) we fail to make a diligent, good faith and commercially reasonable effort to progress the BNI IP, all BNI IP shall revert back to BNI and we shall be granted the right to collect twenty percent of the monies invested through that date of reversion by way of a royalty until such time that the aggregate of royalties paid exceeds twice the aggregate of all total cash investment paid by Q Bio along with other consideration which may be perpetual.
  
  Generic Strontium89 Chloride SR89 Injection USP
  
 Strontium89 is an FDA approved drug for pain palliation in bone metastases, primarily from breast, prostate and lung cancers. It is Medicare and Healthcare insurance reimbursable. Strontium-89 is a pure beta emitting radiopharmaceutical. It is a chemical analog of calcium and for this reason, localizes in bone. There is a significant concentration of both calcium and strontium analogs at the site of active osteoblastic activity. This is the biochemical basis for its use in treating metastatic bone disease.
  
 Strontium 89 shows prolonged retention in metastatic bone lesions with a biological half-life of over 50 days, remaining up to 100 days after injection of the radiopharmaceutical, whereas the half-life in normal bone tissue is approximately 14 days. Strontium-89 has been shown to decrease pain in patients with osteoblastic metastases resulting from prostate cancer. When Strontium-89 Chloride is used, pain palliation occurs in up to 80% of patients within 2 to 3 weeks after administration and lasts from 3 to 12 months with an average of about 6 months.

 In the United States, of the estimated 450,000 individuals newly diagnosed with either breast or prostate cancer, one in three will develop bone metastases, a common cause of pain in cancer patients. These figures are expected to increase as the potential patient population ages.
  
 Strontium 89 is a non-opioid drug for the treatment of debilitating metastatic cancer pain in the bone. We believe there is a significant opportunity to market this effective drug as practitioners and caregivers are being encouraged to reexamine their use of opiates for treating patients in pain. We estimate the palliation market to be approximately $300 million annually. Additional therapeutic indications for Strontium 89 are possible, and we intend to pursue those in 2018, hopefully resulting in entry into a multi-billion dollar therapeutic area.
  
  ASDERA Intellectual Property
  
 On April 21, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement on Patent & Know-How Technology with ASDERA whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive, license on certain ASDERA intellectual property.
  
 Among the more than 60,000 US children who develop autism spectrum disorders, or ASD, every year, approximately 20,000 become nonverbal and will have to rely on assisted living for the rest of their lives. The ASDERA IP is intended to treat the rare pediatric condition (nonverbal disorder) during the second year of life, when children learn to speak. Many of the children who miss this treatment window will become non-verbal for all of their lives. Currently, there is no treatment for this nonverbal disorder. The ASDERA IP is not intended to treat other aspects of ASD or to be used beyond the estimated treatment window. The ASDERA IP consists of patent-rights and know-how relating to a product candidate named ASD-002 (now identified as QBM001).
  
 The initial cost to acquire the exclusive license from ASDERA was $50,000 and the issuance of 125,000 shares of our unregistered common stock subject to a leak-out conditions after the Rule 144 period has ended. In addition to royalties based upon net sales of the product candidate, if any, we are required to make additional payments upon the following milestones:
  
 
● | the filing of an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the US Food and Drug Administration;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successful interim results of Phase II/III clinical trial of the product candidate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA acceptance of a new drug application;
--+------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of the product candidate; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | achieving certain worldwide net sales.
--+---------------------------------------


 
 Subject to the terms of the Agreement, we will be in control of the development and commercialization of the product candidate and are responsible for the costs of such development and commercialization.  We have undertaken a good-faith commitment to (i) initiate a Phase II/III clinical trial at the earlier of the two-year anniversary of the Agreement or one year from the FDA’s approval of the IND and (ii) to make our first commercial sale by the fifth-anniversary of the Agreement.  Failure to show a good-faith effort to meet those goals would mean that the ASDERA IP would revert to ASDERA.  Upon such reversion, ASDERA would be obligated to pay us royalties on any sales of products derived from the ASDERA IP until such time that ASDERA has paid us twice the sum that we had provided ASDERA prior to the reversion.
  
  QBM-001 - Addressing Rare Pediatric Non-verbal Spectrum Disorder
  
 Causes of non-verbal learning disorder have been linked to several complications that range from a specific mutated gene as with Fragile X Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome or autoimmunity, where the body’s immune system is attacking parts of the brain. Trauma, microbial infections and environmental factors have also been linked to non-verbal learning disorder. Ongoing research is helping to further explain the root cause of why children become non-verbal or minimally verbal.
  
 Children born into families where there is a genetic history of autism or epileptic spectrum disorders or that have a sibling that has been diagnosed with an autistic or epileptic spectrum disorder have a much higher chance of becoming non-verbal.
  
 More than 60,000 US children develop Autism Spectrum Disorders (“ASD”) every year, of whom 20,000 become non-verbal. A similar number of children with ASD symptoms in Europe develop pediatric non-verbal disorder each year. No drugs are currently available to ameliorate this condition. In the United States, of the estimated 20,000 who become non- or minimally verbal and will require assisted living for the rest of their life. The lifetime cost of that care is estimated at $10 million per person.
  
 Cognitive intervention is the only form for treatment that has shown to help improve speech capability and social interaction, however, it has not been able to alleviate the lifetime burden of $10 million per person for cost of care. This is compounded by an additional $10 million during the lifespan of the person due to loss in productivity in addition to severe emotional strain for the child and the parents.
  
 QBM-001 is proposed to be given to high-risk genetically identified children during the second year of life to regulate faulty membrane channels that are known to cause migraines and/or seizures. This drug acts as an allosteric regulator of these faulty channels in the brain to potentially alleviate the condition and allow toddlers to actively develop language and speech and avoid life-long speech and intellectual disability of being non-verbal
  
 As there are no treatment option for these patients, we believe there is a significant economic opportunity to bring a drug to market in this indication. The active ingredient in our compound is well known and has been approved by worldwide regulators for many years. Using a novel delivery and formulation for the active ingredient, we intend to advance this drug through the 505(b)2 pathway in a single phase 2/3 clinical trial expected to commence in 2018.

  RGCB and OMRF Intellectual Property
  
 On June 15, 2017, we entered into a Technology License Agreement RGCB and OMRF whereby they granted us a worldwide, exclusive, license on intellectual property related to Uttroside-B.  Uttroside-B is a chemical compound derived from the plant Solanum nigrum Linn, also known as Black Nightshade or Makoi.  We seek to use the Uttroside-B IP to create a chemotherapeutic agent against liver cancer.
  
 The initial cost to acquire the exclusive license for Uttroside is $10,000. In addition to royalties based upon net sales of the product candidate, if any, we are required to make additional payments upon the following milestones:
  
 
● | the completion of certain preclinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | the filing of an investigational new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration or the filing of the equivalent application with an equivalent governmental agency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successful completion of each of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of the product candidate;
--+---------------------------------------


● | approval by the foreign equivalent of the FDA of the product candidate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieving certain worldwide net sales; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | a change of control of our Company.
--+------------------------------------


 
 Subject to the terms of the exclusive license for Uttroside, we will be in control of the development and commercialization of the product candidate and are responsible for the costs of such development and commercialization.  We have undertaken a good-faith commitment to (i) fund the pre-clinical trials and (ii) to initiate a Phase II clinical trial within six years of the date of the Agreement.  Failure to show a good-faith effort to meet those goals would mean that the exclusive license for Uttroside would revert to the licensors.
  
  UTTROSIDE-B - A Novel Chemotherapeutic for Liver Cancer
  
 The liver is the football-sized organ in the upper right area of the belly. Symptoms of liver cancer are uncommon in the early stages. Liver cancer treatments vary, but may include removal of part of the liver, liver transplant, chemotherapy, and in some cases radiation. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by birth defects, alcohol abuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis. In the United States, the average age at onset of liver cancer is 63 years. Men are more likely to develop liver cancer than women, by a ratio of 2 to 1.
  
 The only currently marketed drug is a tryosine kinase inhibitor antineoplastic agent, sorafinib. Current sales of sorafinib are estimated at $1 billion per year.
  
 Uttroside-B appears to affect phosphorylated JNK (pro survival signaling) and capcase activity (apoptosis in liver cancer). It is a natural compound fractionated Saponin derived from the Solarim Nigrum plant. It is a small molecule that showed in early investigation to increase the cytotoxicity of a variety of liver cancer cell types and importantly to be up to ten times more potent than Sorafenib in pre-clinical studies. This potency motivates us to work with our partners to synthesize the molecule and move into a clinical program. We plan to initiate clinical work in late 2018.
  
  Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
  
 If products we acquired do not have adequate intellectual protection, we will take the necessary steps to protect our proprietary therapeutic product candidate assets and associated technologies that are important to our business consisting of seeking and maintaining domestic and international patents. These may cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. Our competitive position depends on our ability to obtain patents on our technologies and our potential products, to defend our patents, to protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets of others. We seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position.
  
 We hold a license to all intellectual property related to each of (i) MAN 01, the drug candidate for the treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, (ii) ASD-002 (QBM001), the drug candidate related to a nonverbal disorder associated with autism, (iii) SR89, our generic Strontium 89 Chloride product candidate for metastatic cancer bone pain therapy, and (iv) the Uttroside platform.
  
 We do not hold, and have not applied for, any patents in our own right. All patents are held in the licensors or inventors names and are assignable under license agreements to Q BioMed Inc..

  Competition
  
 We operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in the fields in which we research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.
  
 Our generic SR89 product candidate will compete directly with Metastron® which is produced by a subsidiary of General Electric Company, a company with a market capitalization of over $150 billion. Metastron is currently the sole SR89 product for the treatment of cancer related bone pain, and we may not be able to penetrate this market sufficiently. General Electric Company may choose to significantly reduce the cost of Metastron, and we may face further price competition if other companies choose to produce a generic SR89 product. Such price competition may cause us to reduce our price and in turn, decrease any revenues we may generate.
  
  Government Regulation
  
 The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive approval of a BLA from the FDA. The process of obtaining BLA approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these products depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities (or those of third parties upon which we rely) are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.
  
 The FDA or another regulatory agency can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:
  
 
● | the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication; 
● | the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States; 
● | the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval; 
● | we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; 
● | the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 
● | the FDA may fail to approve our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or
● | the approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval. 


 
 With respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.
  
  Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
  
 Federal, state, and international environmental laws may impose certain costs and restrictions on our business. We do not believe that we have yet spent or lost money due to these laws and regulations.
 Product Liability and Insurance
  
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and the eventual sale and use of any product candidates, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. We currently do not maintain product liability insurance.
