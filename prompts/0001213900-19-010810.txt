Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on April 7, 2016 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to in this report as the initial business combination. While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we have initially focused our search on identifying a prospective target business in the wireless telecommunications industry in the United States, as described below. As previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 1, 2019, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Agreement”) on January 31, 2019 with U.S. TelePacific Holdings Corp., d/b/a TPx Communications (“TPx”) and Tango Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, relating to the proposed business combination between the Company and TPx. On May 20, 2019, we mutually agreed with TPx to terminate the Agreement pursuant to a Termination of Business Combination Agreement dated as of May 20, 2019, effective as of such date. As a result of the termination of the Agreement, effective as of May 20, 2019, the Agreement is of no further force or effect, and no party to the Agreement shall have any liability under the Agreement except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Agreement. We intend to continue to pursue a business combination.
 
On January 28, 2019, at the Special Meeting in lieu of the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Company’s Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination for an additional three months, from February 1, 2019 to May 1, 2019. The amendment was approved with 26,352,896 votes cast in favor of the amendment, 122,986 votes cast against the amendment and 323,175 abstentions. In connection with the special meeting and the resulting amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, 2,796,290 shares of our common stock were redeemed from funds available in the trust account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Trust Account”), for a redemption amount of approximately $10.18 per share.
 
On April 22, 2019, we announced that our sponsor, had agreed to contribute to us as a loan $0.033 for each share of our common stock issued in our initial public offering that was not redeemed in connection with the stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination for an additional three months, from May 1, 2019 to August 1, 2019. On April 29, 2019, at the Special Meeting of the Company’s Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination for an additional three months, from May 1, 2019 to August 1, 2019. The amendment was approved with 26,163,835 votes cast in favor of the amendment, 2,020,001 votes cast against the amendment and 422,075 abstentions. In connection with the special meeting and the resulting amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, 3,831,985 shares of our common stock were redeemed from funds available in the Trust Account, for a redemption amount of approximately $10.33 per share.
 
On May 31, 2019, we announced that our sponsor will reduce its contributions to the Trust Account. Our sponsor will continue to pay to the Trust Account $0.033 per public share that has not been redeemed per month, but the total monthly payment will be no greater than $200,000. If more than 6,060,606 public shares remain outstanding after redemptions in connection with this adjustment, then the amount paid per share will be reduced proportionately. In connection with this announcement, we offered our public stockholders the right to redeem their shares of our common stock for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. Our stockholders have until 5:00 p.m., eastern time, on June 14, 2019 to elect to redeem their public shares.
 
We expect that the wireless telecommunications industry will experience significant growth in coming years. Global mobile data traffic increased by 63% in 2016, and is projected to continue to increase by similar rates for the coming five years, according to the Cisco Visual Networking Index Forecast. Demands on the total wireless network are expected to reach 1,000 times existing capacity levels. In fiscal 2017, the total capital expenditure by the four largest carriers (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile) is expected to be approximately $50 billion. We believe that these large telecommunications operators are increasingly focusing on the extreme ends of the industry value chain, in particular the production, ownership, licensing and distribution of content and the acquisition, retention and exploitation of end-user subscribers, as evidenced by high-profile public transactions such as the acquisitions by AT&T of Time Warner and DirecTV for $85.4 billion and $48.5 billion, respectively. Additionally, AT&T has divested itself of its wireless tower portfolio in an approximately $4.85 billion sale to Crown Castle, while simultaneously entering into lease contacts with terms reaching to 2032 through 2048. We believe that this trend of increasing externalization of infrastructure-related assets and services, allowing the operators to focus on content and subscriber products and services, creates significant opportunities for third-party providers, and we intend to focus on acquisition opportunities among such providers of infrastructure-related assets and services.

We seek to capitalize on the significant investing and operating experience and contacts of our officers and directors in consummating an initial business combination. Our Chief Executive Officer, Darrell J. Mays, has over 30 years’ experience in the wireless telecommunications industry and our President, Dr. Robert Willis, Chairman of the Board, Lawrence E. Mock, Jr., independent directors Bert Ellis, Suzanne Shank and Karl Krapek and special advisors Rayford Wilkins, Jr., Dr. David Panton and Michael Pietropola, have significant experience in private investments, ownership and management of businesses of many types, large and small. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector and in any region, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background so we can capitalize on their ability to identify, acquire and operate a business. We therefore intend to initially focus on companies in the wireless telecommunications industry; however, we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that is not connected to the wireless telecommunications industry.
 
We believe our sponsor’s and management team’s deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise, as well as their network of contacts will position us to take advantage of opportunities in the wireless telecommunications industry. We believe this expertise and network of contacts will allow us to generate a number of acquisition opportunities. As a result of their investing and operating expertise, we believe there are a number of high-quality wireless telecommunications businesses with adequate scale to be attractive public companies.
 

● | We intend to seek out potential targets that enjoy proven business models and attractive growth profiles. We also believe our sponsor’s and management team’s extensive experience in deal sourcing from private and public sources, as well as their advisory and consulting engagements, provide unique insight when identifying potential business combination opportunities and creating value. We believe their experience and proximity to real-time information positions us to obtain access to differentiated deal flow, frequently in a non-competitive manner and prior to other parties with an interest in such transactions.

The registration statements for the Company’s initial public offering were declared effective on July 27, 2017. On August 1, 2017, the Company consummated the initial public offering of 27,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $270,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company consummated the sale of private warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement to the sponsor, MasTec and EBC, generating gross proceeds of $9,500,000 (the “private placement”).
 
Following the closing of the initial public offering on August 1, 2017, an amount of $270,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the private warrants was placed in the Trust Account and will be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below, except that interest earned on the Trust Account can be released to pay the Company’s income tax obligations.
 
On August 4, 2017, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full resulting in an additional 4,050,000 units being issued for $40,500,000, less the underwriters’ discount of $1,012,500, netting $39,487,500 which was deposited into the Trust Account. In connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company also consummated the sale of an additional 1,012,500 private warrants at $1.00 per warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $1,012,500 less the advance payment on August 1, 2017 of $600,000 towards that transaction resulting in an additional $412,500 being deposited into the Trust Account and bringing the balance in the Trust Account on August 4, 2017 to $310,500,000.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $8,646,303, consisting of $7,762,500 of underwriting fees, and $883,803 of other costs. In addition, as of March 31, 2019, $135,265 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account, which is available for working capital purposes.

Competitive Strengths
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.
 
We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 

● | have strong competitive positions, proven business models, consistent historical financial performance and attractive growth prospects;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have limited access to capital markets due to external factors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | could benefit from the substantial expertise, experience and network of our sponsor and management team, who could assist with, for example, growth strategy, international expansion, operations and the evaluation and integration of acquisitions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are well positioned to participate in sector consolidation and would benefit from a public acquisition currency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | would avoid the potentially onerous terms, such as liquidation preferences, that are often characteristic of late state private growth financing rounds; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.
--+----------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We have until August 1, 2019 to consummate an initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.00 per share of common stock, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.

We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.
 
MasTec has indicated that if, at the time we identify a potential target for a business combination, the transaction requires a commitment of capital, it will, if requested, consider providing such a commitment. The execution of any binding agreement to provide such additional financing would be in MasTec’s sole discretion at the time and would be subject to the transaction meeting its investment criteria and the completion of customary due diligence and documentation. Accordingly, there is no assurance that MasTec will ultimately agree to provide such additional financing.
 
Employees
 
We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We currently have one part-time employee, and we do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock, rights and warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. These filings are available to the public via the Internet at the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. For more information, please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may request a copy of our filings with the SEC (excluding exhibits) at no cost by writing or telephoning us at the following address or telephone number:
Pensare Acquisition Corp.
 1720 Peachtree Street
 Suite 629
 Atlanta, GA 30309
 Tel: (404) 234-3098
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the international accounting standards board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion or our total annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
