ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Rebel Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, organizes, promotes and hosts mixed martial arts (“MMA”) events featuring MMA talents. It delivers MMA events centered on Chinese fighters and martial art fans. With assistance from contracted production crews, the Company produces and distributes videos of its MMA events through the Internet and social media. It also generates revenues from the exploitation of its film television rights.
 
Our operations focus on three business components:
 

● | Live MMA event promotion, which consists of generating revenue from ticket sales and providing a foundation for sponsorship and distribution for our live MMA events in China. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MMA content distribution, which consists of paid distribution of original content on television, cable networks, pay-per-view broadcasts, and over the Internet, in China and through international distribution agreements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sponsorships and promotions, which consist of sponsorships for live MMA events and televised productions and related advertising and promotional opportunities. 

 
The Company seeks to promote MMA in China by hosting live high-profile matches that features talented fighters from around the world. MMA is a full contact sport that permits fighters to use techniques from various martial art disciplines such as Boxing, Wrestling, Taekwondo, Karate, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and Judo. Unlike boxing, where athletes can only strike with their fists and target areas above the belt, the fighters in MMA can use punches, kicks, elbows, knee strikes, takedowns and submissions to win a contest.
 
Producing MMA events include various business operations such as securing event venues, signing up fighters and performers, obtaining sponsorships, producing event videos, marketing, and hosting pre-event shows which consist of music performances, fighters’ interviews and documentaries. The Company’s events are broadcast through top sporting entertainment stations such as Guangdong TV sports channel, Beijing TV Sports Channel and Qinghai satellite. We also utilize major Chinese internet platforms such as PP Sports, YY.com and Youku (Alisports) for online streaming in order to reach more audiences.
 
The Company has successfully hosted eight MMA events. The most recent MMA event was held in May 2018, with its total online digital viewership exceeding eight million and total broadcast TV viewership reaching approximately five million according to CSM Media Research, a China-based media ratings research company.
 
Our Events
 
The Company hosts live events in which highly skilled fighters from different martial arts backgrounds compete at different weight classes. We introduce fighters’ background information and training stories into the broadcasting of fighting events.
 
The Company selects fighters with track records of distinguished careers. After a careful selection process assessing each fighters’ amateur and professional records, age, experience and fame, we market our MMA events through social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Chinese Weibo and WeChat, TV channels such as Guangdong TV sports channel, Beijing TV Sports Channel and Qinghai Satellite TV, as well as video and interviews covered by major Chinese media outlets such as Guangzhou TV news channel, Guangzhou Daily and Pudong TV.
 
We held two MMA events in 2018. The first event in 2018 was held on April 29, 2018 at Kerry Hotel in Shanghai. The event was broadcast live by major Chinese TV channels such as Guangdong Sports TV, Tianjin Sports TV, Fujian TV, Beijing TV Sports and Shenzhen TV and major digital platforms such as Weibo and Youku. The viewership for the first event were 4.06 million from television and 8.33 million from digital platforms. The second event took place at Tianhe Stadium in Guangzhou on May 30, 2018. The event was broadcast live by major Chinese TV channels such as Guangdong Sports TV, Tianjin Sports, Qinghai Satellite TV and major digital platforms such as Youku, PP Sports and YY.com. The viewership for the second event were 4.99 million from television and 8.15 million from digital platforms.
 
Corporate History and Background 
 
Rebel Group, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 13, 2011. Effective April 16, 2013, the Company changed its name from “First Social Networx Corp.” to “Moxian Group Holdings, Inc.” with “MOXG” as its trading symbol. Also, effective April 16, 2013, the Company increased the number of shares that it is authorized to issue to a total of 600,000,000 shares, including 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. In addition, effective April 16, 2013, the Company effected a 20-for-1 forward stock split of its Common Stock, without changing the par value or the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock (the “Forward Split”).

On April 25, 2013, pursuant to a share exchange agreement, the Company completed a reverse acquisition of Moxian Group Limited (“Moxian BVI”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Moxian (Hong Kong) Limited (“Moxian HK”), Moxian Technologies (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“Moxian Shenzhen”) and Moxian Malaysia SDN BHD (“Moxian Malaysia”) (the “Share Exchange Transaction”). The Company acquired the operating business of Moxian BVI and its subsidiaries and the Company ceased being a shell company as such term is defined under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. After the incorporation of the business of Moxian BVI, the Company changed its business to developing a social network platform that sought to integrate social media and business into one single platform.
 
On February 17, 2014, the Company incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Moxian Intellectual Property Limited, under the laws of Samoa (“Moxian IP”). On February 19, 2014, Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with Moxian IP, where Moxian HK and Moxian Shenzhen assigned and transferred all of the intellectual property rights that they respectively owned in connection with the Moxian business (the “IP Rights”) to Moxian IP in consideration of $1,000,000. As a result, the Company then owned and controlled such IP Rights through Moxian IP.
 
On February 19, 2014, the shareholders then holding a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company approved and authorized the Company to enter into a License and Acquisition Agreement (the “License and Acquisition Agreement”) with MOXC, pursuant to which the Company sold 100% of the equity interests of Moxian BVI together with its subsidiaries to Moxian CN Group Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MOXC (“Moxian CN Samoa”) for $1,000,000. The License and Acquisition Agreement closed on February 21, 2014. As a result, Moxian BVI, together with its subsidiaries, Moxian HK, Moxian Shenzhen, and Moxian Malaysia, became the subsidiaries of MOXC.
 
Under the License and Acquisition Agreement, the Company also agreed to grant MOXC the exclusive right to use the Company’s then held IP Rights in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and other countries and regions where the Company conduct business (the “Licensed Territory”) as well as the exclusive right to solicit, promote, distribute and sell Moxian products and services in the Licensed Territory for five years (the “License”). In exchange for such license, MOXC agreed to pay to the Company: (i) $1,000,000 as a license maintenance royalty each year commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the License and Acquisition Agreement and (ii) 3% of the gross profit resulting from distribution and sale of our products and services on behalf of the Company as an earned royalty. In addition, MOXC had the right to acquire the new IP Rights that are developed by the Company and sub-license such rights to a third party. MOXC was also under the obligation to develop the social media market of our products and services in the Licensed Territory. Immediately prior to the execution of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Moxian BVI Transfer Price was not paid and no license maintenance royalty or earned royalty under the License and Acquisition Agreement had accrued.
 
Therefore, under the Equity Transfer Agreement, discussed below, the Company and MOXC agreed to terminate the License and Acquisition Agreement so that the liabilities of MOXC and the rights of the Company thereunder, other than the Moxian BVI Transfer Price, were terminated.
 
The Company sought to acquire a new business in the technology area and as a result, on July 23, 2014, the Company changed its name from “Moxian Group Holdings, Inc.” to “Inception Technology Group, Inc.” Also, effective July 23, 2014, the Company effected a 1-for-5 reverse split of its issued and outstanding Common Stock. However, no acquisition of a technology business was closed or consummated.
 
On December 5, 2014, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name from “Inception Technology Group, Inc.” to “Rebel Group, Inc.” and effectuated a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock, without changing the par value or the number of authorized shares of the Common Stock (the “Reverse Split”). The business plan of the Company was originally to utilize a social network platform that integrated social media and business into one single platform to promote businesses of merchants and assist the targeted clients to find consumers online and bring them into real-world stores.

On January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and submitted for approval of the Company’s shareholders with a majority of voting rights, a Plan of Disposition (“Plan of Disposition”). Under the Plan of Disposition, the Company proposed to distribute the proceeds resulting from the Equity Transfer Transaction and Sale of Moxian BVI, within one year from the date of the Equity Transfer Transaction, to the shareholders as of January 29, 2015, on a pro-rata basis except for Rebel FC Stockholder, who agreed to waive such proceeds. On January 30, 2015, the Company’s shareholders with a majority of voting rights approved the Plan of Disposition. No additional vote of the Company’s shareholders was required or sought in connection with the Plan of Disposition, and the Company’s record shareholders had no appraisal rights in connection with the proposed transactions under the Plan of Disposition. The Plan of Disposition was not completed within the planned one year period, and was delayed due to MOXC’s then proposed underwritten offering and exchange listing. On May 24, 2016, due to the MOXC Reverse Stock Split, effective on June 20, 2016, the Company’s shares in MOXC were reduced from 7,782,000 shares to 3,891,000 shares. The Company is in the process of preparing and approving a revised Plan of Disposition, which takes into account that the Company currently holds 3,891,000 shares of MOXC which are currently valued at $11,634,090 and pursuant to which the Company plans to distribute, as a dividend, the 3,891,000 MOXC shares to the Company’s shareholders as of January 29, 2015, on a pro-rata basis, that would have been entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale of the MOXC shares by the Company under the original Plan of Disposition, if the Company had consummated such sale.
 
Also on January 30, 2015, REBL, Rebel FC and the sole stockholder of Rebel FC (the “Rebel FC Stockholder”) entered into and consummated transactions pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement,” such transaction referred to as the “Share Exchange Transaction”), whereby the Company issued to the Rebel FC Stockholder 20,700,000 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of Rebel FC held by the Rebel FC Stockholder. The shares of our Common Stock received by the Rebel FC Stockholder in the Share Exchange Transaction then constituted approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. As a result of the Share Exchange Transaction, Rebel FC, together with its subsidiaries, Pure Heart and SCA Capital, became REBL’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
The Share Exchange Agreement contained representations and warranties by us, Rebel FC and the Rebel FC Stockholder which are customary for transactions of this type such as, with respect to the Company: organization, good standing and qualification to do business; capitalization; subsidiaries; authorization and validity of the transaction and transaction documents; consents being obtained or not required to consummate the transaction; no conflict or violation of Articles of Incorporation; with respect to Rebel FC: authorization; capitalization; and title to Rebel FC’s shares of common stock being exchanged, and with respect to Rebel FC Stockholder: authorization; no conflict or violation of law; investment purpose; reliance on exemption on the Company’s Common Stock to be exchanged; and transfer or resale pursuant to the Securities Act.
 
Our acquisition of Rebel FC and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization effected by a share exchange. Rebel FC was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement (the “Equity Transfer Agreement,” such transaction, the “Equity Transfer Transaction”) with MOXC, to sell, transfer, and convey 50,000 ordinary shares of Moxian IP, constituting 100% equity interests of Moxian IP for $6,782,000 (the “Moxian IP Transfer Price”). The Moxian IP Transfer Price for Moxian IP is based on an appraisal report, dated November 15, 2014, prepared by Grant Sherman Appraisal Limited, an independent appraiser.
 
Pursuant to the Equity Transfer Agreement, MOXC agreed to repay the Moxian IP Transfer Price and the Moxian BVI Transfer Price in the aggregate of $7,782,000 in the form of a convertible promissory note (the “Note”) issued by MOXC. The maturity date for the Note was October 30, 2015 with 1% interest per annum, and all sums due under this Note could be converted at the conversion price of $1.00 per share (“Conversion Price”) at the option of MOXC, if the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of MOXC’s common stock for a period of thirty (30) trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion was higher than the Conversion Price. Under the Note, MOXC had a right of first refusal to purchase the shares issuable upon conversion at the price of 80% of the VWAP for 30 trading days immediately prior to the date of the proposed repurchase by MOXC.

On August 14, 2015, due to the VWAP of the MOXC common stock for 30 trading day prior to August 14, 2015 was higher than $1.00, which triggered the clause of conversion under the MOXC Note, MOXC notified us that it elected to convert the amount of $3,891,000 under the MOXC Note into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC common stock at the conversion price of $1.00 (the “August Conversion”). As a result of the August Conversion, the remainder amount of the MOXC Note was $3,891,000.
 
On September 30, 2015, MOXC notified us that it elected to convert the remainder of the MOXC Note, of $3,891,000 into 3,891,000 shares of the MOXC common stock (the “September Conversion”). After the August Conversion and the September Conversion, consequently, all of the MOXC Note was converted in to the total of 7,782,000 shares of the MOXC common stock with no amount of the MOXC Note outstanding. On May 24, 2016, MOXC’s board of directors approved a reverse stock split of MOXC’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-2 (the “MOXC Reverse Stock Split”). The MOXC Reverse Stock Split was effective on June 20, 2016, and pursuant to the MOXC Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s shares in MOXC were reduced from 7,782,000 shares to 3,891,000 shares.
 
Immediately after the completion of the Share Exchange Transaction and the Equity Transfer Transaction, the Company discontinued its social media business and changed its business to producing dynamic Mixed Martial Arts (“MMA”) fighting events and promoting MMA fighting in China and Singapore.
 
Rebel Holdings Limited (Rebel FC), which utilizes the trade name of Rebel Fighting Championship, was incorporated on October 28, 2014 in the British Virgin Islands and engages in the business of hosting and promoting MMA events. On January 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Rebel FC pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization effected by a Share Exchange Transaction. Rebel FC was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.

Ltd.” Effective November 27, 2002, it changed its name to “Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.” It later changed its name from “Asia Pacific Export International Pte Ltd.” to “Pure Heart Entertainment Pte Ltd.” on June 7, 2013.

The following diagram sets forth the structure of the Company as of the date of this Report:
 


Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to become the most recognized MMA sports and media brand in China. To achieve this objective, we intend to employ the following strategies:
 
Hosting Successful Events in China. We have hosted eight MMA events so far. Our two most recent events were held on April 29th 2018 and May 30th 2018, obtaining average viewership of over four million on television and eight million on digital and social media platforms. We intend to leverage the success of our most recent events to increase our ticket sales, sponsorship deals, television distribution and media rights. We plan to achieve the following business revenue projection: Up to US$400,000 in ticket sales and US$9.9 million in sponsorship deals from our currently planned four events in the second half of 2019.


Identifying and Signing Top Chinese Prospects. Rebel will focus its tournament setting strategy on featuring competition between top professional Chinese athletes against highly ranked professional athletes from around the world. In order to achieve that, Rebel will implement a comprehensive scouting program throughout China to identify promising Chinese athletes to join Rebel in multi-fight agreements. This strategy will ensure Rebel to develop and retain top Chinese athletes, which will enhance our positioning in the MMA market and enable Rebel to host high quality tournaments. Rebel’s differential in understanding the Chinese martial arts tradition will enable Rebel to attract the best Chinese fighters to compete on our events. Currently, we have secured three exclusive engagement contract with Wenbo Liu, who is a Chinese middleweight champion of Legend Fighting Championship, a well-known Hong Kong-based MMA promoter. We plan to sign more exclusive engagement contract with more top professional Chinese athletes like Wenbo Liu.

Distributing our Original Content. We intend to leverage our past successes to produce, distribute and monetize our original MMA contents through domestic and international distribution arrangements. We intend to establish live television arrangements with various distribution channels in China and Singapore such as Starhub TV, Guangdong Sports TV, Beijing Sports TV and Qinghai Satellite TV. In addition to television broadcasting, the Company plans to build pay-per-view (“PPV”) viewership model to attract more audiences. PPV is a type of live broadcast service by which a viewer can purchase events to view via private channel at the same time with everyone else ordering it. The Company believes that the PPV model will be deployed in China in 2019 through selected live streaming service providers to enable PPV subscription service for the Company’s MMA events. We plan to distribute our live MMA events through PPV viewership model in 2019 and charge between $5 to $10 for each PPV MMA event.
 
Securing Key Venues. We intend to produce MMA events at key venues in four major Chinese cities-- Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Beijing. This strategy will allow us to build up our brand name in China’s affluent coastal cities and grow our brand and fan base in mid-class Chinese families.
 
Obtaining Sponsorships. Our initial business plan was to obtain sponsorships sufficient to cover our event production costs. However, we desire to increase our revenues through expanding our sponsorships. Currently, we rely on local and regional sponsors for our live events, although we plan to establish sponsorship and advertising arrangements with larger organizations such as Venom and Thomas Cook. For every event moving forward, we target to obtain at least 10 sponsors.
 
*Average cost of one MMA event produced by the Company (USD)
 

Marketing/PR/Branding | 313,292
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------
Logistics and Food and Beverage | 142,237
Fighters’ Compensation | 121,790

License Fee | 14,524 
Labor | 1,307 
Total Estimated Cost | 655,604

 
Development of a Reality Television Show. We plan to produce a 12-episode reality show which will be distributed across major Chinese internet platforms. The show will feature Chinese professional MMA fighters training and competing against each other to win a prize of 1,000,000 RMB. We believe that the show will provide us with an independent revenue stream and a good marketing tool to establish a better brand name recognition in China.
 
Establishment of Adjacent Revenue Streams. The major companies in our industry have utilized their brand to derive revenue by establishing gyms and selling merchandise. For example, UFC derived $19,000,000 (3.5% of their total revenue) from the sale of merchandise in 2015. Thus, we intend to establish our Rebel brand name gyms and produce our own exclusive merchandise in the near future.

Competition
 
The market for live and televised MMA events content is extremely competitive.
 
The main competitors in our industry, specifically in China, which include but are not limited to:
 

● | The Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”);
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Bellator MMA (“Bellator”);
--+---------------------------


● | ONE Fighting Championship (“OFC”), which is based in Singapore and targets the Asia market; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Kunlun Fight, a fighting club located in China which broadcasts its events over the Chinese television channel.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
 

● | The ability to attract and retain successful professional fighters in order to promote events that are appealing to fans and sponsors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to promote a large number of events and bouts so that fighters are willing to commit to multi-fight agreements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to produce high-quality media content on a consistent basis to secure television and other media distribution arrangements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to generate brand awareness in China
--+-------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
Despite the competition we face, we believe that our approach of delivering high quality content concentrating on the untapped combat sports market in China, centered around Chinese fighters and fans, where we believe we have the resources and experience to penetrate the market and grow our business, enables us to address the competitive factors more effectively and thrive in this competitive market. The major MMA promotors, UFC, Bellator, OFC, provide high quality content, however, they mainly focus on promotion in the United States, Latin America, Europe and South-East Asia, and not China. At the same time, the major Chinese promoters focus more on kickboxing and do not provide the same high quality MMA focuses content as Rebel.
 
Based upon Weibo followers, we have signed contracts with three of the nine most popular MMA fighters from China, Wenbo Liu, Ning Guangyou and Yao Honggang. We plan to utilize this local popularity to establish a prominent fan base in MMA crazed China by marketing these up and coming Chinese fighters to the Chinese market.
 
Government Regulation

In order to organize and host a live event in China, we need to obtain a license from the local Police Department. We also need to comply with the rules and regulations required by the State of Administration Radio Film and Television.
 
Rebel counts with the services of a company specialized in handling the documentation and end-to-end process required by the various Chinese departments, such as the police and fire departments, in order to acquire the license to host the events.
