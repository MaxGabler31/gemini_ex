Overview 
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer and other serious diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. By focusing on the genetic drivers of disease, our science seeks to match targeted medicines with the patients who need them. We are developing our lead product candidate, tazemetostat, an oral, first-in-class, selective small molecule inhibitor of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase, or HMT, for the treatment of a broad range of cancer types in multiple treatment settings, and developing our novel G9a program, EZM8266, for the treatment of sickle cell disease, or SCD. 
 We have taken a “pipeline in a product” approach to developing tazemetostat with a broad clinical development program through company-sponsored studies and collaborations. This program is evaluating tazemetostat as both a monotherapy and combination treatment in hematological malignancies and solid tumors for both late and early lines of treatment. Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as a monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. Based on positive data in our two lead indications, epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma, or FL, and interactions with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, we are planning to submit New Drug Applications, or NDAs, for accelerated approval of tazemetostat for each proposed indication in 2019, subject to the results of our ongoing trials in those indications.  
 In our hematological malignancy program, we are conducting a multi-cohort, global Phase 2 study evaluating tazemetostat’s treatment potential in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. Two cohorts are evaluating tazemetostat as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory FL, one of the most prevalent forms of NHL, both with and without EZH2 activating mutations. In December 2018, we completed target enrollment of FL patients in our study, with 54 patients with wild-type EZH2 and 45 patients with EZH2 activating mutations. Based on interactions with the FDA, we believe we have identified a path to submission for accelerated approval of tazemetostat in FL patients with either an EZH2 activating mutation or wild-type EZH2, whose disease has progressed following two or more lines of therapy. We are targeting submission of an NDA for accelerated approval for tazemetostat for FL in this population in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to the results of our ongoing trial in this indication.
 As part of an accelerated approval strategy, we will need 
to conduct a confirmatory clinical program to verify clinical benefit and support the full approval of tazemetostat. We intend to review our proposed confirmatory program with the FDA, and to finalize its design in the 
first half of 2019. We hope 
to leverage the confirmatory 
program to expand tazemetostat into the second-line treatment setting for patients with FL, both with and without EZH2 activating mutations. In addition, we plan to evaluate tazemetostat treatment in combination with other therapies. In mid-2019, we anticipate initiating a combination study that would compare tazemetostat plus rituximab and Revlimid, a chemotherapeutic-free treatment regimen referred to as R2, versus R2 with placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory FL, 
both with and without EZH2 activating mutations. In addition, we are finalizing plans for a trial of tazemetostat in combination with rituxan for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory FL. Based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, we are evaluating the opportunity to investigate this combination as a front-line treatment for patients with FL. In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, we are continuing to evaluate tazemetostat with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with DLBCL. In addition, Genentech Inc., or Genentech, is evaluating the combination of tazemetostat with its checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq (atezolizumab), for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, with preliminary data expected from that study in 2019.  
 In our solid tumor program, we are evaluating tazemetostat’s treatment potential in adults and children with molecularly defined solid tumors, including INI1- and SMARCA4-negative tumors, which we collectively refer to as INI1-negative tumors. We are conducting a multi-cohort global Phase 2 trial of tazemetostat in adults with INI1-negative tumors, including epithelioid sarcoma or chordoma. Based on positive data that we have observed in patients with epithelioid sarcoma in the ongoing Phase 2 study, we are targeting submission of our first NDA for 
 2


accelerated approval of tazemetostat for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma in the second quarter of 2019. In connection with this submission, we will need to conduct a confirmatory program to verify clinical benefit and support the full approval of tazemetostat. We plan to explore with the FDA utilizing the natural history study in epithelioid sarcoma that we are conducting to serve as confirmatory evidence required in connection with any accelerated approval. The cohort of patients in the phase 2 study of chordoma patients is ongoing, and we are evaluating tazemetostat in the dose-expansion portion of a Phase 1 study in pediatric patients with INI1-negative tumors, with plans to report updated data in 2019.
We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan. We intend to build a focused field presence and marketing capabilities to commercialize tazemetostat for the epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma indications in the United States. We have begun building the infrastructure necessary to support the launch and marketing of tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma, and believe we can adequately address this patient population through a modest field force of less than 25 professionals. For geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to reach patients, including through potential collaborations.
 Tazemetostat is covered by claims of U.S. and European composition of matter patents, which are expected to expire in 2032, exclusive of any patent term or other extensions. Tazemetostat has been 
granted Fast Track designation by the FDA 
in patients with relapsed or refractory FL, with or without activating EZH2 mutations, relapsed or refractory DLBCL with EZH2 activating mutations and metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma who have progressed on or following an anthracycline-based treatment regimen. The 
FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with FL, malignant rhabdoid tumors, or MRT, soft tissue sarcoma, or STS, and mesothelioma. The orphan drug designation for the treatment of MRT applies to INI1-negative MRT as well as SMARCA4-negative malignant rhabdoid tumor of ovary, or MRTO. 
 Beyond tazemetostat, we are building 
an early pipeline to 
further support 
our leadership in epigenetics. We are developing our wholly-owned G9a candidate, EZM8266, for the treatment of people with sickle cell disease. We have completed IND-enabling studies for this program and plan to begin clinical evaluation with a safety and dose-finding study in the second half of 2019. In November 2018, we entered a strategic collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel small molecule inhibitors, discovered by us, directed toward two previously unaddressed epigenetic targets as potential therapies for people with cancer. Specifically, these targets are enzymes within the helicase and histone acetyltransferase, or HAT, families that when dysregulated have been linked to the development of cancers that currently lack therapeutic options. We also have collaborations with Glaxo Group Limited (an affiliate of 
GlaxoSmithKline), or GSK, 
focused on the development of PRMT inhibitors discovered by us, and with Celgene Corporation and Celgene RIVOT Ltd., an affiliate of Celgene Corporation, which we collectively refer to as Celgene, focused on the development of pinometostat and small molecule inhibitors directed to three HMT targets.
 Our Corporate Strategy

Partial Clinical Hold
In April 2018, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on new patient enrollment in the United States in our ongoing clinical trials of tazemetostat, following a safety report from one patient in the dose-ranging portion of the Phase 1 study who developed a secondary case of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, or T-LBL. This child had metastatic poorly differentiated chordoma and entered our study with a poor prognosis following several prior treatments. The patient was on a high dose of tazemetostat for 15 months and achieved an objective response. Following the T-LBL diagnosis, the patient discontinued tazemetostat and began a standard treatment for T-LBL. This remains the only case of T-LBL that we have seen in approximately 800 patients treated with tazemetostat. In September 2018, the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold.
 4


To better understand the potential risk of T-LBL in our trials, and the overall benefit-risk of tazemetostat across hematological malignancies and solid tumors in both adults and children, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of tazemetostat based on published literature and the clinical experience with tazemetostat to date. A panel of external scientific and medical experts reviewed and validated the findings for the assessment, and we submitted the assessment to the FDA as part of our complete response submission.
 To resolve the partial clinical hold in the United States, we reconsented all patients in our clinical trials and updated our informed consent form based on the safety report. We also aligned with the FDA on certain amendments to our tazemetostat study protocols focused on increasing patient monitoring and putting in place risk-mitigation strategies designed to reduce the risk of potential future secondary malignancies. 
 In November 2018, Germany’s Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices lifted the partial clinical hold that it had imposed in Germany. The partial clinical hold in France remains in effect. We have re-activated clinical trial sites in the United States, resuming enrollment in our tazemetostat clinical trials at those sites, and are currently re-activating 
sites in Germany to resume enrollment there. We are engaging with regulators in France to work toward similar resolutions in that country. 
 Tazemetostat Clinical Program in Epithelioid Sarcoma and Other INI1-Negative Solid Tumors 
 
Background on Epithelioid Sarcoma: Epithelioid sarcoma is an ultra-rare and aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma, comprising less than 1 percent of all soft tissue sarcoma cases, and is characterized by a loss of the INI1 protein. It is most commonly diagnosed in young adults (20-40 years old) and is often fatal. There is no established standard-of-care for treating these patients, who are typically resistant to chemotherapy. Patients diagnosed with metastatic disease have a 5-year overall survival of less than 20 percent and there are no currently approved treatment options specifically indicated for epithelioid sarcoma. Typically, once patients have been deemed appropriate for systemic therapy, most are treated with chemotherapy. There are an estimated 800 patients in the United States living with epithelioid sarcoma with approximately 300 patients with metastatic disease that would be eligible for systemic therapy. However, because there are no treatments specifically indicated for epithelioid sarcoma, we believe the true prevalence of this disease is unknown.  
Background on INI1-Negative Solid Tumors: INI1 and SMARCA4 are subunits of SWI/SNF, a chromatin modifying protein complex that opposes the activity of PRC2, the complex within which EZH2 resides. Loss of INI1 or SMARCA4 in specific cell backgrounds is believed to cause dysregulation in the balance between SWI/SNF and PRC2, and thus cause tumors to become sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. This effect was observed in a preclinical study of tazemetostat in a xenograft model of MRT in which tazemetostat caused a dose-dependent regression in INI1-negative tumors. INI1-negative tumors can appear in many different tissue types, and can present as epithelioid sarcoma, MRT, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumor and myoepithelial carcinoma, among several others. SMARCA4-negative tumors can also appear as different tumor types, including MRTO. 
 INI1-negative or certain SMARCA4-negative tumors are typically aggressive cancers with few to no approved treatments, as with epithelioid sarcoma. INI1-negative tumors are most commonly seen in infants through young adults, while SMARCA4-negative tumors are most commonly seen in teenagers and young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2,000 new patients (adults and children) with INI1-negative tumors and certain SMARCA4-negative tumors are diagnosed annually in the United States and other major pharmaceutical markets; however, we believe that the actual number may be higher, as these types of molecularly defined cancers are significantly under-reported today. 
 Phase 2 Clinical Program in Adults: We are conducting a multi-cohort, global Phase 2 trial of tazemetostat in adults with INI1-negative tumors, including epithelioid sarcoma or chordoma. Patients in the Phase 2 trial are dosed at 800 mg twice daily with tablets taken orally.
 This trial was designed to enroll up to 250 patients. The patients in the trial were previously stratified into one of five cohorts: 
epithelioid sarcoma (n=
60
), 
rhabdoid tumors (n=30), other INI1-negative tumors (n=30), renal medullary carcinoma (n=30) and synovial sarcoma (n=30). In 2017, we opened two additional cohorts: INI1-negative chordoma (n=30) and a cohort to explore the effect of tazemetostat treatment on immune responsiveness by obtaining paired tumor biopsies in epithelioid sarcoma patients (n=40). The primary endpoint for all cohorts, except synovial sarcoma and the paired biopsy cohort, is overall response rate. The primary endpoint for the synovial sarcoma cohort is disease control, defined as a complete response, partial response, or stable disease, at 16 weeks. 
 5


The primary endpoint for the paired biopsy cohort is assessment of pre- and post-dose biopsies for immune priming (e.g. PD-L1 and CD8 IHC).
 Epithelioid Sarcoma Cohort: The epithelioid sarcoma cohort in our Phase 2 trial represents the largest prospective trial of epithelioid sarcoma with any approved or investigational treatment to date. The cohort was initially designed to enroll 30 patients and was expanded in December 2016 to enroll an additional 30 patients based on encouraging early activity. 
We 
completed enrollment of the 
epithelioid sarcoma cohort in July 2017 with 24 treatment-naïve patients and 38 relapsed or refractory patients for a total of 62 patients. The primary endpoint of the cohort is overall response rate, or ORR, comprised of complete and partial responses as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST 1.1. We are enrolling up to an additional 40 patients in a new cohort to explore the effect of tazemetostat treatment on immune responsiveness by obtaining paired tumor biopsies in these patients.In October 2018, interim 
data from the 62 patients in the ongoing epithelioid cohort of the Phase 2 study were presented during the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Annual Congress. 
Interim data as of the August 21, 2018 data cut-off date showed that tazemetostat treatment demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in the trial, with durable objective responses and encouraging overall survival, and that tazemetostat was generally well-tolerated. As of the data cut-off date, eight patients had 
confirmed objective responses for an ORR of 13 percent in the overall intent-to-treat population. In the subset 
of 24 
patients who were treatment-naïve, 5 patients had confirmed objective responses for 
an ORR of 21 percent, and in the subset of 38 
relapsed or refractory patients
, 3 patients had confirmed objective responses for 
an ORR or eight percent. Since the data cut-off, one additional patient in the treatment-naïve subgroup subsequently achieved an objective response, bringing the total to six responders in the treatment-naïve group, for an ORR of 24 percent, and to nine responders in the overall intent-to-treat population, for an ORR of 15 percent.
 Key secondary endpoints include durability of response, overall survival and safety. As of the data cut-off date, in the intent-to-treat population
, tazemetostat has demonstrated a median duration of response of 48 weeks and is still ongoing. In the treatment-naïve subset and the relapsed or refractory subset, tazemetostat demonstrated a median duration of response of 41 weeks and 48 weeks, respectively, and are still ongoing. The interim median overall survival for the intent-to-treat population was 82.4 weeks. For the subset of relapsed or refractory patients, the median overall survival was 47.4 weeks, and the median overall survival for the treatment-naïve patients had not yet been reached.
 Other secondary 
endpoints that are markers of clinical activity are the disease control rate, or DCR, which is comprised of confirmed objective responses for any duration or disease stabilization of 32 weeks or more, and progression-free survival, or PFS. The DCR and the PFS rates in the intent-to-treat population were 24 percent and 16.1 weeks, respectively. The median PFS was 
25.7 weeks in the 
treatment-naïve patients and 
14.7 weeks 
in the relapsed or refractory patients. DCR for treatment-naïve patients was 38 percent and 16 percent in relapsed or refractory patients.
 Tazemetostat was generally well-tolerated in epithelioid sarcoma patients, with no discontinuations or deaths due to treatment-related adverse events, or AE’s. The majority of treatment-related AE’s were grade 1or 2, and only 13 percent of patients experienced a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AE. Treatment-related events with an incidence of 10 percent or greater were fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea and weight decrease, and anemia. 
 Due to a lack of treatment options and the severity of epithelioid sarcoma, we believe that this patient population may represent the fastest potential path to a first NDA submission, approval and commercial launch for tazemetostat. Based on positive data from the ongoing study, we plan to submit our first NDA to the FDA for accelerated approval of 
tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma in the second quarter of 2019. 
In connection with this submission and an accelerated approval, we would need to 
conduct a confirmatory program to verify clinical benefit and support full approval of tazemetostat. We plan to explore with the FDA utilizing the natural history study in epithelioid sarcoma that we are conducting to serve as confirmatory evidence required in connection with any accelerated approval. We are in the process of completing a multi-center study with a comprehensive benchmarking of current therapies, the clinical experience with those regimens, and treatment efficacy and safety in epithelioid sarcoma patients. We expect the data from this natural history study
, which is 
largest of its kind in epithelioid sarcoma patients, 
will further contextualize the data observed with tazemetostat in epithelioid sarcoma patients and highlight the need for a meaningful new treatment option with therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. If our 
 6


planned NDA is submitted and granted accelerated approval in 2019, we anticipate that we could commercially launch tazemetostat as early as 2020.   
 Other INI1-Negative Tumor Cohorts: In November 2017, we reported that both the malignant rhabdoid tumor cohort and other INI1-negative tumor cohorts of the ongoing Phase 2 study surpassed their futility assessment with objective responses observed in both populations; however, the activity was not sufficient to warrant continued development in these cohorts. We added an additional cohort specifically for chordoma patients due to the previously observed high rate of enrollment of these patients in the other INI1-negative cohort of the Phase 2 study. Assessment of tazemetostat activity in this cohort remains ongoing.   
 Phase 1 Clinical Program in Children: We are conducting a global Phase 1 clinical trial of tazemetostat in approximately 110 children with INI1-negative solid tumors. We have completed the dose-escalation portion and have advanced to the dose-expansion stage of this trial. In the trial, we used an oral suspension formula of tazemetostat. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety, with the objective of establishing the recommended Phase 2 dose in pediatric patients. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, objective response rate, duration of response, PFS and overall survival. Enrollment is completed in all cohorts with the exception of the chordoma cohort and other INI1-negative solid tumors.  
 In May 2018 at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) Conference, data from the dose- escalation portion of the Phase 1 study were presented. Forty-six patients were treated with seven dose levels, ranging from 240 to 1200 mg/m2 of twice-daily tazemetostat. Four patients who were treated at doses from 520 to 900 mg/m2 demonstrated RECIST/RANO-confirmed objective responses.
Tazemetostat Clinical Program in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 
 We are executing a broad clinical development program for tazemetostat as both a monotherapy and combination treatment in relapsed or refractory and first-line NHL. We recently identified a path to submission for accelerated approval 
of tazemetostat in EZH2 mutant and wild-type FL patient populations, 
for patients whose disease has progressed following two or more lines of therapy. We also plan to seek to expand FL use into early lines of FL treatment through different combination regimens. We are also leveraging strategic collaborations to explore tazemetostat as a combination therapy in patients with DLBCL.
 
Background on NHL: Two types of NHL, FL and DLBCL of germinal center origin, are associated with oncogenic EZH2 mutations. In our preclinical studies, we observed that NHL cells were sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors such as tazemetostat and that NHL cells bearing EZH2 mutations were particularly responsive to such treatment. EZH2 plays a critical role at various stages in normal B-cell maturation, and a particularly important role during the stage of B-cell development known as the germinal center reaction. Recent research has demonstrated that EZH2 acts as a key gatekeeper for B-cell maturation and differentiation. Our own ongoing research suggests that it is a combination of stem or progenitor cell of origin together with specific genetic lesions that confer sensitivity of cancer cells to EZH2 inhibition. An analysis of patient samples with germinal center derived NHL has revealed a number of genetic alterations that impact EZH2 function in ways that may confer sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. While FL remains our lead NHL target patient population for tazemetostat, our clinical and preclinical data suggest patients with other forms of B-cell NHL may also benefit from tazemetostat. We may explore the development of tazemetostat for those other forms of B-cell NHL.
 Background on FL: The population of patients with FL is large and growing. FL is considered to be incurable with existing treatments and is characterized by cycles of relapse that become increasingly difficult to treat with each disease progression. We estimate that the number of treatment-eligible FL patients in the United States and five largest European Union countries as measured by population, or EU5, is approximately 36,000 patients and 30,000 patients, respectively. Based on literature and an extensive natural history study that we conducted, we believe that approximately 20% of FL tumors carry an EZH2 activating mutation. Common treatments for FL include multi-agent chemotherapy, usually combined with rituximab (Rituxan), including R-CHOP and R-Bendamustine. Upon clinical progression, salvage treatment regimens are typically other combinations of rituximab and other chemotherapy drugs or duvelisib, idealisib or copanlisib. There are no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with FL with an EZH2 mutation.
 7


Phase 2 Clinical Program: We are conducting a multi-cohort, global Phase 2 study evaluating tazemetostat’s treatment potential in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL. Two cohorts are evaluating tazemetostat as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory FL, one with patients with EZH2 activating mutations and one with patients with wild-type EZH2. Two cohorts were evaluating tazemetostat as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, one with patients with EZH2 activating mutations and one with patients with wild-type EZH2, and an additional arm was evaluating tazemetostat as a combination agent with prednisone in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. 
 Follicular Lymphoma Cohorts: We have completed target enrollment of both FL cohorts in the Phase 2 trial, including 45 patients with EZH2 activating mutations and 54 patients with wild-type EZH2. Patients in the trial are dosed with tazemetostat at 800 mg twice daily with tablets taken orally. The primary endpoint of the trial in these cohorts is overall response rate. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, progression free survival, overall survival, safety and population pharmacokinetics. 
 In June 2018, at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association, we presented updated interim data of tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with FL. As of the May 1, 2018 data cut-off date, in 28 evaluable EZH2 mutation patients, we observed 
a confirmed objective response rate of 71 percent, with 
11 percent of patients having achieved a complete response and 61 percent of patients having achieved a partial response
.  In addition, 
as 
of the data cut-off date, these patients had 
a median PFS of 49 weeks and a median duration of response of 32 weeks. Both endpoints 
have continued to mature since that cutoff. In the 54 evaluable wild-type EZH2 patients, we observed 
a confirmed objective response rate of 33 percent, with six percent of patients having achieved a complete response and 28 percent of patients having achieved a partial response. As of the data cut-off date, these patients had 
a median PFS of 30 weeks and a median duration of response of 76 weeks
 with the median duration of response continuing to mature, with more than half of the patients with responses still on therapy at the time. Notably, 100 percent of patients with an EZH2 activating mutation and 78 percent of patients with wild-type EZH2 experienced a reduction in tumor burden, an important measure of disease stabilization and clinical response in this unmet need population.
 In addition, tazemetostat has been generally well-tolerated in this study. Interim safety results as of May 1, 2018 showed only six percent of FL patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported across 17 percent of patients, the most frequent of which included thrombocytopenia, anemia, asthenia and fatigue.
 We are conducting a 
natural history study of approximately 1000 FL patients to evaluate whether or not patients with EZH2 activating mutations are more likely to respond to any treatment than patients with wild-type EZH2. The data collection will occur from international lymphoma centers of excellence. Preliminary findings from this retrospective study showed a 
frequency of EZH2 mutations that is consistent with 
our estimated 
20% regardless of the line of treatment; that patients with EZH2 activating mutations are not hyper-responsive to any treatment in any line of therapy; and that overall survival is equivalent for both FL patient populations when treated with currently available therapies. These data strengthen our belief that the benefits observed with tazemetostat in our Phase 2 study are due to tazemetostat treatment.
 Based on 
interactions 
with the FDA
, we believe 
we have 
identified a path to submission for accelerated approval of 
tazemetostat in FL patients with either EZH2 activating mutations or wild-type EZH2, whose disease has progressed following two or more lines of therapy. Based on this strategy, we anticipate submitting an NDA for this indication in the fourth quarter of 2019. As part of an accelerated approval strategy, we will need to conduct a confirmatory clinical program to verify clinical benefit and support the full approval of tazemetostat. We intend to review our proposed confirmatory program with the FDA, and to finalize its design in the first half of 2019. We continue to discuss with the FDA whether or not a companion or complementary diagnostic would be necessary. In parallel, we continue to collaborate with Roche Molecular Systems Inc. on the development of a companion or complementary diagnostic, if necessary. We hope to leverage the confirmatory program to expand tazemetostat into the second-line treatment setting for patients with FL, both with and without EZH2 activating mutations. In addition, we plan to evaluate the use of tazemetostat for the treatment of FL in combination with other therapies.
 Based on interim data assessments in the Phase 2 study cohorts evaluating tazemetostat as a monotherapy and combination agent with prednisolone in relapsed or refractory patients with DLBCL, we determined that the activity 
 8


observed was not sufficient to warrant further development of tazemetostat for DLBCL as monotherapy or in combination with prednisolone.
 Tazemetostat Combination Studies in NHL:  In addition to evaluating tazemetostat as a monotherapy for FL, we are investigating the combination of tazemetostat with other cancer agents in both the relapsed or refractory and front-line settings of NHL. 
  
• | FL Combinations. We have seen extensive preclinical synergy of tazemetostat with a number of targeted agents and chemotherapies used for, or in development for the treatment of FL. Based on the monotherapy efficacy and safety data generated to-date, we plan to explore the potential of tazemetostat in earlier lines of FL as combination therapy. In 2019, we intend to initiate a study that would assess the activity of tazemetostat in combination with the chemotherapeutic-free treatment regimen of rituximab and Revlimid, known as R2, versus R2 with placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory FL. In addition, we are finalizing plans for a trial of tazemetostat in combination with rituxan for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory FL. Based on the clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP as a front-line treatment for patients with DLBCL, we are considering opportunities to expand the evaluation of this combination into treatment-naïve, high-risk patients with FL.

• | DLBCL Combination with R-CHOP. We are studying tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP, in collaboration with LYSA, a premier cooperative group in France dedicated to clinical and translational research for lymphoma. This multi-center Phase 1b/2 trial in front-line, elderly high-risk patients with DLBCL is enrolling up to 133 patients. Primary endpoints in the trial include complete response rate, safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints include ORR and PFS. The trial was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016. At ASH 2018, LYSA reported interim data from 17 patients in the trial as of March 2018 showing that the combination of the two agents had been generally well-tolerated and confirming the recommended tazemetostat dose for the combination to be 800 mg twice-daily. Clinical activity was observed, with 87 percent of patients experiencing a metabolic complete response.

• | Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Based on preclinical evidence showing that EZH2 inhibition may enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Genentech to conduct a global Phase 1b trial combining tazemetostat with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor. The global trial was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is being conducted by Genentech. In March 2018, Genentech completed enrollment of the trial with 45 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Primary endpoints in the trial include safety and combination tolerability with the objective of establishing a recommended Phase 2 dose. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include overall response, objective response, duration of response, pharmacokinetics and preliminary biomarker assessment. Preliminary data from this study are anticipated to be reported in 2019.

Tazemetostat in Other Solid Tumors
 We intend to expand the clinical investigation of tazemetostat to other solid tumors. This includes defining new monotherapy indications based on a strong scientific rationale and patient stratifications, and identifying key pathways for synergistic combinations that would enhance efficacy without compromising safety. We intend to do this by targeting specific patient populations where there is an unmet need, looking at indications for which there are efficient regulatory paths and areas where tazemetostat can be highly competitive.
 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed and second most frequent cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. We believe, based on published literature, that EZH2 protein expression has been correlated with progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC; moderate to high EZH2 expression has been associated with worse failure-free survival; and, treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor after resistance to the standards-of-care results in recovery of sensitivity to these agents. We are planning to begin a clinical study in mid-2019 evaluating tazemetostat for people with resistant CRPC in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide, the standard-of-care treatments for this disease.

Platinum-Resistant Solid Tumors: We are also planning to investigate the therapeutic potential of tazemetostat as a combination therapy with a PARP inhibitor for the treatment of platinum-resistant tumors, such as small-cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In platinum-resistant cancers, PARP inhibitors have shown modest monotherapy activity, and we believe tazemetostat may have the potential to enhance the clinical response to PARP inhibitors. External research suggests that when DNA damage occurs, PARP enzymes catalyze modification of EZH2 which leads to decreased EZH2 enzyme activity. We believe that by adding an EZH2 inhibitor to a PARP inhibitor, certain cancer cell lines may have increased sensitivity and response to PARP inhibition. We plan to initiate a basket study in select tumor types in the second half of 2019.
 
CRADA with NCI: In October 2016, we announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, to evaluate tazemetostat in clinical trials in a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Under this CRADA, we plan to evaluate tazemetostat in a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with ovarian cancer and in a Phase 2 trial in pediatric patients with solid tumors and lymphoma. As part of the CRADA, we may undertake additional clinical trials. NCI will predominantly fund the studies and manage trial operations.
 In July 2017, we announced that the NCI’s Pediatric MATCH trial will include a Phase 2 evaluation of tazemetostat as one of its treatment cohorts. Conducted under our CRADA executed with NCI in 2016, this multi-institutional trial will evaluate tazemetostat as a monotherapy for pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors, including CNS tumors, NHL or histiocytic disorders that harbor EZH2 activating mutations, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4. The Pediatric MATCH trial, conducted by the Children’s Oncology Group, aims to match targeted agents, such as tazemetostat, with specific molecular changes identified through genomic sequencing of refractory or recurrent tumors from children and adolescents with cancer is now enrolling patients.
 G9a Inhibitory Program for Sickle Cell Disease
 Background on G9a: Elevation of fetal hemoglobin, which is normally silenced after birth, has been shown to have disease-modifying potential for patients with β-globinopathies, such as sickle cell disease, and β-thalassemia. Multiple academic groups previously identified that inhibition of G9a, an HMT, leads to increased levels of fetal hemoglobin in preclinical in vitro studies.
 Background on Sickle Cell Disease: Sickle cell disease is an inherited red blood cell disorder. People with sickle cell disease have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin, in their red blood cells. A monogenic disease, sickle cell disease is most common in people with African ancestry. Approximately 300,000 people have sickle cell disease globally, with an estimated 150,000 of those patients located in the United States and Europe. Potential complications include stroke, vaso-occlusive crises associated with pain attacks, acute chest syndrome and anemia. Recurrent acute pain crises and chronic long-term organ damage are the hallmarks for sickle cell disease. However, symptoms can vary significantly in different patients, and better treatments for sickle cell disease patients are needed. Life expectancy of sickle cell disease patients still lags the life expectancy of the general population.
 EZM8266 Program: Building upon the industry’s findings on the G9a target, our scientists leveraged our expertise in HMT drug discovery to generate potent, selective inhibitors of G9a with drug-like properties. We initially developed a tool compound that induced on-target elevation of fetal hemoglobin in cell culture assays, and elicited significant increases in mouse embryonic hemoglobin, which is the rodent developmental equivalent of human fetal hemoglobin. We believe these findings represent the first in vivo study to demonstrate reactivation of developmental hemoglobin with a G9a inhibitor. Following these efforts, we went on to identify the next product candidate in our pipeline, EZM8266, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable G9a inhibitor. Throughout 2018, we completed the necessary pre-IND work, including good laboratory practice and toxicology studies. We plan to submit and IND and initiate clinical development for EZM8266 for the treatment of people with sickle cell disease, beginning with a dose-finding and safety study in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2019. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to EZM8266.

Pinometostat for DOT1L Cancers 
 Background on DOT1L Cancers. DOT1L is an HMT that can become oncogenic and cause certain subtypes of acute leukemia, such as MLL-r. We discovered pinometostat using our proprietary drug discovery product platform.
 Through external collaborators, the ability to enhance pinometostat’s efficacy in leukemia through combinations with other anti-cancer agents is being explored in preclinical studies. We retain all U.S. rights to pinometostat and have granted Celgene an exclusive license to pinometostat outside of the United States. Pinometostat has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL.
 Under the CRADA that we entered with the NCI in October 2016 for pinometostat, the NCI has agreed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pinometostat in patients with acute leukemias. Initial studies will evaluate the combination of pinometostat with standard-of-care therapies or targeted agents in acute leukemia. As part of the agreement, additional clinical trials will be considered. NCI will predominantly fund the studies and manage trial operations.
 Other Pipeline Programs 
 In addition to tazemetostat, pinometostat and EZM8266, we also have a pipeline of drug discovery programs that target other prioritized chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs. These programs are directed against both hematological malignancies and solid tumors and include approaches to patient stratifications. 
 In November 2018, we entered into a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel small molecules, directed toward two previously undisclosed epigenetic targets as potential therapies for people with cancer. Specifically, these targets are enzymes within the helicase and histone acetyltransferase, or HAT, families that when dysregulated have been linked to the development of cancers that currently lack therapeutic options. We plan to work with Boehringer Ingelheim in 2019 on these two programs. 
 Under our collaboration with GSK, GSK is developing two small molecule inhibitors against novel HMT targets, that were discovered by us using our proprietary drug discovery platform. In September 2016, GSK advanced the first of these programs into clinical testing. This drug candidate, GSK3326595, a PRMT5 inhibitor, is currently being tested in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors and NHL. In 2018, GSK initiated patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of GSK3368715, a PRMT1 inhibitor.
 Under our collaboration with Celgene, we are developing small molecule inhibitors directed to three HMT targets, in addition to pinometostat. Under the collaboration, we are responsible for all preclinical discovery work as well as Phase 1 clinical development for all three targets. Celgene has the option to acquire worldwide rights to inhibitors directed at two of the three targets, and the option to acquire ex-U.S. rights to inhibitors directed to the third target. We retain rights to develop and commercialize inhibitors directed at the third target in the United States. 
 Our Epigenetic Approach 
 Epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression without altering the makeup of the genes themselves. Genes are composed of DNA, and in nature, this DNA is wrapped around a core of proteins known as histones. Together, the DNA and histone proteins form a complex known as chromatin that is the basic structural component of chromosomes. 
 Gene regulation is determined by chromatin structure. The dynamics of chromatin structure are regulated through multiple mechanisms by chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs. Some CMPs place chemical groups onto specific sites on histones or DNA, some remove these marks in site-specific ways, others recognize the uniquely marked sites on histones and bind to these marked sites, and still other CMPs drive topological changes to histone-DNA interactions within chromatin. Where, when and how such chromatin structure changes occur, determines which genes in a cell are turned “on” or “off” at any particular time. When the function of these CMPs is altered, the program of gene expression is changed in ways that can lead to disease. 
 11


We are discovering and developing inhibitors of CMPs as novel therapeutics for patients with cancer and other diseases. Our focus is on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule inhibitors of CMPs for applications in diseases that are uniquely dependent on the enzyme activity of a specific CMP. Among the CMP target classes, we have had a particular emphasis on the HMTs, which have been shown to play pathogenic roles in a number of human diseases. Today, we have programs in HMTs as well as the newer target classes, histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases, which are the subject of our 2018 collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Beyond cancer, however, HMTs and other CMPs have been implicated as pathogenic drivers of a number of diseases with significant unmet medical need. At the end of 2017 we nominated our first development candidate, EZM8266, a HMT inhibitor targeting sickle cell disease. Targeting pathogenic CMPs affords us multiple opportunities to create, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics.
 Our Collaborations  
 We have entered into several key strategic collaborations. These therapeutic collaborations have provided us with $232.8 million in non-equity funding through December 31, 2018. Our Celgene, GSK, and Boehringer Ingelheim collaborations provide us with the potential for significant research, development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments as well as royalties or profit sharing on net product sales. Our Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration provides for research funding and our Celgene and Boehringer Ingelheim collaborations also provide for potential development co-funding. In addition, we have entered into a collaboration to develop a companion diagnostic with Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche Molecular. Key terms of these collaborations are summarized below. 
 Celgene
Overview. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment and restatement of our collaboration and license agreement dated April 2012 with Celgene. Under the original agreement, we granted Celgene an exclusive license, for all countries other than the United States, to small molecule HMT inhibitors targeting the DOT1L HMT, including pinometostat, and an option, on a target-by-target basis, to exclusively license, for all countries other than the United States, rights to small molecule HMT inhibitors targeting any HMT targets, other than EZH2 HMT, including tazemetostat, and targets covered by our pre-existing collaboration and license agreement dated January 8, 2011 with GSK. Under the original agreement, Celgene’s option was exercisable during an option period that would have expired in July 2015. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement: 

• | Celgene retained its exclusive license to small molecule HMT inhibitors targeting DOT1L, including pinometostat,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Celgene’s other option rights were narrowed to small molecule HMT inhibitors targeting three predefined targets, which we refer to as the Option Targets,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The exclusive licenses to HMT inhibitors targeting two of the Option Targets that Celgene may acquire were expanded to include the United States, with the exclusive license to HMT inhibitors targeting the third Option Target continuing to be for all countries other than the United States,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Celgene’s option period was extended for each of the Option Targets and Celgene’s option is exercisable at the time of our investigational new drug application, or IND, filing for an HMT inhibitor targeting the applicable Option Target, upon the payment by Celgene at such time of a pre-specified development milestone-based license payment,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Celgene’s license may be maintained beyond the end of Phase 1 clinical development for each of the Option Targets, upon payment by Celgene at such time of a pre-specified development milestone-based license payment, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our research and development obligations with respect to each Option Target under the amended agreement were extended for at least an additional three years, subject to Celgene exercising its option with respect to such Option Target at IND filing. Subject to our opt-out rights, our research and development obligations were expanded to include the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial as to each Option Target following Celgene’s exercise of its option at IND filing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through December 31, 2018, we have recognized $99.2 million in total collaboration revenue. To date, we have received $75.0 million in upfront payments (including $10.0 million as part of the amended and restated agreement) and $25.0 million from the sale of our series C preferred stock to an affiliate of Celgene, of which $3.0 million was considered a premium and included as collaboration arrangement consideration for total upfront payments of $78.0 million. In addition, we have received a $25.0 million clinical development milestone payment in 2014 and $7.0 million in global development co-funding through December 31, 2018. We are eligible to earn an aggregate of up to $75.0 million in development milestones and license payments, up to $365.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $170.0 million in sales milestone payments related to the three Option Targets. We are eligible to earn $35.0 million in an additional clinical development milestone payment and up to $100.0 million in regulatory milestone payments related to DOT1L.
We are also eligible to receive royalties as follows: 
  
• | As to DOT1L, we retain all product rights in the United States and are eligible to receive royalties at defined percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens on annual net product sales outside of the United States, subject to reductions in specified circumstances;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As to the Option Target for which Celgene’s option rights do not include the United States, if Celgene exercises its option as to such Option Target, we will retain all product rights in the United States and will be eligible to receive royalties, once an initial threshold of net product sales (for which we will not receive royalties) is exceeded, at defined percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits on net product sales outside of the United States, subject to reductions in specified circumstances; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As to the other two Option Targets, if Celgene exercises its option as to those Option Targets, we will be eligible to receive royalties, once an initial threshold of net product sales (for which we will not receive royalties) is exceeded, for each such Option Target at defined percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits on net product sales on a worldwide basis, subject to reductions in specified circumstances.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For DOT1L and, after Celgene’s payment of the specified IND filing license payment for each Option Target, for each such Option Target, we are responsible for the conduct and funding of Phase 1 clinical trials, subject to our right to opt-out of such responsibilities as described below. Celgene may obtain a license to small molecule HMT inhibitors targeting each Option Target at the time of our IND filing for an HMT inhibitor for such target by exercising its option and paying us a specified license payment. Celgene may maintain its license with respect to an Option Target at the conclusion of the Phase 1 clinical trial of the Option Target by paying us a specified additional license payment. If Celgene does not elect to obtain a license during the option exercise period applicable to an Option Target, or to pay the specified IND license payment or end of Phase 1 license payment, we will retain worldwide rights to HMT inhibitors directed to the Option Target, other than HMT inhibitors that may be provided by Celgene if we were to agree to their introduction into the collaboration. 
 Research Obligations. We are primarily responsible for the research strategy under the collaboration. During each applicable option period we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out an agreed research plan for each Option Target, subject to our Opt-Out right described below. For the DOT1L target and each of the Option Targets, we are required to conduct and solely fund development costs of the Phase 1 clinical trials for HMT inhibitors directed to such targets, including for pinometostat. After completion of Phase 1 development, as to DOT1L and the Option Target for which we retain U.S. rights, we and Celgene will equally co-fund global development and each party will solely fund territory-specific development costs for its territory; and, as to the other two Option Targets, after completion of Phase 1 development, Celgene will solely fund all development costs on a worldwide basis. 
 Governance. Our collaboration with Celgene is guided by (a) a joint research committee, with authority over all activities performed under the research plan with respect to the two Option Targets as to which we granted worldwide rights; (b) a joint development committee, with authority over shared development activities with respect to DOT1L and the Option Target for which we retain U.S. rights; and (c) a joint commercialization committee, with authority over the commercialization of products developed under shared development programs with respect to DOT1L and the Option Target for which we retain U.S. rights. Subject to limitations specified in the amended and restated agreement, if the applicable governance committee is not able to make a decision by consensus and the 
 13


parties are not able to resolve the issue through escalation to specified senior executive officers of the parties, then (a) prior to Celgene’s exercise of its option, we generally have final decision-making authority over research and development matters with respect to the Option Targets; (b) with respect to DOT1L and any Option Targets for which Celgene has exercised its option, Celgene generally has final decision-making authority over global development matters, including over global activities and related expenses that we are obligated to co-fund, unless we exercise our opt-out right as to such licensed program, and except that with respect to the Option Target for which we retain U.S. rights, the parties have mutual decision-making authority even after Celgene exercises its option as long as Celgene engages in a competitive development program with respect to such Option Target. Each party has final decision-making authority over commercialization matters in its respective territory. 
 Opt-Out Right. On an Option Target-by-Option Target basis, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to opt-out of further participation in any research and/or development activities after completion of the initial research plan and prior to the filing of an IND for an HMT inhibitor directed to the applicable Option Target, or the Pre-IND Opt-Out. Following exercise of a Pre-IND Opt-Out, if Celgene exercises its option as to the Option Target, Celgene will no longer be required, to the extent not already paid, to make the specified IND license payment or end of Phase 1 license payment to us, specified sales milestone payments will no longer be payable and all royalties on net product sales of applicable licensed products that become payable to us will be reduced by a specified percentage. Additionally, if Celgene exercises its option as to such Option Target, we are obligated to grant Celgene an exclusive worldwide license to HMT inhibitors directed to the applicable Option Target, even if we would otherwise retain U.S. rights to HMT inhibitors directed to the applicable Option Target. Additionally, on a licensed program-by-licensed program basis, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to opt-out of further participation in and co-funding of development, other than specified costs necessary to complete development activities in process at the time we exercise our opt-out right. We can exercise our licensed program opt-out right at specified times: (a) when the clinical trial stopping rules set forth in a clinical trial protocol for DOT1L or the Option Target for which the we retain U.S. rights dictate that such clinical trial be stopped, or the Post-EOP1 Clinical Opt-Out; or (b) for any or no reason, in a licensed program for DOT1L or the Option Target for which we retain U.S. rights, during specified periods before the scheduled initiation of the first pivotal clinical trial or before the estimated date of filing of the first NDA for an HMT inhibitor directed to the licensed target or any time after regulatory approval of an HMT inhibitor directed to the licensed target, or the Late Stage Opt-Out. In the event of a Post-EOP1 Clinical Opt-Out, the royalties that become payable to us on net product sales of licensed products directed to DOT1L or the Option Target for which we retain U.S. rights, as applicable, will be reduced by a specified percentage. Following a Post-EOP1 Clinical Opt-Out or a Late Stage Opt-Out, we are no longer required to co-fund global development for the applicable program other than specified costs necessary to complete development activities in process at the time we exercise our opt-out right, and we are obligated to grant Celgene an exclusive license to HMT inhibitors directed to the applicable target in the United States. Following our exercise of a Post-EOP1 Clinical Opt-Out or a Late Stage Opt-Out, if any, we would be eligible to receive specified milestone payments and royalties based on net product sales in the United States of HMT inhibitors directed to the licensed target in the event that Celgene develops and commercializes a product in the United States. 
 Exclusivity Restrictions. Subject to exceptions specified in the amended agreement, during the option period, we may not research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to DOT1L and the three Option Targets. Subject to exceptions specified in the amended agreement, following each applicable option period, we may not research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to DOT1L or any target licensed by Celgene. 
 Right of First Negotiation. The amended and restated agreement eliminated the right of first negotiation that we had previously granted to Celgene under the original agreement with respect to business combination transactions that we may desire to pursue with third parties. 
 Term and Termination. The amended and restated agreement with Celgene will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the date of the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to each licensed product in each country and in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms for all licensed products in all countries. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage, specified regulatory exclusivity or 15 years following the first commercial sale in the applicable country. Celgene has the right to terminate the amended agreement in its entirety, upon 60 or 120 days’ notice depending on the timing of such termination. The amended agreement may also be terminated in its 
 14


entirety during the option period, and on a licensed target-by-licensed target basis after the option period, by either Celgene or us in the event of a material breach by the other party. The amended agreement may be terminated on a licensed target-by-licensed target basis by either Celgene or us in the event the other party, or an affiliate or sublicensee of the other party, participates or actively assists in a legal challenge to specified patents of the terminating party or in its entirety in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. 
 GlaxoSmithKline 
 Overview. In January 2011, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with GSK to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule HMT inhibitors directed to available targets from our product platform. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted GSK the option to obtain exclusive worldwide license rights to HMT inhibitors directed to three targets. In March 2014, we and GSK amended certain terms of this agreement for the third licensed target, revising the license terms with respect to candidate compounds and amending the corresponding financial terms, including reallocating milestone payments and increasing royalty rates as to the third target. Additionally, as part of the research collaboration provided for in the agreement, we agreed to provide research and development services related to the licensed targets pursuant to agreed-upon research plans during a research term that ended January 8, 2015, or earlier if selection of a development candidate occurred. 
 
Under the agreement, we have recognized as collaboration revenue a $20.0 million upfront payment, a $3.0 million payment upon the execution of the March 2014 agreement amendment, $6.0 million in fixed research funding, $9.0 million for research and development services and $51.0 million in preclinical research and development milestone payments. 
 These preclinical and research and development milestone payments include a $12.0 million milestone payment earned in 2018 relating to the first dosing of a patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of GSK3326595, a PRMT5 inhibitor discovered by us and licensed to GSK under the collaboration agreement, as well as a $8.0 million milestone payment earned in the fourth quarter of 2018 relating to the initiation of a patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of GSK3368715, a PRMT1 inhibitor discovered by us and licensed to GSK under the collaboration agreement. 
 
In addition, a $10.0 million milestone payment earned in May 2017 related to the second target in the collaboration, upon GSK’s initiation of GLP toxicology studies, as well as a $6.0 million clinical milestone recognized in the third quarter of 2016 following GSK’s initiation of patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of a PRMT5 inhibitor that we discovered and licensed to GSK are included in the total of preclinical research and development milestone payments.
 Subsequent to a GSK strategic portfolio prioritization, we received notice in October 2017 that GSK terminated the agreement with respect to the third target, effective December 31, 2017, which returns all rights to that target to us. The two other targets continue to be subject to the agreement and are not impacted by the termination. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we are eligible to earn up to $50.0 million in clinical development milestone payments, up to $197.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $128.0 million in sales-based milestone payments. As a result of the termination of the agreement as it relates to the third target, we will receive no additional payments related to that target. In addition, GSK is required to pay us royalties, at percentages from the mid-single digits to the low double-digits, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on worldwide net product sales, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, the Company may not receive any additional milestone payments or royalty payments from GSK. 
 15


For each selected target in the collaboration, we were primarily responsible for research until the earlier of selection of a development candidate for the target or January 8, 2015, and GSK is solely responsible for subsequent development and commercialization. GSK provided a fixed amount of research funding during the second and third years of the research term and was obligated to provide research funding equal to 100.0% of mutually agreed research and development costs, subject to specified limitations, for any research activities we conducted in the fourth year of the research term. At this stage, GSK is solely responsible for subsequent development and commercialization. 
 Exclusivity Provisions. Subject to exceptions specified in the agreement, during the term of the agreement, we may not research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to the two targets selected by GSK, other than pursuant to the agreement. 
 Term and Termination. The agreement will expire in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms for all licensed products in all countries. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the later of expiration of specified patent coverage or ten years following the first commercial sale. GSK has the right to terminate the agreement at any time with respect to one or more selected targets or in its entirety, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated with respect to one or more selected targets or in its entirety by either GSK or us in the event of a material breach by the other party. The agreement may be terminated with respect to selected targets by us in the event GSK participates or actively assists in a legal challenge to one of the patents exclusively licensed to GSK under the agreement with respect to the applicable selected target. 
Boehringer Ingelheim
 Overview. In November 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to discover, research, develop and commercialize small molecule compounds that are inhibitors of an undisclosed histone acetyl transferase, or HAT target and an undisclosed helicase target, along with associated predictive biomarkers. 
 During a defined research period, we will perform research activities aimed at achieving certain criteria with respect to a HAT inhibiting compound and a helicase inhibiting compound. The research period will expire on December 31, 2019, unless Boehringer Ingelheim elects to extend the research period and we agree, which may be extended through December 31, 2020.
 Following satisfaction of certain criteria with respect to a HAT inhibiting compound, Boehringer Ingelheim shall be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of such compound and products containing such compound throughout the world. BI shall bear the costs of such development and commercialization.
 Following satisfaction of certain criteria with respect to the helicase inhibiting compound, Boehringer Ingelheim shall be responsible for the development and commercialization of such compound and products containing such compound in all countries throughout the world other than the United States, whereas we and Boehringer Ingelheim will work together through a joint steering committee to develop and commercialize the HAT inhibiting compound in the United States. With respect to commercializing the HAT inhibiting compound in the United States, we and Boehringer Ingelheim will equally share (50:50) such commercialization costs and activities.
 Upon execution of the collaboration agreement, Boehringer Ingelheim agreed to pay us a $15.0 million upfront payment. Boehringer Ingelheim also agreed to pay us research funding of $5.0 million in calendar year 2019 and potentially additional research funding in calendar year 2020; up to $280.5 million in development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments; and tiered royalties in the mid-single digits to low-double digits on sales of the HAT inhibiting compound throughout the world and on sales of the helicase inhibiting compound in all countries other than the United States. We will equally share profits and losses with Boehringer Ingelheim with respect to the helicase inhibiting compound in the United States. 
 Governance. We will work together with Boehringer Ingelheim through a joint steering committee to provide oversight over the research of the products during the research period, and oversight over the development and commercialization of the helicase inhibiting compound in the United States. 
 16


Exclusivity Provisions. Subject to exceptions specified in the agreement, neither we nor Boehringer Ingelheim may research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any product directed against the HAT or helicase targets that are the subject of the agreement, until a compound directed against the target that is developed under the agreement reaches a specified stage of development, other than pursuant to the agreement. 
 Opt out. We may opt-out of its participation in the development and commercialization of the joint product upon written notice to Boehringer Ingelheim, except under certain circumstances. 
 In the event that we elect to opt-out of the development and commercialization of the joint product or subject to a limited exception, detailed below, Boehringer Ingelheim elects to assume our development and commercialization rights with respect to the joint product in the United States following a change in control of our company, Boehringer Ingelheim will pay us tiered royalties in the mid-single digits to mid-teens, depending on the stage of development of the joint product at the time of such election, on sales of the joint product in the United States. 
 Following a change in control of our company, so long as the joint product has not reached a certain stage of development, Boehringer Ingelheim may, upon written notice to us, elect to assume our development and commercialization rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to the joint product in the United States and we will be deemed to have given Boehringer Ingelheim an opt-out notice. However, if Boehringer Ingelheim elects to assume our development and commercialization rights with respect to the joint product in the United States following a change in control of Epizyme that occurs after a certain stage of development with respect to the joint product, then the sharing of costs and profits may continue. 
 Term and Termination. Generally, the collaboration agreement remains in effect, on a product-by-product basis, until the last to expire royalty term for a product, but the collaboration agreement shall remain in effect with respect to the joint product in the United States until both parties mutually agree to cease commercialization of the joint product in the United States. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for cause following notice and a failure to cure by the defaulting party, if the other party initiates a patent challenge against the other party’s patents or if the other party becomes insolvent, and Boehringer Ingelheim may terminate the collaboration agreement without cause, subject to appropriate notice periods.
 Eisai 
 Overview. In March 2015, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai, under which we reacquired worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to our EZH2 program, including tazemetostat. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement, we will be responsible for global development, manufacturing and commercialization outside of Japan of tazemetostat and any other EZH2 product candidates, with Eisai retaining development and commercialization rights in Japan, as well as a right to elect to manufacture tazemetostat and any other EZH2 product candidates in Japan and waived the right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia. Under the original collaboration and license agreement, we had granted Eisai an exclusive worldwide license to our small molecule HMT inhibitors directed to EZH2, including tazemetostat, while retaining an opt-in right to co-develop, co-commercialize and share profits with Eisai as to licensed products in the United States. 
 Upon the execution of the amended and restated collaboration agreement in March 2015, we agreed to pay Eisai a $40.0 million upfront payment. We also agreed to pay Eisai up to $20.0 million in clinical development milestone payments, including a $10.0 million milestone payment upon the earlier of initiation of a first phase 3 clinical trial of any EZH2 product or the first submission of an NDA or Market Authorization Application, or MAA, up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestone payments, including a $25.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of the first NDA or MAA, and royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on worldwide net sales of any EZH2 product, excluding net sales in Japan. We are eligible to receive from Eisai royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on net sales of any EZH2 product in Japan. In 2019, we expect to trigger two $10.0 million milestone payments upon the submission of the NDAs for accelerated approval of tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma.  
 Under the original agreement, Eisai was solely responsible for funding all research, development and commercialization costs for licensed compounds. Under the amended agreement, we are solely responsible for funding global development, manufacturing and commercialization costs for EZH2 compounds outside of Japan, and Eisai is solely responsible for funding Japan-specific development and commercialization costs for EZH2 
 17


compounds. In connection with the amendment and restatement of our collaboration and license agreement with Eisai, we and Eisai agreed to the transition to us of ongoing development and manufacturing activities that were being conducted by or on behalf of Eisai. In January 2017, as part of Eisai’s obligations under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, Eisai enrolled and dosed the first patient in a Phase 1 study of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL in Japan, and waived the right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia.
 In the event that we are awarded a priority review voucher from the FDA with respect to an EZH2 product, Eisai is entitled to specified compensation if we use the voucher on a non-EZH2 program or sell the voucher to a third party. 
 Governance. Under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement, development will be guided by a joint steering committee, with Epizyme retaining final decision-making authority with respect to global development. 
 Exclusivity Restrictions. Subject to exceptions specified in the agreement, for an exclusivity period extending until eight years after the first commercial sale of a product covered by the agreement, neither we nor Eisai may research, develop or commercialize HMT inhibitors directed to EZH2, other than pursuant to the agreement. 
 Term and Termination. Our agreement with Eisai will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement with respect to all licensed products. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country commences on the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ends on the latest of expiration of specified patent coverage, expiration of specified regulatory exclusivity or ten years following the first commercial sale. We or Eisai may terminate the agreement for convenience as to our respective territories, upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The agreement will also terminate as to our territory if we cease all development and commercialization activities for the United States and specified major countries in Europe and as to Eisai’s territory if Eisai ceases all development and commercialization activities for Japan. The agreement may also be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or by us in the event Eisai, or an affiliate or sublicensee, participates or actively assists in an action or proceeding challenging or denying the validity of one of our patents. If we terminate the agreement for our convenience, the agreement terminates as a result of our cessation of development and commercialization activities or Eisai terminates the agreement for our uncured material breach, Eisai may elect to have worldwide development and commercialization rights revert to Eisai, and if Eisai so elects, Eisai will be required to pay us specified royalties on net sales of the licensed products and reimburse certain development expenses incurred by us. If Eisai terminates the agreement for its convenience, the agreement terminates as a result of Eisai’s cessation of development and commercialization activities or we terminate the agreement for Eisai’s uncured material breach or Eisai’s, or its affiliate’s or sublicensee’s, participation in, or assistance with, an action or proceeding challenging or denying the validity of one of our patents, Japanese development and commercialization rights to the licensed products revert to us, and we will be required to pay Eisai specified royalties on net sales of licensed products in Japan. 
LYSA 
 In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Lymphoma Academic Research Organization, or LYSARC, to conduct a combination trial of tazemetostat with R-CHOP. LYSARC is the operational arm of LYSA. This multi-center Phase 1b/2 study is evaluating tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP, as a first-line treatment in elderly, high-risk patients with DLBCL and is being sponsored by LYSARC. LYSA is managing the study operations for the trial, and we are recognizing our share of the related expenses as those costs are incurred over the duration of the trial. Primary endpoints in the trial include complete response rate, safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate and PFS. The study was initiated in December 2016 and data from the Phase 1b evaluation were presented by LYSA at the 2018 American Society of Hematology meeting showing that the combination of tazemetostat and the R-CHOP regimen was generally well-tolerated, confirmed the recommended tazemetostat dose for the combination to be 800 mg twice-daily, and demonstrated clinical activity, with 87 percent of patients experiencing a metabolic complete response. 
 18


Genentech 
 In June 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to conduct a Phase 1b clinical trial to investigate the anti-cancer effects of tazemetostat and Genentech’s atezolizumab, when used in combination. The trial will evaluate this combination regimen for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. This trial was initiated in December 2016. 
 In June 2017, we announced an expansion of our clinical collaboration with Genentech to investigate the combination of tazemetostat with atezolizumab in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic NSCLC. The trial was part of MORPHEUS, Genentech’s open-label, multi-center, randomized umbrella trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of multiple immunotherapy-based treatment combinations for metastatic NSCLC. This trial was initiated at the end of 2017, but before patients had been enrolled in the study, recruitment was halted due to the partial hold placed on tazemetostat studies. Due to the hold and strategic reprioritizations, in early 2019 the companies announced that they jointly opted not to move forward with the NSCLC combination study.
 Under the agreement, each company supplies its respective anti-cancer agent to support the trials and shares equally in the trial costs. Genentech is managing the study operations for the trial, and we are recognizing our share of the related expenses as those costs are incurred over the duration of the trial.
 Companion Diagnostics 
 Roche Molecular 
 In December 2012, Eisai and we entered into an agreement with Roche Molecular under which Eisai and we engaged Roche Molecular to develop a companion diagnostic to identify patients who possess certain activating mutations of EZH2. In October 2013, this agreement was amended to include additional mutations in EZH2. The development costs due under the amended agreement with Roche Molecular were the responsibility of Eisai until the execution of the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai in March 2015, at which time we assumed responsibility for the remaining development costs due under the agreement. In December 2015, we entered into a second amendment to the companion diagnostic agreement with Roche Molecular. The agreement was further amended in March 2018. Before the additional amendment, we were responsible for the remaining development costs of $10.5 million due under the agreement. Under the amended agreement, we are responsible for remaining development costs of $10.4 million due under the agreement and Eisai has agreed to reimburse us $0.9 million of this amount related to a regulatory milestone for Japan. We expect the remaining development costs under the amended agreement to be incurred and paid through 2020.
 Under our agreement with Roche Molecular, Roche Molecular is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to make commercially available the companion diagnostic. Roche Molecular has exclusive rights to commercialize the companion diagnostic. 
 Our agreement with Roche Molecular will expire when we are no longer developing or commercializing tazemetostat. We may terminate the agreement by giving Roche Molecular 90 days’ written notice if we discontinue development and commercialization of tazemetostat or determine, in conjunction with Roche Molecular, that the companion diagnostic is not needed for use with tazemetostat. Either we or Roche Molecular may also terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party, in the event of material changes in circumstances that are contrary to key assumptions specified in the agreement or in the event of specified bankruptcy or similar circumstances. Under specified termination circumstances, Roche Molecular may become entitled to specified termination fees. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary compounds and technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies, diagnostics and other inventions. Our patent portfolio is currently composed of over 250 issued patents and allowed patent applications and over 525 pending patent applications in the major pharmaceutical markets, that we own as well as license from other parties. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 19


Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of HMTs, as well as to develop a proprietary position for new target classes, such as histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional CMP and HMT inhibitor compounds and their derivatives, and to other new target classes. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies. 
 The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 
 EZH2. Our EZH2 patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent No. 8,410,088 covering the composition of matter of tazemetostat. This patent issued on April 2, 2013 and is expected to expire in 2032, not including extensions. Our EZH2 portfolio also includes 38 additional U.S. patents and more than 200 foreign patents, expected to expire between 2031 and 2035, not including extensions. The claims of these patents cover the composition of matter of EZH2 inhibitor compounds and various methods of their making and use. Patent applications in the same families as these patents are pending in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. The EZH2 program portfolio encompasses more than 35 patent families with pending patent applications relating to compositions of matter and methods of making and use of EZH2 inhibitors. The patent families in this portfolio are in various stages of prosecution and include patent applications filed in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States; Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. Our patent applications in the EZH2 portfolio, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2031 and 2038, not including extensions. 
 DOT1L. Our DOT1L patent portfolio includes U.S. Patent No. 8,580,762 covering the composition of matter of pinometostat. The patent issued on November 12, 2013 and is expected to expire in 2032, not including extensions. Our DOT1L portfolio also includes 13 additional U.S. patents and more than 45 foreign patents, expected to expire between 2031 and 2034, not including extensions. The DOT1L program portfolio encompasses more than fifteen patent families relating to compositions of matter of DOT1L inhibitor compounds and methods of their making and use. The patent families in this portfolio are in various stages of prosecution and include patent families with applications filed in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions including the United States; and PCT applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. These patents and patent applications are wholly owned by us. Our patent applications in the DOT1L portfolio, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2031 and 2036, not including extensions. 
 EHMT2. Our EHMT2 patent portfolio includes more than eight patent families directed to various product candidates and methods of use, with applications filed in the United States and internationally. The portfolio includes PCT applications that are eligible for filing in most jurisdictions worldwide, and U.S. provisional applications that may be used as the basis for non-provisional U.S. and international applications. Patents, if issued from currently pending applications in the EHMT2 portfolio are expected to expire between 2037 and 2039.
 Other Targets. We also have patent portfolios directed to targets other than EZH2, DOT1L, and EHMT2, including the HMT targets PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1 (also known as PRMT4), PRMT5, PRMT6, PRMT8, SMYD2 and SMYD3. These patent portfolios have more than 40 patent families directed to various product candidates with applications filed in the United States, PCT applications that are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States, and U.S. provisional applications that may be used to establish non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. Patents, if issued in these portfolios are expected to expire between 2033 and 2039. We have 18 granted US patents that cover PRMT5 inhibitors and their methods of use. These patents are expected to expire in 2033, not including extensions.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities and currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical development, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We have entered into clinical supply agreements with contract manufacturers for all products we have in clinical development, including tazemetostat, pinometostat, and EZM8266. 
 All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in third-party facilities that are equipped, staffed, and experienced in the manufacture of such pharmaceutical products. All such facilities have successful track-records manufacturing products for the US, EU, and ROW markets, meeting regulatory and compliance requirements as appropriate. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 We rely on third parties for the manufacture of any diagnostics we may need or if required. We are currently collaborating with Roche Molecular for a diagnostic for its potential use with tazemetostat, and we expect to rely on Roche Molecular for the manufacture of the diagnostic it is developing. We may enter into similar agreements for the manufacture of other diagnostics. 
 Commercialization 
 We have recently begun to establish a commercial infrastructure in preparation for a potential future launch of tazemetostat and other product candidates that may receive marketing approval. We have retained commercial rights in the United States to all of our product candidates for which we may receive marketing approvals, except for two programs that are the subject of our collaboration with GSK, two of the preclinical programs that are the subject of our collaboration with Celgene, and the preclinical histone acetyltransferase inhibitor program that is the subject of 
 21


our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. For the preclinical helicase inhibitor program, we will share U.S. commercialization responsibilities with Boehringer Ingelheim, with Boehringer Ingelheim assuming responsibility for commercialization outside of the U.S. We plan to retain commercialization rights in the United States and possibly in select foreign jurisdictions in connection with any future collaborations. We intend to build a focused field presence and marketing capabilities to commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval in the United States, as well as the capabilities to lead global commercial strategy.
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building an organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the hematologists and oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our clinical stage product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we may choose to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval, or may choose to commercialize our products in certain markets, depending upon many factors, including the target market size, availability of reimbursement, and our financial resources at the time. 
 We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan. We intend to build a focused field presence and marketing capabilities to commercialize tazemetostat for the epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma indications in the United States. We have begun building the infrastructure necessary to support the launch and marketing of tazemetostat for epithelioid sarcoma, and believe we can adequately address this patient population through a modest field force of less than 25 professionals. For geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to reaching patients, including through potential collaborations.
 We expect that our collaborators for any companion diagnostics we may develop in the future for use with our therapeutic products will hold the commercial rights to these diagnostic products, as is the case for our collaboration with Roche Molecular. We expect to coordinate closely with any diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of any related therapeutic products. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Companies that are developing new epigenetic treatments for cancer that target histone methyltransferases, or HMTs, and protein arginine methyltransferases, or PRMTs, include GSK, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and Constellation Pharmaceuticals. Further, companies which are known to have EZH2 inhibitor programs or related programs include: Constellation Pharmaceuticals, developing an EZH2 inhibitor (CPI-1205, Phase 1/2 castration-resistant prostate cancer, solid tumors), Novartis AG, developing an EED inhibitor which indirectly blocks EZH2 (MAK683, Phase 1/2, advanced malignancies), Daiichi Sankyo, developing a EZH1/EZH2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat, DS-3201, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas, AML, and ALL), and Pfizer, developing EZH2 inhibitor PF-06821497, Phase 1, relapsed or refractory SCLC, castration-resistant prostate cancer, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapeutics that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs, and some, including Celgene, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, and Eisai, are now marketing cancer treatments that work by targeting epigenetic mechanisms other than HMTs. 
 22


Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 Tazemetostat. The most common treatments for FL are chemotherapies, usually combined with the monoclonal antibody Rituxan, or more recently, in the case of FL, Gazyva, which is a next-generation antibody that acts against the same target as Rituxan, CD20. While Rituxan and a number of other widely used anti-cancer agents are labeled either broadly for NHL, no therapies are approved specifically for the treatment of tumors associated with EZH2 activating mutations. There are a number of companies currently evaluating investigational agents in the relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma patient setting.
 No therapies are approved specifically for the treatment of INI1- and SMARCA4-negative tumors. Epithelioid sarcoma, an INI1-negative tumor, is typically treated with surgical resection when it presents as localized disease. When epithelioid sarcoma recurs or metastasizes, it may be treated with systemic chemotherapy or investigational agents since there are no approved systemic therapies specifically indicated for this disease. To the best of our knowledge there are no competitive products in development for epithelioid sarcoma.

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, record-keeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, pricing, reimbursement, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. It is the responsibility of the company seeking to market a drug to test it and submit evidence that the drug is safe and effective. The failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing of the drug in compliance with the FDA’s GMP regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees per published Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines for that year, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | commitment to comply with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirements, to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and an IND. Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is an 
 24


exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after submission and receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold or partial hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the candidate 
drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the investigational 
drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the candidate drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In Phase 4, post-approval studies may be conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 In general, the FDA accepts foreign safety and efficacy studies that were not conducted under an IND provided that they are well designed, well conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conducted in accordance with ethical principles acceptable to the international community. The conduct of these studies must meet at least minimum standards for assuring human subject protection. Therefore, for studies submitted in support of an NDA that were conducted outside the United States and not under an IND, the agency requires demonstration that such studies were conducted in accordance with GCP. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use. 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. 
 25


FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established, and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended, a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 Marketing Approval. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most applications are subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan drug designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation. 
 26


The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, or other clinical development programs.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 Under PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review 
and disposition of an application. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA has the option to refer questions regarding their review of a marketing application for a New Molecular Entity, or NME, to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA uses approximately 50 advisory committees and panels to obtain independent expert advice on scientific, technical, and policy matters. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and perform a sponsor-monitor audit if an audit has not been completed in the previous two years. 
 The product development testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. As a result, the FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. 
 27


Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug (including a biologic) intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or biologics license application, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives. For example, a 
marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than for the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Furthermore, federal law establishes certain tax credits designed to encourage the development of orphan drugs. With passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, that tax credit was halved from 50% to 25%. The granting of an orphan drug designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. 
 Breakthrough Drug Designation. FDA may grant breakthrough drug designation to a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval. 
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs. The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and Breakthrough Designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA regarding drug development and may submit sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA on a rolling basis before the entire application is complete. 
 28


The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of well-conducted clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to perform post-marketing confirmatory study(ies) to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. Although a drug may be designated as “breakthrough” or “fast track”, the determination of accelerated approval is based on the clinical endpoint and not on the expeditious manner in which it is being developed. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics. Safe and effective use of a drug may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that we believe will be more likely to respond to the product. FDA officials have issued guidance that addresses issues critical to developing in vitro companion diagnostics, such as when the FDA will require that the diagnostic and the drug be approved simultaneously. The guidance issued in August 2014 states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. 
 The FDA requires that devices, or in vitro companion diagnostics, intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the guidance, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety. 
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. 
PMA applications are subject to an application fee: for federal fiscal year 2019, the standard fee for review of a PMA is $322,147 and the small business fee is $80,537. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers 
are required to 
comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 29


Post-Approval Commitments and Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted 
only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label 
uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label 
uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. 
 30


In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 
 The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 31


We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 In addition, federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures 
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement. The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates and any related companion diagnostics. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
 32


Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, PPACA, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33


 
• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 became law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved 
product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law.
 With enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.
 
The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of 
 34


pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension. A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 35


Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
 Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 A 505(b)(2) application applies to a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” As with an ANDA, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 36


Hatch—Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review 
a drug 
application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to 
the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, a drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will also not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication 
is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 We intend to seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for our products whenever it is available. We have been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union for pinometostat, and orphan drug designation in the United States for tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with FL, MRT, soft tissue sarcoma and mesothelioma.  
 Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan drug exclusivity periods described above, and any listed patent. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent 
 37


protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.
 The 21st Century Cures Act. On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research.  It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research.  Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies.  To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain 
drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires the FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes the FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations. 
 European Union Drug Approval Process 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the EU. Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directives, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation, and will become applicable no earlier than 2020. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 
 38


Marketing Authorization. To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, and optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. For the EMA, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting an MAA for use for drugs in pediatric populations. 
 Data and Market Exclusivity. In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from assessing a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete human clinical trial database and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
General Data Protection Regulation. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 39


Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing authorization and 10 years of market exclusivity following drug approval. Fee reductions are not limited to the first year after authorization for small and medium enterprises. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Priority Medicines, or PRIME, Drug Designation. EMA may grant prime drug designation to medicine developers to treat an unmet medical need upon selection. Medicines eligible for PRIME must address an unmet medical need, have data available showing the potential to address this need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients, and provide early and enhanced support to optimize the development of eligible medicines speed up their evaluation and contribute to timely patients’ access. Once a candidate is selected for PRIME designation the EMA will provide scientific advice at key development milestones and confirm potential for accelerated assessment at the time of an application for marketing authorization. These medicines are considered priority medicines by EMA.  
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom. On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, which is commonly referred to as Brexit. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the European Union. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the European Union, then it is expected the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
