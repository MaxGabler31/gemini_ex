 Item 1. Business.
 Our Company
 Overview
 AquaVenture Holdings Limited is a multinational provider of Water‑as‑a‑Service®, or WAAS®, solutions that provide our customers with a reliable and cost‑effective source of clean drinking water, processed water and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions primarily under long‑term contracts that minimize capital investment by the customer. We believe our WAAS business model offers a differentiated value proposition that generates long‑term customer relationships, recurring revenue, predictable cash flow and attractive rates of return. We generate revenue from our operations in North America, the Caribbean and South America, and are pursuing expansion opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets.
 We deliver our WAAS solutions through two operating platforms: Seven Seas Water and Quench. Seven Seas Water is a multinational provider of desalination, wastewater treatment, and water reuse solutions to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our desalination solutions provide more than 8.5 billion gallons per year of potable, high purity industrial grade and ultra‑pure water (which is water that is treated to meet higher purity standards required for industrial, semiconductor, utility or pharmaceutical applications). Our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, which include plants ranging in capacity from 5,000 gallons per day, or GPD, to more than 1.5 million GPD, are provided through more than 80 leases with customers. Quench is a U.S.‑based provider of Point‑of‑Use, or POU, filtered water systems and related services through direct and indirect sales channels. Through its direct sales channel, Quench primarily rents and services POU units to approximately 50,000 institutional and commercial customers in the United States and Canada, including more than half of the Fortune 500. Quench’s typical initial rental contract is three years in duration and contains an automatic renewal provision.  Our annual unit attrition rate, at December 31, 2018, was approximately 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. We define “annual unit attrition rate” as a ratio, the numerator of which is the total number of removals of company‑owned and billed rental units during the trailing 12‑month period, and the denominator of which is the average number of company‑owned and billed rental units during the same 12‑month period. Through our indirect sales channel, we provide POU systems, filters, parts and services to networks of approximately 250 dealers and retailers predominantly in North America.

 We are led by a talented management team with extensive industry experience, engineering knowledge, operational expertise and financial expertise and leverage our operating and engineering expertise to develop and deliver highly reliable WAAS solutions by applying proven water purification and wastewater technologies. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on global growth opportunities driven by population growth, increasing urbanization and water scarcity, increasing focus on health and wellness, wastewater treatment and solutions, and the environmental impact of bottled water consumption. We believe our focus on delivering best‑in‑class service and efficiency to our customers will continue to lead to substantial new business, contract extensions and customer expansion opportunities. In addition, we also have a demonstrated track record of identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions, with Seven Seas Water and Quench having completed 29 transactions from 2007 through 2018. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that will expand our geographic presence, broaden our service offerings and allow us to move into additional markets.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 665 employees.
 Corporate Reorganization & Initial Public Offering
 On October 5, 2016, our initial public offering, or IPO, was declared effective and on October 12, 2016, we completed the sale of 7,475,000 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $118.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
 Prior to our IPO, we completed a series of reorganization transactions, which we refer to as the Corporate Reorganization. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about the above-mentioned transactions.
 Seven Seas Water
 Our Seven Seas Water operating platform offers WAAS solutions by providing outsourced desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions for governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers. Our desalination solutions utilize seawater reverse osmosis, or SWRO, and other purification technologies to produce potable and high purity industrial process water in high volumes for customers operating in regions with limited access to potable water. Our wastewater treatment and water reuse products and solutions include scalable modular treatment plants, field-erected treatment plants and temporary bypass plants that are used by our customers to treat and convert wastewater into effluent or reclaimed water prior to being released back into the environment. Desalination Solutions
 For our desalination solutions, we either design, build and operate our desalination plants or acquire, refurbish and expand existing desalination plants. We assume responsibility for operating and maintaining the plants, including procuring all required equipment and supplies. In exchange, we typically enter into long‑term agreements to sell to our customers agreed‑upon quantities of water that meet specified quality standards for a contracted period, for which we are paid based on actual or minimum required unit consumption. We typically enter into contracts with a term of 10 to 20 years, except in situations in which emergency water is needed or we assume an existing contract from an existing owner or operator. With this approach, our customers benefit from a highly reliable, long‑term clean water supply with predictable pricing, low customer capital investment and outsourced management of operations and maintenance. 
 We offer customized solutions, often implemented using containerized or modular equipment, which allows us to quickly commission, expand, curtail or move production capacity. We design, procure and engineer systems to meet the customer’s specific requirements with regard to source water conditions and specific water quality and quantity needs. Once a plant commences operations, customer water demand typically increases over time, often leading to plant expansion and contract extension opportunities. We also offer quick deployment solutions to address emergency water shortages, such as those caused by natural disasters or failure and/or overburdening of existing water production infrastructure, and water reuse solutions for industrial users seeking to reuse and/or minimize wastewater.
 We are a leading provider of water to the Caribbean market, where we are currently the primary supplier to the United States Virgin Islands, or the USVI, St. Maarten and the British Virgin Islands, or the BVI. We also maintain significant plant operations in Trinidad, Curaçao and Peru. We currently operate eleven water treatment facilities in the 

 
  3

 
Caribbean region and South America producing more than 8.5 billion gallons of purified water per year under long‑term contracts.

We expect to grow our Seven Seas Water business by expanding existing operations as customer demand increases and by selectively entering underserved markets through both new project development and acquisitions. We believe that there are a large number of medium‑scale desalination plants (which we define as plants with approximately 2 million GPD to 13 million GPD of output capacity) in operation globally that could benefit from our ownership and operating expertise. Leveraging our strength in the Caribbean market and our reputation for reliability, quality and operating efficiency, we are pursuing new opportunities in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets. 

Own, Operate and Maintain
 Providing WAAS solutions to our customers is central to our desalination solution. We typically own, operate and maintain the desalination plants and sell water to our customers pursuant to long‑term contracts. We either design, build and operate our desalination plants or acquire, refurbish and expand existing desalination plants. We assume responsibility for operating and maintaining the plants, including procuring all required equipment and supplies. We typically design our desalination plants to exceed contractually required production capacity to ensure reliability, enable expansion to meet increased demand and to have more predictable lifecycle costs. In building our plants, we often use containerized units and modular skids with preconstructed components of the plant, which enables us to commission a plant and commence production more quickly. We also use standardized designs and equipment which help us operate and maintain our plants more efficiently and cost‑effectively and simplify spare parts management.
 Under our WAAS business model, we manage the entire lifecycle of a desalination plant on an outsourced basis for our customers. Typically, a customer commits to purchase water at a fixed price per gallon, subject to adjustment based on a specified index, which meets agreed upon quality standards. Certain of our contracts require customers to purchase a minimum volume of water on a take‑or‑pay basis, and in some cases, we satisfy a customer’s water requirements by utilizing our plants as its exclusive water producer. Our water purchase agreements typically provide for initial terms of up to 20 years. However, customers may ask us to increase the capacity of plants or to build additional plants to satisfy increased demand for the reliable, high-quality water we produce. In those cases where customers ask us to expand the capacity of the plants, we typically extend the term of the initial contract and reduce the unit cost that the customer pays. The facilities in our portfolio are both operated and maintained, as needed, by Seven Seas Water employees. To ensure we continue to provide reliable and high-quality water, while remaining efficient and cost-effective, we monitor the plants we operate, both remotely and on site.
 For our water supply agreements where we build, own and operate, we generally have the right to decommission and remove our desalination plants upon the expiration or termination of the term of the water supply agreement. Certain of our water supply agreements, however, provide for the transfer of the plant to our customer either at the end of the term of the agreement, upon the termination of the agreement or upon exercise of contractual buyout rights.  The purchase prices payable upon exercise of the buyout rights are specified in the agreement and may be either fixed or variable based on factors set forth in the agreement. Our plants are generally built on property leased from the customer or its related parties pursuant to leases with terms that typically extend longer than the water purchase agreement, so that we may decommission and remove the plant.

  Trinidad
 We built and own and operate a desalination plant currently with a design capacity of 6.7 million GPD located at Point Fortin, Trinidad. Under the terms of the water sale agreement with the Water & Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, which we refer to as the Trinidad Water Sale Agreement, we are required to provide a minimum supply of water each month equal to a certain percentage of the design capacity of the plant, and Water & Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, or WASA, is required to purchase all of the water we produce each month up to a certain percentage of the design capacity of the plant. If production levels fall below agreed upon contractual minimums, then the water payment owed by WASA to us is reduced. On September 3, 2015, we entered into a fourth amendment to expand the existing desalination plant capacity by approximately 21% and extend the initial term of the agreement, which was set to expire in 2026, by 50 months. This expansion was completed in July 2016 and added 1.2 million GPD of capacity to the plant.
 The Trinidad Water Sale Agreement may be terminated upon default. If WASA terminates the Agreement early or is in default, a penalty that is based on estimated future production of the plant will be imposed. Upon termination, we have 120 days to remove our equipment from the site.
 Under the Trinidad Water Sale Agreement, WASA is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plant at no charge to us. We are not responsible for loss of production arising from a disruption to our electrical supply or a change in the quality or quantity of feedwater.
 We sublease the site where the Point Fortin plant is located from WASA, which leases the site from Petrotrin, a state‑owned oil company. The term of the lease, as extended, expires in June 2030.
 United States Virgin Islands
 We built and currently own and operate three principal desalination plants in the USVI with an aggregate design capacity of 7.7 million GPD.
 We sell the water produced at our Richmond Generation Plant on St. Croix and our Randolph Harley Generation Plant on St. Thomas on an as‑demanded basis to the Water & Power Authority of the United States Virgin Islands, or VIWAPA, pursuant to a series of water purchase agreements entered into with VIWAPA, which we refer to as the USVI Water Purchase Agreements, the current terms of which expire in 2033. Although the USVI Water Purchase Agreements do not specify a minimum consumption level, they stipulate that Seven Seas Water will be VIWAPA’s exclusive supplier. The current design capacity of our Richmond Generation Plant and the Randolph Harley Generation 

 
  5

 
Plant are 3.7 million GPD and 3.3 million GPD, respectively. Under the USVI Water Purchase Agreements, VIWAPA is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plants at no charge to us, provided that our electrical consumption per thousand gallons of water produced does not exceed certain thresholds. If our electrical consumption exceeds such thresholds, we are required to reimburse VIWAPA at VIWAPA’s then current electricity production cost, subject to adjustment for feedwater quality. We lease the sites where these plants are located from VIWAPA. The leases terminate 180 days after the contract expiration dates to enable us to remove our equipment.
 In addition, we built and currently own and operate a desalination plant with the design capacity of 0.7 million GPD on St. Croix. We sell the water produced by this plant under a water sales agreement to support a storage terminal, refinery and marine facility owned by Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC. We sell the water produced at this plant on a take‑or‑pay basis. Pursuant to an amendment in July 2016, the term of the agreement with Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC was extended to December 2021. 
 Curaçao
 We own and operate a desalination facility in Curaçao with an aggregate design capacity of 4.9 million GPD. We sell the industrial quality water produced at this facility on a take‑or‑pay basis to Curaçao Refinery Utilities Company B.V., a government owned utility that provides utility services to a refinery it has leased to Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, a state‑owned oil company of Venezuela. The current term of this water sales agreement expires in 2019, but will extend to 2022 if our customer extends the lease of the refinery to PDVSA. Under this water sales agreement, our customer is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plant at no charge to us. We lease the site where this facility is located. Although the contract expires in 2019, we are in active discussions with the customer to continue this relationship. St. Maarten
 We own and operate three desalination plants with an aggregate design capacity of 5.8 million GPD in St. Maarten. We built two of these plants and acquired and refurbished the third. We sell the water produced at these plants on a take‑or‑pay basis to the Government of St. Maarten pursuant to the St. Maarten Water Purchase Agreements.  Pursuant to an amendment in April 2018, the required minimum monthly water purchase by our customer was reduced, in exchange for a four-year extension to the water contract which will now expire in 2025. The reduction in the required minimum monthly water purchase will remain in effect for three years, at which time the average monthly minimum purchase will then revert to previous minimum requirements for the remainder of the contract. Our customer has the option to extend the lower minimum volumes for an additional two years, which, if exercised, would also extend the contract expiry from 2025 to 2027. Under the St. Maarten Water Purchase Agreements, we are obligated to pay for the electricity needed to operate our plant at a fixed rate. We lease the sites where these plants are located. The St. Maarten Water Purchase Agreements require us to transfer ownership of the plants to the government upon the expiration of the water purchase agreements and under other certain circumstances. British Virgin Islands
 In June 2015, we purchased the capital stock of Biwater Holdings, a subsidiary of which owns and operates a desalination plant with the design capacity of 2.8 million GPD located on Tortola, BVI. We sell the water produced at this plant on a take‑or‑pay basis to the government of the BVI pursuant to a water purchase agreement, the current term of which expires in 2030. Under this water purchase agreement, our customer is obligated to provide the electricity needed to operate our plant at no charge to us. We lease the site where this plant is located. We are required to transfer ownership of the plant to the government of the BVI upon the expiration of the water purchase agreement and upon the termination of the agreement under certain other circumstances. On August 4, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the water purchase agreement with the government of the BVI to modify, effective January 1, 2017, certain contractual provisions related to the calculation of the water rate and the overall cash payment profile in exchange for other actions between us and the customer. All other terms of the original water purchase agreement remained unchanged. Peru
 In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Aguas de Bayovar S.A.C., or ADB, and all the rights and obligations under a design and construction contract for a desalination plant and related infrastructure located in Peru (the “Peru Acquisition”).  We sell both seawater and desalinated process water on a take-

 
  6

 
or-pay basis to Compañia Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L under an operating and maintenance agreement. Compañia Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L uses the water to operate its Bayovar phosphate mine, which is located in North Western Peru. The desalination plant and related infrastructure have the capacity to deliver more than 7.9 million GPD of seawater to the mine via a 24-mile pipeline and 2.7 million GPD of desalinated process water from a SWRO facility located at the mine site. The current term of the operating and maintenance agreement expires in 2037. The plant is constructed on property controlled by Compañia Minera Miski Mayo S.R.L, which owns the plant and related infrastructure. The rights to the design and construction contract include monthly installment payments for the construction of the desalination plant and related infrastructure, which are guaranteed by a former shareholder of our customer and continue until 2024. These payments are accounted for as a note receivable.
 Other Plants
 We own and operate a desalination plant with the design capacity of 1.0 million GPD on the Island of Great Exuma, The Bahamas. We acquired the facility in 2009 and refurbished it in 2013. We sell the water produced at this plant on a take‑or‑pay basis to Clearview Enterprises Limited, which is part of the Sandals Group. The current terms of these agreements expire in 2019. We lease the site where the desalination plant is located from our customer. Although the contract expires in 2019, we are negotiating with the customer to continue this relationship.
 We own and operate a desalination plant with the design capacity of 0.5 million GPD in Anguilla, which we began operating in October 2018. We sell the water produced by this plant to one customer.
 We own and operate two desalination plants with the design capacity of an aggregate of 500,000 GPD on Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands. We built one of these plants and acquired and refurbished the other. We sell the water produced at these plants to local customers and own the sites where these plants are located. 
 Wastewater Treatment and Water Reuse Solutions

For our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we design, fabricate and install plants that are leased under a contractual term or sold to customers.  The wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions offered to customers include scalable modular treatment plants, field-erected plants and temporary bypass plants ranging from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD.  

The modular wastewater treatment plant is a scalable design that can be expanded to meet increases in customer demand. An example of this would be a residential property developer that needs a wastewater treatment plant for its development. As each new phase of the property development is completed, the wastewater processing demand increases with the addition of new homes. Additional modules can be added to the waste processing plant to meet this increased processing demand. Field-erected treatment plants are similar to the modular plants, including the customers they serve, with the main difference being that they are generally larger in size. The third solution offered is temporary bypass plants. These temporary transportable plants are deployed to maintain continuity of treatment services when a customer’s centralized wastewater treatment plant is not operating to enable significant maintenance or repair.

The contractual term for our modular and field-erected wastewater treatment and water reuse plants leased to customers typically range from three to five years while our temporary bypass solutions are leased under short-term contracts of less than one year. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 80 leases of wastewater treatment and water reuse plants with our customers. Plants sold to the customer are designed, fabricated and installed typically over a period of typically 6 to 12 months. While operations and maintenance of the plants are typically the responsibility of the customer, we do perform these services, in limited instances, for the customer.

We currently offer our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions in North America, including Texas where we believe we are a leading provider for modular and field-erected designs, and the Caribbean where we operate and maintain certain plants owned by certain of our desalination solution customers.        Customers
 Customers for our desalination solutions generally fall into three categories: (i) municipal customers or government‑owned utility companies, (ii) industrial, power, refining, mining and/or other manufacturing companies 

 
  7

 
which require a reliable source of industrial quality water for their operations, or (iii) resorts and/or private entities. These customers may (a) contract with us to build and operate plants, (b) become our customers after their initial plant owner or operator sells its interest in a plant or (c) become our customer after replacing an operator with Seven Seas Water. Our important target market opportunities include municipal customers or government owned utility companies that wish to contract to have a plant constructed to increase water production for residential or industrial purposes or seek our experience in operating an existing plant. Under these arrangements, the municipal customers or government owned utility company is typically responsible for distributing water, providing power and a minimum purchase guarantee. Another target market is industrial customers that require clean water for an industrial purpose. Historically, prospective industrial customers generated their own water, but increasingly more industrial users have outsourced the production of water to focus on their core competencies.
 Customers for our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions generally include property developer and municipal customers, including utility districts. These customers may contract with us to build a plant and often add more of our solutions as their property is further developed. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues earned from our customer in Trinidad represented approximately 10% of our total consolidated revenues. 
 Business Development
 Our Seven Seas Water platform focuses on desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions opportunities. 
 For our desalination solutions, we focus on opportunities to own and operate desalination plants designed to produce approximately 2 million GPD to 13 million GPD of water for governmental, municipal, industrial and hospitality customers, a relatively underserved sub‑segment of the desalination market with limited comparable solutions and competitors. We pursue these opportunities by participating in request for proposal processes, developing plans for plants in underserved areas, acquiring existing plants and providing emergency water services. Geographically, we continue to pursue opportunities to expand in the Caribbean region, while seeking opportunities in North America, South America, Africa, the Middle East and other select markets.
 For our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, we focus on leasing equipment for a contractual term or selling equipment to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial and property developer customers.  The wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions offered to customers include scalable modular treatment plants, field-erected plants and temporary bypass plants ranging from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD. We pursue opportunities throughout North America, including Texas where we believe we are a leading provider for modular and field-erected designs, and the Caribbean.
 We believe our desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions are complementary and can result in cross selling opportunities to customers. 
 Our business development function is organized into teams dedicated to pursuing opportunities in specific target markets. Company personnel focused on the North American, Caribbean, African and Middle Eastern markets operate primarily from our Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas offices. Our South America team operates from Santiago, Chile, where we have been focused on developing business opportunities for the Seven Seas Water business in South America. 
 As part of our expansion strategy, we may acquire additional desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse plants or businesses. Potential acquisition candidates include individual plants and businesses that operate multiple plants. We frequently evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate any acquired plants or businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy. 
 We also pursue opportunities to deploy our mobile containerized desalination solutions and our bypass wastewater treatment solutions to help parties address short-term or immediate needs. To address this business opportunity, we maintain a fleet of mobile containerized plants and bypass wastewater treatment solutions. Our ability to 

 
  8

 
quickly deploy, commission and commence operation of these plants and solutions provides us a competitive advantage in these situations. We provide these rapid deploy services pursuant to contracts that typically have terms that range from less than one year up to five years. By assisting customers with their short-term or immediate needs, we are often well positioned to expand such customer relationships into long‑term arrangements.
 Competition
 For our desalination solutions, Seven Seas Water generally targets projects for medium‑scale plants that it can own and operate that are accompanied by long‑term contracts to sell water to customers. We compete primarily on the basis of the unit price at which water is sold to our customers, as well as our ability to build, commission, operate and maintain our plants to provide customers with a reliable long‑term water supply. Our pricing depends on many factors, including the length of the water supply agreement term, the volume of water to be supplied, factors relating to the feedwater quality and location of the plant, infrastructure availability, electric power availability and costs (including who is responsible for paying those costs), and our cost of capital, among other factors. 
 The competitors in our market generally fall into three categories: (i) engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, companies, (ii) large project developers, and (iii) other outsourced service model companies. EPC companies, which contract to build plants that satisfy specific requirements, often do not operate such plants after completion. Large project developers focus on large‑scale municipal desalination projects and prefer to take the role as lead developer for a customer sponsor and often do not operate plants after completion. Many of these companies, among others, currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our desalination business. Many of these companies already maintain worldwide operations and have greater financial, managerial and other resources than we do. We believe that our low overhead costs, knowledge of local markets and our efficient manner of operating desalination water production equipment will provide us a competitive advantage in many medium scale applications and projects. 
 For our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions, Seven Seas Water generally targets plants ranging from 5,000 GPD to more than 1.5 million GPD delivered to the customer through capital and financed equipment sales, and leasing arrangements. Further, our modular wastewater treatment plants provide customers with the ability to scale their plants based on demand. While we compete directly with other regional, national and international companies, many of our competitors do not offer similar modular design, financing or leasing solutions that we believe our core markets demand.
 Quench
 Our Quench business offers WAAS solutions by providing bottleless filtered water coolers and other products that use filtered water as an input, such as ice machines, sparkling water dispensers and coffee brewers, to customers throughout the United States and Canada. Our POU systems purify a customer’s existing water supply, offering a cost‑effective, convenient, and environmentally‑friendly alternative to traditional bottled water coolers, or BWC. We offer our solutions to a broad mix of industries, including government, education, medical, manufacturing, retail and hospitality, among others. 
 Through our direct sales channel, we install and maintain our filtered water systems in exchange for a monthly rental fee, typically under multi‑year contracts that renew automatically. With an installed base of more than 140,000 company‑owned rental systems, we believe that we are one of the largest POU‑focused water services companies operating in North America. We are able to service our rental customers across the United States and Canada, with Quench employee service technicians covering more than 300 metropolitan statistical areas, as defined in the 2010 U.S. Census and the 2016 Canadian Census. We generate sales by leveraging our team of field and inside sales representatives, supported by a marketing team with expertise in digital and traditional media. We believe the geographic scale of our platform, the diversity of product offering, and our customer-centric service provide us a competitive advantage. These capabilities also help to create customer loyalty and preserve our market share.
 Through our indirect sales channel, we offer POU systems to networks of approximately 250 dealers and retailers predominantly in North America. The indirect sales channel expands our participation in the growing POU market domestically and internationally. In addition, this channel enhances our ability to develop, source and manufacture innovative, exclusive, bottleless filtered water coolers and related offerings. Lastly, the channel offers us the opportunity to develop deep relationships with POU dealers that could potentially lead to future acquisitions.

 Products
 Our filtered water systems offer customers a cost‑effective, convenient and environmentally‑friendly alternative to traditional BWCs. Our systems are connected to a customer’s existing water supply, which is filtered at the point of use to reduce impurities and other contaminants. Once a POU system is installed, ongoing service requirements, including routine maintenance, repair and filter changes, are typically covered under a rental agreement for our rental customers.
 We offer our customers filtered water systems with varying capacities to serve low, medium and high usage environments, which are available in floor‑standing, countertop, under‑counter and under‑sink model forms. Our systems offer a variety of water dispensing options, including hot, cold, ambient and sparkling water. These systems are also available with various features, such as hands‑free dispensing, anti‑microbial surfaces and leak detection. Depending on the customer’s purification requirements, Quench systems can employ various technologies such as carbon filtration, reverse osmosis filtration, deionization and ultraviolet sanitization.
 In addition, we offer a line of ice machines and commercial coffee brewers, both of which utilize our water filtration systems. To our coffee brewer customers, we also offer a selection of coffees, teas and other break room supplies. 
 Our filtered water systems and related equipment are sourced both internally from our company-owned manufacturing facility in South Korea, and externally from a variety of domestic and international manufacturers. We also refurbish rental equipment that is returned from customer locations for future redeployment. We intend to continue working with our suppliers and leveraging our market knowledge to refine our water cooler product offerings and our other related water‑enabled products, such as ice machines, sparkling water systems and coffee brewers. Some of our recent acquisitions have provided manufacturing operations and expertise and exclusive sourcing agreements, which enhance our ability to develop and source new and innovative POU products. 

We provide our rental services generally under automatically‑renewing contracts with a typical initial term of three years, however these contracts can range from month‑to‑month to four years. Our annual unit attrition rate, at December 31, 2018, was approximately 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years. In these rental agreements, we bear the up‑front cost of purchasing and installing systems as well as the ongoing cost of maintaining them in exchange for a recurring fee. In certain circumstances, we sell water filtration systems to end customers, which may be accompanied by a maintenance contract or serviced on a time-and-materials basis. In 2017, we began selling certain water filtration systems exclusively through our indirect sales channel of POU dealers and retailers. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We market our products and services through a variety of digital and traditional methods. Digital marketing activities include search engine marketing, email marketing, affiliate marketing and display advertising. Traditional marketing activities include telemarketing and trade shows. Marketing messages emphasize the benefits of water filtration versus those of delivered water, which include convenience, reliability of supply, cost savings, wellness and environmental sustainability. According to a 2016 study by Zenith International, or Zenith, POU system penetration in 2015 was 11.1% of the U.S. commercial water cooler market, by revenue, which we believe provides a significant opportunity for additional organic growth.
 We have a team of Quench sales and marketing professionals dedicated to new customer acquisition activities across the United States and Canada. Our field sales representatives are focused on increasing penetration in the largest metropolitan markets in the United States and Canada. We also have specialized sales teams focused on large enterprises and specific industries to expand our market penetration. We maintain a presence in online advertising and lead generation, supported by an in‑house team of digital marketing personnel.
 Our Quench platform is also well‑positioned to increase sales to existing customers. In addition to our sales team, our customer care representatives generate revenue by selling additional products to existing customers. In addition, as we service our rental equipment, we routinely identify opportunities to reassess our customer’s needs and offer additional services and system upgrades. Frequently, Quench rental customers will add systems during the course of their relationship with Quench.

 We intend to continue to differentiate our offering to customers by adding new and innovative water filtration products and related water‑enabled products. We are also considering additional international and residential market expansion in our POU business.
 Customers
 Within our direct sales channel, we target businesses across the United States and Canada with an emphasis on companies with 20 or more employees, as well as those operating in several key industries, such as government, education, medical, retail and hospitality. We maintain a highly diversified customer base of approximately 50,000 customers. Within our indirect sales channel, we sell to established networks with approximately 250 POU dealers and retailers in the United States and Canada, and we are actively expanding this network through our ongoing sales and marketing activities.  Customer Service
 Our service technicians are trained to service our rental POU systems to ensure a convenient, reliable water supply. In larger metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada, we service rental equipment via local employee service technicians, who perform installations, preventive maintenance and repairs. In areas without local employees, Quench technicians travel to handle installations and preventive maintenance. When necessary, Quench engages third‑party contractors for certain types of service calls. Competition
 We compete directly with other POU filtration, BWC, and office coffee service, or OCS, companies, as well as with retail stores and internet sites where similar products and services may be purchased. Municipal tap water is also a substitute for our POU filtration services. The POU filtration market is highly fragmented, with many small, local service providers. There are also a number of larger national competitors, including Cott Corporation, which offers BWC, OCS and POU services; Nestle, which offers BWC and POU services; Aramark, Compass Water Solutions, and Waterlogic International, which offer OCS and POU services. Our competitive position is based on our pricing, national service coverage and product quality.
 Although Zenith reported that in 2015 the POU segment we serve accounted for 11.1% by revenue of the $4.2 billion per year, the number of POU units has been growing consistently and is projected to continue to grow at the expense of BWCs. We believe POU systems offer an attractive alternative to BWCs primarily due to cost, convenience, health benefits and environmental considerations. In 2015, approximately 29% of all new POU accounts (commercial and residential) in the United States were attributed to BWC conversions. We believe that the quality and reliability of our service, both in the field and in the back office, are differentiators within our markets.
 Market Opportunity
 We primarily operate in three water sectors—desalination, wastewater treatment and water reuse and commercial water filtration. We believe these sectors offer us opportunities for significant organic and inorganic growth due to their size, positive long‑term growth trends and fragmentation.
 A number of key macroeconomic factors shape the global water sector, including population growth, an increasing water supply‑demand imbalance, urbanization, industrialization, and consumers’ heightened health and environmental awareness. Global water demand has outpaced population growth, leading to chronic water scarcity in many regions around the world. According to data from the United Nations, global water demand (excluding irrigation) will grow three times faster than the global population. According to the 2018 United Nations World Water Development Report, an estimated 3.6 billion people live in areas that are potential water scarce at least one month per year, and this population could increase to 4.8 to 5.7 billion by 2050.  Further, the 2030 Water Resources Group, a public-private-civil society collaboration facilitated by the International Finance Corporation, estimates that global water demand will exceed supply by 40% by 2030. The United Nations Environment Programme, an agency of the United Nations that coordinates environmental programs, estimates that roughly half of the world’s population currently lives within 40 miles of the sea. Because of the proximity of population centers to saltwater bodies, we believe desalination through our Seven Seas Water platform is a viable solution to address future water shortages.

 As clean water demand continues to grow, we believe the need for water treatment technologies, such as desalination, wastewater treatment and POU filtration, will increase, and we believe both of our operating platforms are well positioned to benefit from these trends.
 Global Desalination Market
 In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the installation of new seawater desalination capacity. According to a December 2018 update by Global Water Intelligence’s (GWI) Desaldata, total estimated desalination market capital expenditures were estimated to reach over $4.8 billion in 2018, increasing to over $8.6 billion in 2021. Many of the existing medium‑scale plants are owned and operated by local governments and companies, and operating desalination facilities is generally not their core competency. As a result, we believe a large number of these plants could benefit from our ownership and operating expertise to generate more reliable and lower‑cost clean water.
 According to the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct rankings, the Caribbean is one of the most water‑scarce regions of the world in terms of fresh water availability, comparable to the Western Sahara and parts of the Middle East. We believe our Seven Seas Water platform is a leading desalination solution provider in the Caribbean, where we operate ten water treatment facilities. Our installed capacity in the Caribbean has grown from 9.2 million GPD in 2010 to 29.9 million GPD as of December 31, 2018. Based on information published by GWI, we believe we represent a significant portion of the existing medium‑scale desalination plant capacity in the Caribbean. Many of the Caribbean region’s current desalination facilities utilize older thermal technologies that are more costly to operate than membrane‑based SWRO systems. We believe replacing these thermal plants with new SWRO plants is a significant additional opportunity for us. Given our compelling value proposition, extensive presence, and operational expertise in SWRO plants, we believe we are well positioned to further grow our Caribbean business.
 We currently have a presence or targeted business development activities primarily in the Caribbean, South America, the Middle East, Africa and North America. The total installed capacity of medium‑scale desalination plants in these locations is more than 2 billion GPD. We target specific attractive end markets, such as the municipal drinking water, mining, oil and gas, and ultra‑pure industrial process water markets, in both large and mature markets in North America and the Middle East, as well as in fast‑growing developing markets in South America, Africa and the Caribbean. We believe we are well positioned to pursue opportunities in these markets through new project development, partnerships with local firms and strategic acquisitions.
 Wastewater Treatment and Water Reuse Market 
 Wastewater treatment processes improve water quality by reducing the toxins that cause harm to humans and pollute rivers, lakes and oceans. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 2017 Infrastructure report card, it is estimated that the demand on existing wastewater treatment plants will grow by more than 23% by 2032 and that $271 billion is needed in wastewater infrastructure over the next 25 years. Evidence of the funding gap in wastewater infrastructure exists already in the United States and ASCE’s 2016 Failure to Act report estimates that 900 billion gallons of untreated sewage is discharged into the environment each year. Part of the solution for reducing stress on existing centralized wastewater treatment plants will be the addition of wastewater treatment capacity through decentralized solutions. Decentralized wastewater treatment solutions reduce the need for extensive upgrades and expansion of larger, centralized plants. In addition, these decentralized wastewater treatment solutions have faster implementation cycles, have higher potential for onsite water reuse and are more capital-efficient as modular designs can be expanded as capacity is needed.
 According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s 2017 Potable Reuse Compendium, long-term water scarcity is expected to increase over time in many parts of the United States which will drive the increase for wastewater reuse. In 2017, the Watereuse Association estimated the market for wastewater reuse in the United States was $1.8 billion, which is expected to grow by 27% by 2027. As water scarcity increases, so will the need to reuse wastewater. There is a significant opportunity to reuse wastewater in the United States as currently only approximately 7 to 8% of municipal wastewater is reclaimed for reuse, leaving a large potential for additional reuse capacity.

While a majority of our wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions in the United States are concentrated in Texas, we are focused on and believe we are capable of providing, solutions across all 50 states and internationally. Globally, according to GWI, global installed reuse capacity has more than doubled since 2010 with this growth trend expected to continue into the future. 
 U.S. Water Cooler Market
 A 2016 study by Zenith estimates that the U.S. water cooler market will generate $4.2 billion of revenues in 2015, on an install base of more than 5.8 million BWC and POU units. POU units represent $467 million of these revenues and 1.4 million of the installed units, of which 94% are within the commercial market segment, which we target. We believe that POU units are taking market share from BWC units for a variety of reasons, including cost, convenience, health benefits and environmental concerns. Zenith reports that in the United States, the average BWC customer will spend $50.85 per month for bottles (5.01 bottles per month at an average price of $10.15 each) plus $19.80 per month to rent the base unit, implying an average total monthly spend of $70.65 per BWC unit. This compares with Zenith’s estimated average monthly rental rate for a POU unit in the United States of $35.15. Zenith indicates that from 2010 to 2015, the market share of POU on an installed unit basis grew from 16.4% to 23.5%, which represents a unit CAGR of 10% for that period. Zenith expects the total number of POU units to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9% between 2015‑2020, while the number of total installed BWC units is projected to grow at a CAGR of only 1% during the same period.
 We estimate that our rental market share is less than 10% of commercial POU systems on an installed unit basis based on the industry installed unit data per the Zenith study. The U.S. POU water cooler market is highly fragmented with hundreds of small regional providers, representing an opportunity for consolidation. Given the size of our addressable market and the fragmentation of the industry, we believe we are well positioned to realize growth with our focus on the commercial POU market.

 Strong Competitive Position Supported by Long‑Term Customer Relationships
 We have long‑standing customer relationships. In our experience, customers typically extend their contracts significantly beyond the original term, as the need for the specific solution continues and the customer realizes the value proposition of our WAAS business model. Furthermore, we believe our operating and engineering expertise, experienced management team, and scale put us at the forefront of our industry, and that significant investment would be required for others to replicate our platforms.
 Our water supply agreements under our Seven Seas Water platform typically provide for initial terms of up to 20 years and typically contain contractual provisions for cost pass‑through and minimum volume requirements. In addition, we have a reputation for quality and customer service. We have a track record of expanding and extending our initial contracts into longer‑term agreements with increasing water purchase volumes, in part, because we provide our customers with a cost‑effective and reliable water solution.
 Our lease agreements for wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions under our Seven Seas Water platform typically provide for initial terms of up to five years with automatic renewal provisions. With annual lease customer attrition of less than 5%, our customer relationships typically extend for 15 years or longer. Further, as our customers’ needs for additional wastewater treatment equipment expands, we believe our modular based solutions provide a strategic solution for our customers to meet the increased demand through incremental long-term agreements. 
 In the 2016 study by Zenith International, our Quench platform was named one of the top five companies in the POU industry based on the number of POU units rented or sold. For company-owned and billed rental units, our current typical initial contract term is three years with an automatic renewal provision, and our annual unit attrition rate, at December 31, 2018, was approximately 7.5%, implying an average rental period of more than 12 years, in part, because we provide highly reliable and efficient services. We believe our scale, product breadth and reliability, and customer service are key differentiators in a highly fragmented industry primarily composed of smaller providers.
 Significant Experience Identifying and Integrating Acquisitions
 Identifying and executing value‑enhancing acquisitions are core to our growth strategy. Under our Seven Seas Water platform, we have acquired five operating desalination facilities since 2007, which had an aggregate capacity of 9.8 million GPD at the time of acquisition and one wastewater treatment and water reuse company. Quench has completed 23 acquisitions since 2008, nine of which occurred during 2018. We believe the recent acquisitions are indicative of the opportunity for future inorganic growth to increase our market share and expand our service coverage footprint. We routinely evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and believe our experience and success in identifying, executing, integrating and operating acquisitions enable us to deploy capital effectively, create shareholder value and increase our market share. Strong Financial Performance
 We have demonstrated sustained revenue growth with attractive margins under long‑term customer relationships.
 Our revenues grew at a CAGR of 39.3% from 2013 through 2018. We believe we can continue our revenue growth by acquiring projects and customers, expanding our relationships with our customers, expanding into new geographies and complementary services, and selectively acquiring related water services businesses.
 Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $20.7 million, $24.9 million and $20.9 million, respectively. See Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Our desalination plants operate safely and efficiently with an average availability of approximately 97% since 2013, providing an uninterrupted supply of water for our customers. Our wastewater treatment and water reuse equipment is based on a conventional, proven design to ensure reliability of all operating components. Our Quench platform benefits from significant economies of scale that are expected to continue as the business grows.
 Drive Sustainable and Profitable Growth
 We are focused on long‑term, sustainable equity returns and intend to continue to deploy capital in attractive rate of return opportunities. Across both our Seven Seas Water and Quench platforms, we have recurring revenue that is derived from predictable and contractually‑obligated payments. In addition, certain of our Seven Seas Water margins benefit from contractual inflation‑protection and cost pass‑through provisions.
 We believe our differentiated WAAS business model results in attractive unit economics. As a result, we believe our growth will enhance operating leverage and drive margin expansion for both the Seven Seas Water and Quench platforms. 

Develop New Business Opportunities and Add New Customers for Growth
 We intend to continue to develop new business opportunities and add new customers supported by our experienced sales and marketing teams. Our Seven Seas Water platform has dedicated business development teams focusing on new project development and acquisition opportunities globally. We strategically focus on providing desalination and wastewater treatment and water reuse solutions to governmental, municipal (including utility districts), industrial, property developer and hospitality customers in North America, the Middle East, South America, Africa, new territories in the Caribbean and other select international markets.

Quench has an experienced and growing team of sales and marketing professionals responsible for new customer acquisition and expansion of existing customer relationships. Our sales representatives leverage our innovative, internet‑focused marketing and lead generation platform to add new customers. We also have dedicated sales teams targeting certain industries, such as government, education and medical, as well as large enterprise, dealer and wholesale opportunities.

Drive Growth through Increased Sales to Current Customers
 Both our Seven Seas Water and Quench platforms are well positioned to realize growth through incremental sales to current customers due to our longstanding relationships developed as a result of our reliable operating performance, competitive pricing and highly‑rated customer service.
 Our Seven Seas Water platform has a track record of increasing sales to current customers through expansions of existing facilities to meet increasing demands for the customer and extensions of existing contracts to provide water over a longer period of time.
 In addition, Seven Seas Water maintains a fleet of containerized and bypass wastewater treatment solutions for rapid deployment and commissioning. This gives us a competitive advantage when responding to short-term or immediate needs. Once these systems are operating, we have the opportunity to demonstrate the high reliability our plants have achieved elsewhere. With respect to our desalination solutions, we have had significant success converting these short‑term customer relationships into much longer (10 to 20 years) contractual agreements. 

Within Quench’s direct sales channel, our existing customers continue to provide significant opportunities for us to offer additional products and services. Many of our rental customers add water coolers or upgrade them during their relationship with us, and many also opt to rent equipment from our newer product lines enabled by POU water filtration, such as ice machines, sparkling water coolers and coffee brewers. Within Quench’s indirect sales channel, many of our dealers are also opting to purchase equipment from our newer product lines, such as ice machines.

Continued Development of New Product Offerings to Open New Market Opportunities
 We intend to pursue new market opportunities and customers with our Seven Seas Water platform by leveraging our emergency response capabilities and specialized water supply systems for large‑scale industrial operations such as mining, power generation and high volume water consumption manufacturing activities. We invest in containerized and bypass wastewater treatment plants to enable us to provide rapid solutions for customers who require services quickly, including in emergency situations. We are also actively examining and pursuing governmental, municipal, industrial and hospitality wastewater recovery opportunities as well as opportunities to treat water associated with oil and gas exploration.

In our Quench business, we intend to continue leveraging our manufacturing capabilities, exclusive supply relationships, and market knowledge, to expand and refine our water cooler product offerings and our other related water‑enabled products, such as ice machines, sparkling water systems and coffee brewers. 
 Selectively Pursue Acquisitions
 Acquisitions have historically been a major growth driver for us, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. Both Seven Seas Water and Quench have dedicated teams that actively identify opportunities to expand our business and geographic presence, broaden our service offerings and allow us to move into additional markets.
 Through our Seven Seas Water platform, we intend to continue to selectively acquire complementary businesses that will align with either our desalination or wastewater treatment and water reuse offerings. Our strategy includes proactive deal sourcing where we identify and pursue the acquisition of assets or businesses from companies that align or complement our existing Seven Seas Water offerings. As it relates to targeted desalination assets or businesses, we intend to purchase, upgrade, expand and operate existing water treatment and desalination facilities in new and current markets, including those from companies which own and operate a single desalination facility. We believe we can often operate these desalination facilities more efficiently and reliably than current operators by leveraging our engineering and operating expertise.
 We believe the highly fragmented nature of the POU filtered water market will allow Quench to continue to identify and acquire POU companies to increase penetration of our current markets, broaden our product offerings and expand geographically.
 While we routinely identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions, there can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. If we enter into definitive agreements, there can be no assurances that all the conditions precedent to completing those acquisitions will be satisfied or waived, or that the acquisitions will be completed. Further, if we make any acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate or integrate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy.
