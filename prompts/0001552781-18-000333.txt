Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Daniels Corporate Advisory has established a permanent capital and talent base upon which to provide the corporate strategy consulting services noted below. A variety of methods to support this two-pronged effort include the issuance of additional shares of the parent and the subsidiary housing the incubating client. This can be achieved through private placement and/or issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock and loans from senior officers and other direct management or investment participants. A sustained flow of Strategy Assignments is expected through the networking of senior executives and board and advisory board additions. This may include the purchase of rights to provide financial strategy packages to clients of other financial/business services companies. While rights agreements of this nature are not typical, senior management, drawing on personal contacts and those of credentialed members of its Corporate Strategy Advisory Board believes that offering to provide a very select cost-effective service that with our permanent in-house professionals will augment other financial services already being offered by the financial/business services firm entering into the rights agreement is an acceptable additional option for accelerating the growth of Daniels. However, there is no assurance that has time goes by a financial/business service business client may decide to enter our business and there is no provision in our agreement to prevent that from happening. However, our senior management believes that our success with the ultimate client, - the client of a financial/business services firm contracting with us for our strategy services, will determine whether Daniels Corporate Advisory retains the client or not.
 
The services incorporated into corporate strategy advisory and implementation to help formulate a path for the acceleration of corporate development (growth) for the ultimate (end user) client include market analysis, deal negotiation and structure, determination of optimum finance alternatives, the creation of joint-ventures, marketing agreements, new product/creation additions and acquisitions. Daniels has a loosely organized cadre of highly-qualified, independent contractors/consultants available to perform the necessary services to achieve the optimum corporate strategy for a client.
 
Daniels is developing direct methods for obtaining clients, namely creating brand advertising in industry niches of interest and subsequent referral by a stockholder or partner. Name brand recognition will be refined and expanded with bigger budget dollars after one or two successful corporate strategy assignments have been completed.
 The “specialty” services that have been perfected through success will be publicizing on our and the client’s website for worldwide recognition.
 
As our presence in the market place becomes more visible, through publication on client websites of our successes in our initial corporate strategy consulting assignments added financing options with more competitive firms are expected to materialize for the benefit of all our clients. Capital companies and high-net worth (accredited) individuals may contact us to see if they may participate directly in subsequent assignments.
 

Recent Business Developments
 
The Company is operating through the corporate strategy segment of its business. It is attempting to build its own critical mass by creation of start-up subsidiaries it believes have promise/potential. The stated goal is for the parent (DCAC) company to consolidate the critical mass of subsidiaries to meet the financial requirements for up-listing to a major Stock Exchange.
 
Senior management and our advisory board are developing a corporate strategy platform for a specific client.
 
The Company conducts on-going networking and business development in corporate strategy through its chairman, on a chairman to chairman basis, through the networks of its Advisory Board Members and its expanded, independent contractor consulting team. A full range of disciplines are offered to the mini-cap public and private company through personalized relationship networking to keep initial marketing costs at a minimum. Disciplines being offered are operational strategies, market-planning, senior oversight management and financial alternatives consulting on optimum paths for the client to take. This could include but not be limited to external growth alternatives requiring advisory on M & A, levered transactions, capital structure, bridge loans, and equity financing.

Business Strategy - Current Operational Strategy & Current Client Projects:
 
Daniels creates and implements corporate strategy alternatives for the mini-cap public or private company client. The addition of new business opportunities and the location of professional talent for implementation is anticipated through the full-time efforts of our senior management. These efforts are to be expanded in the US and in Foreign capitals by an expanding advisory board and through the networks of independent consultants. Principals of the respective client company will open their networks to augment professional access for specialties the Daniels corporate strategy consultants believe are needed in a jointly-venture, (jointly-controlled) undertaking created for the client’s optimum growth.
 
Daniels may provide the client with multiple corporate strategies /opportunities including joint-ventures, marketing opportunity agreements and/or potential acquisitions structured in LBO format. One or a combination of these strategies would allow the client to enter new market niches or expand further into existing ones.
 
The Goal: Within twenty-four months from commencement of a Corporate Strategy Assignment, financial results, aided by all participating players, should be forthcoming and recorded in SEC Filings. At the same time, a senior management team and Board expanded with highly-credible interim (or permanent) professionals (directors) will be provided in order to successfully navigate the listing process of a major Stock Exchange. While Daniels believes this process should be successful in the above-noted, time period, there is some uncertainty in the process which is dependent upon any past issues the listing committee of a specific exchange may deem necessary to be addressed prior to uplifting.
 
A similar effort will be provided to tailor an optimum growth program for the private company client, whether it chooses to remain private or to become a public company through alternative merger opportunities.


OPTIMUM GROWTH STRATEGY:
 
Twelve to Twenty-Four Month Horizons for Daniels’ Objectives:
 
Daniels’ believes that the validity of its corporate strategy model will be proven further through the success of several of its client/incubation/subsidiary deals. The Company plans to use its publicly traded common stock, in a variety of securities packages, including anti-dilutive Convertible Preferred Stock, to finance a subsidiary start-up, initially for generic sales/profits growth. Subsequent growth options noted above will be applied as external growth becomes a secondary goal. This method of two stage (generic and then external) growth is designed to leave existing client management with commanding equity and operating control positions. Eventually, an optimum exit strategy will be developed for the subsidiary, one that returns a significant return on corporate (parent) capital. The choices of optimum exit strategies could include bringing a subsidiary public, directly, or merging it with a public company operating in one of the more profitable niches of the specific market designated for expansion. The same corporate strategy model can/will be applied to any independent mini-cap public client.
 
We believe our business model to be scalable. Based upon the potential success of the initial corporate strategy consulting assignments creating our uplifting to a major Stock Exchange, Daniels may entertain the creation of a franchising plan for key US Cities and Foreign Capitals or Finance Centers.

Sales and Marketing
 
Daniels senior management will concentrate its efforts to expand its corporate strategy and financial advisory services and related specialties in the mini-cap segment of the private and public markets, where Daniels believes it will be effective. Marketing efforts will increase through social and print media efforts and will be in addition to those methods already mentioned herein.
 
Daniels objective is to create and help manage implementation of accelerated expansion strategies and in so doing, aid in the creation of financing alternatives to accomplish client goals.
 
Competition
 
Existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive price and performance characteristics.
 
In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to meet competition or maintain prices and choose only those assignments with new clients, that have pressing goals to be met, that offer Daniels optimum potential for profits and growth.
 
The “collective” corporate financial services, including merchant banking/private equity, are very competitive and fragmented in the Company’s market niche. There are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market. A significant number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources. We are and will continue to offer equity compensation to our team of Advisory Board Members, and independent strategy consultants in order to keep a stable, cohesive team of professionals, which is necessary and key to the creation of operating and capital solutions in a timely fashion.
