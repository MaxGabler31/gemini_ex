ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History



Quantum Computing Inc. (“QCI” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 25, 2001, as Ticketcart, Inc. Ticketcart’s original business plan involved in the sale of ink-jet cartridges online. Ticketcart offered remanufactured and compatible cartridges for Hewlett-Packard, Epson, Lexmark, and Canon inkjet printers. On July 25, 2007, Ticketcart, Inc. acquired Innovative Beverage Group, Inc. and changed its name to Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc. (“IBGH”) to better reflect its business operations at the time which was beverage distribution and product development. In 2013, IBGH ceased operations. On May 22, 2017, one of IBGH’s shareholders, William Alessi (the “Plaintiff”), filed suit against the Company alleging “(1) fraud; and (2) breach of fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and good faith to the Corporation’s shareholders.” Mr. Alessi’s complaint alleged that the officers and directors of IBGH had abandoned it and allowed the Company’s assets to be wasted, causing injury to the Company and its shareholders. Mr. Alessi sought damages of $30,000 for each claim, plus reimbursement of filing costs of $1,000, and the appointment of a Receiver for the Company.



On August 28, 2017, the North Carolina Court, Superior Court Division (the “North Carolina Court”), entered a default judgment for Plaintiff and appointed an exclusive Receiver (the “Receiver”) over the Company. The default judgment provided that Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc. was (i) to issue to the Plaintiff 18,500,000 shares of free-trading stock without registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) issue 100,000,000 shares of stock to Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc.’s treasury, and (iii) that the receivership be terminated upon any change of control, and that any and all claims against Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc. that were not submitted to the Receiver as of September 16, 2017, were disallowed. On October 4, 2017 the Receiver filed Articles of Incorporation in North Carolina for Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, (“IBGH North Carolina”). On October 26, 2017, Innovative Beverage Group, Inc. redomiciled to North Carolina.

On January 22, 2018, while the Company was in receivership, the Company (acting through the court-appointed receiver in her capacity as CEO and sole Director of the Company) sold 500,000 shares (the “CRG Shares”) of its common stock to Convergent Risk Group (“CRG”, or “Convergent Risk”), an entity owned and operated by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Liscouski, for $155,000. On February 21, 2018, by written consent of the majority shareholder (Convergent Risk), Mr. Robert Liscouski (the Chief Executive Officer of Convergent Risk) and Mr. Christopher Roberts were elected as members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Liscouski was simultaneously elected as Chairman of the Board. The majority shareholder also directed the Company to take the necessary action to change its domicile from North Carolina to Delaware and change its name to Quantum Computing Inc. On February 21, 2018, the Company filed Articles of Conversion in North Carolina to convert the Company to a Delaware corporation with the name changed to Quantum Computing Inc. On February 22, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion in Delaware to convert to a Delaware corporation with the name changed to Quantum Computing Inc. and re-domiciled to the state of Delaware on February 23, 2018.



The Computing Landscape and The End of Moore’s Law



For the past 45 years or so, silicon-based processor manufacturers have been able to double their processing power every 18 to 24 months, a phenomenon known in the computer industry as “Moore’s Law.” Recently, the computer processor industry has found it increasingly difficult to offer faster, more powerful processors due to fundamental physical effects limiting further size reduction of transistors.



Quantum computing is believed to be a potential solution to the hard limits now being approached by conventional computers that utilize silicon-based processors. The date of practical relevance of quantum computers is hard to determine. We believe it could be as soon as 2021, but a more conservative estimate is that quantum computers with gradually increasing performance will be introduced by multiple vendors over the course of the next decade.



Additionally, conventional computers are known to struggle with optimization problems known as NP-complete problems, which are a class of mathematical problems that can, in principle, be solved by conventional computers, with that caveat that the time to solution will grow exponentially with the size of the problem. These NP-complete problems require complex calculations, which cannot currently be performed in any reasonable amount of time using conventional computer systems for problem sizes relevant to many industrial and government applications.



Research suggests that quantum computers may be ideally suited to run optimization algorithms, where further advancements in quantum annealing and other quantum computing hardware could result in computational benefit over currently used conventional systems. The ability to solve NP-complete problems in a reasonable period of time is of particular interest in compute-heavy fields that include, but are not limited to: big data, artificial intelligence, healthcare, and cybersecurity. We believe these are natural markets for quantum computing, due to the immense compute power required to process large data sets, which have experienced exponential growth in size and complexity in recent years.

Our Company



The Company is focused on providing software tools and applications for quantum computers. We believe there is significant business opportunity in the quantum computing industry, and that the quantum computer has the potential to disrupt several global industries. Independent of when quantum computing delivers compelling performance advantage over conventional computing, the software tools and applications necessary for accelerating real-world problems must be developed to deliver on quantum computing’s full promise.



Quantum computing is a fundamentally new paradigm compared with conventional silicon-based computing, requiring a new and highly technical set of skills to create the software that will drive quantum results. Organizations seeking to gain advantage from the promise of quantum technology must acquire and develop skills in quantum mechanics, mathematics and physics, and a deep knowledge of the ever-changing quantum hardware. The pool of people with those skills today is limited and in high demand.



In order to address the steep learning curve and highly particular skillset associated with quantum computing, the Company is developing “quantum ready” software applications and solutions for commercial and government entities looking to leverage the expected future performance of quantum computing. We are focused on being an enabler – creating software that provide the advantages of advanced computing hardware for forward thinking clients.



By reducing the barriers to adoption for commercial and government entities in using quantum computing technologies to solve their most complex problems, we believe our products will accelerate quantum technology adoption similar to the adoption curve that has been witnessed with artificial intelligence. To this end, we are leveraging our collective expertise in finance, computing, mathematics and physics to develop a suite of applications that may enable global industries to utilize quantum computers, quantum annealers and digital simulators to improve their processes, profitability, and security.



Our Strategy



While the majority of the quantum computing market is focused on Quantum Computing hardware, we realized the traditional software development toolkit (“SDK”) approach to creating quantum computing software is poorly suited for non-quantum experts, given the completely new programming paradigm.

This represents a significant barrier to entry for companies looking to leverage novel quantum computing capabilities for their business needs. Utilizing quantum computers for real-world problems requires an abstract blend of a wide range of computing and non-computing expertise, including but not limited to:




● | Subject Matter Expertise (SME): As with any problem, the first step is for a business expert to rigorously define and describe what information and/or results the business requires. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Programming Excellence: In the conventional computing world, a programmer will take the problem defined by a SME (subject matter expert) and implement it using standardized applications to run on the computer. In quantum computing, programmers are required to explicitly program it for the quantum computer they have access to, requiring a deep understanding of sophisticated areas of expertise. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mathematics: The problems that are attractive for being solved using quantum computers require significant mathematical expertise to a) optimize the data and problem for quantum computers, b) create the quantum-specific algorithms and formulas required to solve the problem, c) iterate upon the results in a way that optimizes the performance, cost and quality of result. Mathematics is at the core of the many steps involved in quantum computing for optimizing, compressing and applying algorithms to the data for obtaining truly optimal results. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quantum Mechanics: Quantum computing demands deep knowledge of the principles driving the computing itself. Unlike conventional computers which utilize 0 or 1 bits, quantum computers utilize qubits, which leverage concepts of quantum mechanics such as probabilistic computation, superposition, and entanglement. Experts much understand these concepts to create the algorithms necessary to solve problems on a quantum computer. They must know how to “map” problems and their associated data into problems that are optimized in the specific way required for a quantum computer to accept and process the problem. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quantum Hardware Knowledge: QPUs (Quantum Processing Units) require that programmers manage the configuration, actions, and overall operations of all the underlying circuits utilized in solving the problem. For example, the programming to configure and access QPUs is low level and extremely complicated. This coding is proprietary to each vendor’s QPU idiosyncratic requirements, not to mention, unique to the specific count and version of QPUs in the system, right now. When the system is expended or a QPU upgraded, all the code has to be rewritten. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Given the dramatic differences in quantum computer hardware architectures currently under development, quantum software requires a dramatic shift from classic software, and requires creating every single circuit, gate, algorithm, action and process in software. Moreover, the collective requirements imposed upon companies looking to utilize quantum computers can require a training period of a year or longer, even for a highly qualified subject matter expert. Consequently, the time, difficult and expense of hiring such a diverse and deeply knowledgeable team to create quantum applications and workflows limits any organization’s ability to move forward quickly with the power of quantum computing.

Such difficulties have created a significant barrier to entry in quantum computing have informed the Company’s opportunities and goals, which are to:




1) | Deliver production-ready software that de-risk the shift to quantum computing; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Empower SMEs and programmers to access the power of quantum computing without the prerequisite quantum expertise; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Eliminate the vendor lock-in created by the low-level coding required for individual QPUs by allowing users to freely select the best QPU for their specific problem with no low-level coding or programming changes; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Deliver the best performance results (speed, quality and diversity) at the lowest cost for our users; and 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Provide software and the required hardware in the cloud to make it simple and cost effective for organizations to begin leveraging quantum computing. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Products and Products in Development



Qatalyst



Qatalyst (formerly Mukai) is our answer to the current state of the quantum computing industry. As the industry’s first publicly available Quantum Application Accelerator, Qatalyst enables developers to create and execute quantum-ready applications on conventional computers, while being ready to run on quantum computers where those systems achieve performance advantage. Qatalyst performs the complex problem transformations necessary to be executed on a variety of quantum platforms today, and users can call upon the same Qatalyst APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to achieve optimization performance advantages on conventional computers using our cloud-based solution.



Qatalyst dramatically reduces the time-to-quality results and the associated costs for both conventional and quantum computers. Unlike more common toolsets that require deep level quantum expertise to build new quantum problems and workflows, Qatalyst is not a tool kit, but a complete platform. It accelerates performance and results on classic and quantum computers, with no additional quantum programming or quantum computing expertise required. This is why it is unique in its approach to the quantum computing industry. Instead of invoking a team of quantum specialists to transform an optimization problem, an SME or programmer submits their current problem via a software API to the Qatalyst cloud-based platform. Qatalyst manages the workflow, optimizations, and results, without any further intervention by the user. Qatalyst provides a unique advantage to reduce applications development risks and costs by eliminating the need for scarce high-end quantum programmers.



Qatalyst is integrated with the Amazon Cloud BRAKET API, offering access to multiple Quantum Processing Units (“QPUs”) including DWave, Rigetti, and IonQ. Qatalyst also integrates directly with IBM’s QPUs.

By using Qatalyst, application developers can run their applications on any or all of the available QPUs by merely selecting which QPU they prefer to run on based on the desired performance results of the application. We believe this provides a substantial advantage over any other toolkit or platform in the market today. These advantages are significant not just for application developers but for any company that is considering using or exploring quantum computing technology for business applications.



Qatalyst also eliminates the need for the low-level hardware programming expertise required by toolkits. This programming is time consuming and must be updated constantly as QPUs evolve and change, resulting in significant development costs. Qatalyst automatically optimizes the same problem submitted by a SME for multiple Quantum and Conventional Processors. The SME or programmer selects one, or many, processing resources and the problem will be submitted by Qatalyst. This is an enormous advantage over any tool set in the market today. These advantages are significant not just for application developers but for any company that is considering using or exploring quantum computing technology for business applications.



The Company’s innovative Qatalyst software masks the complexity of quantum programming via the Q API, a powerful six call API that users can learn in a day. Instead of spending months or years developing new applications and workflows requiring complex and extremely low-level coding, users, workflows or applications can immediately submit a problem to Qatalyst within a day, using the same familiar constructs they use right now, via the Q API. Users have utilized Qatalyst’s simple API and familiar constructs to solve their first complex problem within a week, as compared to the 6-12 months associated with quantum software toolkits.



Qatalyst Features



Today, SMEs can leverage the power of Qatalyst to solve high-value discrete optimization problems present in finance, bio/pharma, and cybersecurity. Currently, Qatalyst offers the following features:

● | Quantum-ready engines tuned for complex computations. These engines automatically optimize, submit, and iterate to return excellent, diverse results for supply chain and other constrained optimization problems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transparent abstraction from quantum hardware variance. Qatalyst eliminates the need to write low-level, assembly-type code to support different vendors’ quantum hardware architectures, such as D-Wave, Rigetti, IBM and ION-Q. The same problem can run seamlessly across all quantum types and architectures. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Qatalyst Core: an engine that utilizes sophisticated mathematics, quantum transformation and iterative processing to find highly optimal answers across both classic and quantum computers. For example, LaGrange multipliers, which work to compress and simplify the problem prior to constraint optimization. The Core applies these advanced mathematical techniques, based on the type of problem and processing required. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Q Graph: a powerful transformation engine that empowers SMEs to submit and analyze graph models as part of their complex optimizations. Q Graph accepts familiar graph models and functions including Clique Cover, Community Detection and Partitioning. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Qontrol: a portal that provides administrative management tools for user administration, request control, statuses and alerts. Qontrol also enables system administrators and users to import Qatalyst results into popular analysis applications such as Excel or Tableau. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity



It is important to note that our product utilizes a software technique known as a “Solver” (qci-Qbsolv), which is a set of instructions whose function is to calculate the minimum values of a large optimization problem, which is presented in the form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization or “QUBO”. The Company’s Solvers deliver the the aforementioned performance advantages while running on today’s conventional computers and will be able to deliver significantly improved performance as better QPU technology becomes available. To that end, the Company is beginning to seek marketing and distribution partnerships where our current solver technologies can be deployed to enable industry-specific application performance.



The Company is also working on software products to address community detection to aid researchers in discovering correlations that may not have been imagined. We believe that community detection holds significant promise in pharmaceutical applications such as evaluating client trial outcomes, and in epidemiology to enable detection of common factors among a population.



In addition to commercial markets, the Company is pursuing a number of US government funded opportunities.



The US Government, through the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018 (“NQIA”), which was signed into law on December 21, 2018, established the goal to ensure the continued leadership of the United States in quantum information science and its technology applications. The NQIA provides for a coordinated Federal program to accelerate quantum research and development for the economic and national security of the United States. The NQIA authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), to strengthen QIS Programs, Centers, and Consortia. The NQIA also calls for a coordinated approach to QIS Research and Development (R&D) efforts across the United States Government, including the civilian, defense, and intelligence sectors. Significant government funding has been allocated for research initiatives including a fiscal year 2020 Department of Energy initiative of $625 million over the next five years to establish two to five multidisciplinary Quantum Information Science (QIS) Research Centers in support of the National Quantum Initiative. The Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C), a consortium of stakeholders that aims to enable and grow the U.S. quantum industry. QED-C was established with support from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of the Federal strategy for advancing quantum information science. The Company is one of the founding members of the QED-C.

Technology Provider Partnerships



The Company is pursuing a number of commercial partnerships and research areas funded by the government that directly relate to its capabilities. To strengthen its technology base, the Company has entered into teaming agreements with companies to partner on joint pursuit of those opportunities or to offer services available through those partners.
Splunk Technology Alliance Partnership Agreement



The Company is pursuing a number of research areas funded by the government that directly relate to its capabilities. To strengthen its technology base, the Company has entered into a Technology Alliance Partnership agreement with Splunk, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLK). The Company is partnering with Splunk to pursue government funded efforts to do both fundamental and applied research and develop analytics that exploit conventional large-data cybersecurity stores and data-analytics workflows, combined with quantum-ready graph and constrained-optimization algorithms. These algorithms will initially be developed using the Company’s Qatalyst software platform, which enables quantum-ready algorithms to execute on conventional hardware and also to run without modification on QC hardware when ready. Once proofs of concept are completed, the Company and Splunk will develop new analytics with these algorithms in the Splunk data-analytics platform, to evaluate quantum analytics readiness on real-world data. The Splunk platform/toolkits help customers address challenging analytical problems via neural nets or custom algorithms, extensible to Deep Learning frameworks through an open source approach that incorporates existing and custom libraries. The initial efforts of our partnership with Splunk will focus on three key challenges; network security, dynamic logistics and scheduling.
Amazon Web Services – BRAKET



Quantum Computing is the first company with a quantum software development and execution platform to provide the widest selection of QCs via the cloud, including those offered by IonQ, D-Wave, Rigetti, and others via Amazon Braket. Amazon Braket is a fully managed quantum computing service that helps researchers and developers get started with the technology to accelerate research and discovery. Amazon Braket provides a development environment for users to explore and build quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit simulators, and run them on different quantum hardware technologies. Quantum Computing provides access to subject matter experts and applications developers to quantum computers available on Amazon Braket via its Qatalyst software. The Company intends to expand the capabilities available through the Amazon Braket service going forward, and also plans to provide access to additional quantum computers through Qatalyst over the next several months.



QikStart



Management believes that the development of real-world use cases, not just science projects, is critical to the forward momentum of quantum computing as a practical tool. To that end, the Company has created an internally funded program called QikStart which provides access to Qatalyst and cloud-based resources, experts, and funding to explore and push the boundaries of quantum computing for delivering practical business results, today.

Industry Overview



We operate in the large and global high-performance computing industry, which is comprised of hardware, software, and services for compute intensive applications. The rapid adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence, 3D imaging, and the Internet of Things (IoT), have served to exponentially increase the generation of data, driving up the demand for high-performance computing. Computationally intensive applications are ubiquitous across various industries, including, but not limited to: IT, aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and e-commerce. Examples of compute intensive applications include optimization, data management, analytics, and complex modeling. Estimates of the size of this industry vary, but according to Grand View Research, the High-Performance computing market was valued at $39.1 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach a value of $53.6 billion by 2027. According to a report from Allied Market Research, the global enterprise quantum computing market size was valued at $1.3 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $18.3 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 29.7% from 2021 to 2030.



Quantum Computing is a nascent and rapidly developing technology ecosystem that has shown promise in delivering potentially disruptive computing capabilities. We believe Quantum Computing’s immense compute capabilities qualify it as a subset of High-Performance Computing. As quantum computing hardware continues to advance, we expect a corresponding growth in demand for software capable of leveraging the compute capabilities of Quantum Computing hardware. We are developing hardware agnostic software capable of delivering high-performance computing capabilities to various industries while mitigating dependency risks that may emerge from a dominant quantum computing hardware vendor. As an early participant in this rapidly growing ecosystem, we believe we are well-positioned to capture and drive a meaningful amount of this category growth. We also believe there is a significant international market opportunity for our future products.



We expect continued growth in the research and developing of the quantum computing industry, driven by interest from both the private and public sectors. According to a report published by the Quantum Daily, “The Quantum Annual 2021” (https://thequantuminsider.com/reports) a total of $3.2 billion was invested in quantum technology companies in 2021. In addition, the US Government has committed $1.3 billion to funding quantum information science programs under the National Quantum Initiative enacted in 2018.



The Company is a member of the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C). The QED-C, whose members include companies such as Google and Microsoft, has been tasked with developing the U.S. Quantum Computing Industry.



Competition



The Quantum Computing Industry is new and rapidly developing, and as such, is and will remain dynamic and extremely competitive for the foreseeable future. As this industry continues to grow and mature, we expect a steady influx of new products, hardware advances, and new concepts to emerge that can dramatically transform the industry and our business. One such example would be a practical application of “quantum supremacy”, which we expect to radically accelerate the interest and entry in the quantum computing industry. We perform a broad range of research and development efforts to identify and position for the changing demands of future customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.

Based on our internal research and knowledge, there are over 130 companies and research universities who are known to be engaged in research and development relating to quantum computing. These entities range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources such as Google, Honeywell and IBM to smaller privately funded startups whose narrower product focuses may let them be more effective in deploying resources towards a specific industry demand. Our business objectives and near term strategy put us in direct competition with existing software vendors for high performance computing, who may not be operating in the quantum computing ecosystem.



We believe competition in this market segment will intensify. Many of our competitors may have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, and greater name recognition. Our competitors could use these resources to market or develop products or services that are more effective or less costly than any or all of our products or services.



The software segment of the quantum computing ecosystem is still in its infancy, and to our knowledge a market-dominant entity has not yet been established. Due to the high price point of quantum computing hardware, novel business models may emerge to adapt to consumer preferences in the high-performance computing industry. Our ability to evolve and adapt rapidly over an extended period of time will be critical in remaining competitive.



Government Regulation and Incentives



Financial Algorithms



US firms and FINRA members that use financial algorithms to conduct high frequency trading are subject to SEC and FINRA regulations that govern their trading activities under long standing rules governing supervision and control practices to reduce the likelihood of market disruptions and ensure effective communication between the firm’s compliance staff and its trading strategy personnel. Additional regulation on financial algorithms has been proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) aimed at limiting the potential for financial algorithms and high frequency trading to disrupt markets. The proposed regulations would require firms using such algorithms to implement pre-trade risk controls, limit self-trading and make the source code of the software programs available to the government upon request. To the Company’s knowledge, these regulations, especially the mandatory source code disclosure provisions, have been vigorously opposed by the industry and have not yet been implemented.



The government agencies charged with regulating financial markets in the US and around the world have so far not closely regulated financial algorithms or algorithmic trading, but that could change in response to future market events. The benefit of algorithmic trading is that it can bring greater liquidity, transparency and accountability to markets, and also reduces price variations between global markets. Financial markets in many developing countries have benefited from implementation of algorithmic trading. There are, of course, limitations to what financial algorithms can accomplish today with conventional super computers, and when multiple algorithms trade in lockstep a single price fluctuation can trigger a cascade of downward trades that can crash a market very quickly, before human intervention can stop the downward spiral. This phenomenon is known as a “Flash Crash” and regulators have imposed some regulations to slow down or suspend trading when a market drops more than a fixed percentage in a short period of time.

Encryption



The U.S. government has historically tightly regulated the export of cryptographic technologies under the Arms Export Control Act and the associated International Traffic in Arms regulations (ITAR) as a form of munition. The logic behind the export restrictions is that the ability to secure information has great value to the military and intelligence agencies, and the US Government does not want those technologies sold or distributed to foreign adversaries. These regulations were relaxed in 1996 by executive order, but restrictions are still in place under the Export Administration Act that limit the export of some advanced encryption methods and technologies. Export of commercial encryption products to certain designated countries and terrorist groups is restricted, as are exports of military quality encryption technologies. Restrictions on encryption technology are in place in many other countries but the extent of regulation varies widely from country to country. Domestically, encryption technology is largely unregulated but law enforcement, intelligence and investigative agencies work closely with encryption technology developers to enable the US government to access encrypted data under certain conditions. We believe that the quantum encryption and decryption products that QCI plans to develop can be marketed to government agencies seeking to unlock encrypted data or to encrypt and protect sensitive government data from unauthorized exposure.
Incentives



In 2018, Congress authorized $1.3 billion over five years to fund quantum related research projects. This funding is being administered by the U.S. Department of Defense which will solicit proposals for research. The Company intends to submit proposals for funding, but there can be no guarantee the Company will be chosen or that the Company will receive any government funding. In addition, in 2018, President Trump announced the formation of a National Quantum Initiative consisting of key technology companies working in the field of quantum computing. The Company is a member of that Initiative and is also a member of the Quantum Economic Development Council.



In December 2018, Congress passed the National Quantum Initiative Act (the “Quantum Act”), which was signed into law on December 21, 2018. The purpose of the Quantum Act is to “ensure the continued leadership of the United States in quantum information science” and to develop a unified national strategy for researching quantum information science. The Quantum Act authorizes a National Quantum Coordination Office inside the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy to help coordinate research between agencies, serve as the federal point of contact and promote private commercialization of federal research breakthroughs over the next decade.

The Quantum Act also authorized:




● | Up to five National Quantum Information Science Research Centers within the Department of Energy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Research and education centers in the National Science Foundation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A “workshop of stakeholders” administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology “to discuss the future measurement, standards, cybersecurity, and other appropriate needs for supporting the development of a robust quantum information science and technology industry in the United States.” 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (“QIS”) under the National Science and Technology Council. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee to advise the President. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The overall goals of the Quantum Act include the eventual creation of industry standards for QIS development, new research grant funding and increased collaboration with the private sector. Quantum technology, including quantum computing, has drawn significant attention from Congress and the White House for its theoretical potential to increase computing power and disrupt encryption standards. Rival countries like China and Russia are pushing hard to improve their own QIS capabilities. In 2020, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy announced a fund of $1 billion to establish twelve artificial intelligence and quantum information science research centers nationwide



Employees



We currently have twenty-five full time employees and seven part time contract staff, twenty of whom are focused on product and software development, and six Technical Advisors (one from the National Security Domain, four from the Quantum/AI Domain, and two from the Financial Services Domain). We also have two third party partners providing software development and big data analysis services. The employees are not part of a collective bargaining agreement and labor relationships are good.
