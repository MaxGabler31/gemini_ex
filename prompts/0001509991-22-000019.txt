Item 1.  Business
General
Kosmos is a full-cycle deepwater independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused along the Atlantic Margins. Our key assets include production offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as a world-class gas development offshore Mauritania and Senegal. We also maintain a sustainable proven basin exploration program in Equatorial Guinea, Ghana and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Kosmos is listed on the NYSE and LSE and is traded under the ticker symbol KOS. 
Kosmos was founded in 2003 to find oil in under‑explored or overlooked parts of West Africa. In its relatively brief history, we have successfully opened two new hydrocarbon basins through the discovery of the Jubilee field offshore Ghana in 2007 and the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim field in 2015 (which includes the Ahmeyim and Guembeul-1 discovery wells offshore Mauritania and Senegal in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Jubilee was one of the largest oil discoveries worldwide in 2007 and is considered one of the largest finds offshore West Africa discovered during that decade. The Ahmeyim discovery was one of the largest natural gas discoveries worldwide in 2015 and is one of the largest gas discoveries ever offshore West Africa. 
Over the past few years, our business strategy has evolved to focus on production enhancing infill drilling and well work, infrastructure-led exploration as well as value-accretive acquisitions. This strategic evolution was initially enabled by our acquisition of the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex assets offshore Equatorial Guinea in 2017, together with access to surrounding exploration licenses, and bolstered by the 2018 acquisition of Deep Gulf Energy, a deepwater company operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which further enhanced our production, exploitation and infrastructure-led exploration capabilities. Most recently, this strategy was demonstrated by the recent acquisition of additional interests in the Jubilee and TEN fields offshore Ghana.    
Our Business Strategy
As a full-cycle deepwater E&P company, our mission is to safely deliver production and free cash flow from a portfolio rich in opportunities through a disciplined allocation of capital and optimal portfolio management for the benefit of our shareholders and stakeholders. As a responsible company, we are working to supply the energy the world needs today, find and develop cleaner energy to advance the energy transition, and be a force for good in our host countries.
Our business strategy is designed to accomplish this mission by focusing on three key objectives: (1) maximize the value of our producing assets; (2) progress our discovered resources toward project sanction and into proved reserves, production, and cash flow through efficient appraisal, development and exploitation; and (3) add new lower carbon resources through an efficient low cost exploration program in proven basins or acquisitions. We are focused on increasing production, cash flows and reserves from our producing assets in Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In Mauritania and Senegal, we are progressing our Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development with the objective of reaching first gas in the third quarter of 2023 while advancing the second phase of the development. In addition, our portfolio consists of large discovered resources and an inventory of prospects, which we plan to continue to mature for future drilling and development, providing us access to additional high return growth potential in the coming years. We are also working with our partners and host governments on projects to reduce the carbon intensity of our production assets, such as the elimination of routine flaring in Ghana.
Grow cash flow, proved reserves and production through exploitation, development and infrastructure-led exploration activities
We plan to grow cash flow, proved reserves and production by further exploiting our fields offshore Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In Equatorial Guinea, our activity set is expanding beyond production optimization projects, such as utilizing electrical submersible pumps, to include development drilling and infrastructure-led exploration which, if successful, can be brought online quickly via subsea tieback to existing infrastructure. In Ghana, we plan to continue drilling additional development and production wells at both the Jubilee and TEN fields. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we plan to continue development drilling in existing fields and maintain a deep inventory of infrastructure-led exploration targets. In addition, we have sanctioned the first phase of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development offshore Mauritania and Senegal, which defines the timing and path to first gas. Beyond the Phase 1 development of Greater Tortue Ahmeyim, growth is also expected to be realized through additional development phases of Greater Tortue Ahmeyim and through the development of all or a portion of our other natural gas discoveries in Mauritania and Senegal. During 2022, we 
plan to continue to mature development concepts from previous discoveries in Mauritania, Senegal, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea, as well as mature additional infrastructure-led prospects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Equatorial Guinea, and Ghana. 
Focus on optimally developing our discoveries to initial production
Our approach to development is designed to deliver first production on an accelerated timeline, leverage early learnings to improve future outcomes and maximize returns. In certain circumstances, we believe a phased approach can be employed to optimize full‑field development. A phased approach facilitates refinement of the development plans based on experience gained in initial phases of production and by leveraging existing infrastructure as subsequent phases of development are implemented. Production and reservoir performance from the initial phases are monitored closely to determine the most efficient and effective techniques to maximize the recovery of reserves and returns. Other benefits include minimizing upfront capital costs, reducing execution risks through smaller initial infrastructure requirements, and enabling cash flow from the initial phases of production to fund a portion of capital costs for subsequent phases. Our development of the Jubilee Field is an example of this approach. The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development is also being developed in a phased approach, consistent with our business strategy. This is anticipated to result in first gas approximately eight years after initial discovery. Finally, our approach to discoveries in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is to develop them via subsea tie-back to existing host facilities with spare capacity, which reduces development costs and the average timeline to first production. The Winterfell discovery (2021) and subsequent appraisal success (early 2022) is an example of this, with development expected to deliver first production in around two years.
Apply our entrepreneurial culture, which fosters innovation and creativity, to continue our successful exploration and development program
Our employees are critical to the success of our business strategy, and we have created an environment that enables them to focus their knowledge, skills and experience on finding, developing and producing new fields and optimizing production from existing fields. Culturally, we have an open, team‑oriented work environment that fosters entrepreneurial, creative and contrarian thinking. This approach enables us to fully consider and understand both risk and reward, as well as deliberately and collectively pursue ideas that create and maximize value and free cash flow. 
We are led by an experienced management team with a successful track record. Our management team members average over 25 years of industry experience and have participated in discovering and developing multiple large-scale upstream projects around the world. Our experience, industry relationships and technical expertise are our core competitive strengths and are crucial to our success.
Our returns focused exploration approach
Our exploration activity, which is deeply rooted in a fundamental, geologic approach, is focused on proven basins with high-graded infrastructure-led prospects and material play extension opportunities. We target specific areas with sufficient size to manage exploration risks and provide scale should the exploration concept prove successful. We also look for: (i) long‑term contract durations to enable the “right” exploration program to be executed, (ii) play type diversity to provide multiple exploration concept options, (iii) prospect dependency to enhance the chance of replicating success, and (iv) attractive fiscal terms to maximize the commercial viability of discovered hydrocarbons. Alongside the subsurface analysis, Kosmos gains a thorough understanding of the “above‑ground” dynamics in each of the countries in which we operate, which may influence a particular country’s relative desirability from an overall oil and natural gas operating and risk adjusted return perspective.
Our approach is aimed at areas where we have existing production and where there is sufficient infrastructure capacity to enable the development of new discoveries via subsea tieback. Acquisition of the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea and assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have added high-quality prospectivity to our inventory of infrastructure-led exploration opportunities given their attractive acreage positions within proximity of existing infrastructure with excess capacity available. Existing infrastructure allows us to shorten the time cycle from discovery to first production, lower the capital requirements and increase the returns.
Pursuing value accretive, opportunistic transactions that meet our strategic and financial objectives
Since 2017, we have completed three separate significant acquisitions of oil and natural gas producing properties for total value of approximately $2.0 billion dollars, as of the effective date of the acquisitions. These acquisitions were targeted to increase and complement our existing properties, providing production diversification while increasing the quality of investment opportunities in our portfolio. Our experienced team of management and technical professionals intend to continue 
identifying, evaluating and pursuing transactions involving oil and natural gas properties that are complementary to our core operating areas, as well as opportunities in other basins where we can apply our existing knowledge, expertise and relationships to create shareholder value. Our focus is on transactions where we can leverage our operational experience and expertise to provide productivity and cost improvements, invest in additional developmental opportunities in such assets and implement an infrastructure-led exploration program for nearby prospects.
Secure a premium license to operate through industry-leading ESG performance
We recognize that advancing the societies in which we work and operating in a manner that protects the environment is critical for creating long-term returns. We aim to continuously improve our ESG credentials by working with a range of stakeholders, including shareholders, partners, suppliers, host governments and civil society organizations.
We aim to act as a force for good by advancing the “Just Transition” in our host countries and communities – namely by supporting economic and social development in the places where we work while lowering emissions. We use the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to understand how our activities promote economic and social progress in host countries. Adopted in 2013, our Business Principles reflect our shared values as a company, define how we conduct our business and set the standards to which we hold ourselves accountable. Our Business Principles are supported by more detailed policies, procedures, and management systems. Each year, we report on our ESG approach and performance in our Sustainability Report and on our website.
Most recently, we have focused on evaluating the costs, benefits, risks, and opportunities that climate change and the global energy transition may present to our business and integrating them into our business strategy. As part of this effort, we established governance structures to monitor and manage climate-related risks and opportunities; developed a strategy to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations and mitigate remaining emissions through innovative nature-based solutions. We have published a Climate Risk and Resilience Report that adheres to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosure (“TCFD”). The report reviews how we are identifying and managing climate-related risks and opportunities across four categories: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets. In addition, the report sets forth our goal to achieve operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality by 2030 or sooner, a scenario analysis demonstrating the resilience of our portfolio under a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goals, and a description of innovative nature-based carbon capture projects used to mitigate emissions that cannot be eliminated.
Maintain financial discipline
Execution of our strategy requires us to maintain a conservative financial approach with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and a commitment to low leverage. As of December 31, 2021, our liquidity was approximately $770 million. 
Additionally, we use derivative instruments to partially limit our exposure to fluctuations in oil prices. We have an active commodity hedging program where we aim to hedge a portion of our anticipated sales volumes on a two to three year rolling basis, with the goal to protect against the downside price scenario while still retaining partial exposure to the upside. As of December 31, 2021, we have hedged positions covering approximately 12.5 million barrels of oil production in 2022. We also maintain insurance to partially protect against loss of production revenues from certain of our producing assets.
Operations by Geographic Area
We currently have operations in Africa and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Presently, our operating revenues are generated from our operations offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The following tables provide a summary of certain key 2021 data for our geographic areas.

Ghana
The WCTP Block and DT Block are located within the Tano Basin, offshore Ghana. This basin contains a proven world‑class petroleum system as evidenced by our discoveries. In October 2021, Kosmos completed the acquisition of Anadarko WCTP Company which owned a participating interest in the WCTP Block and DT Block offshore Ghana, including an 18.0% participating interest in the Jubilee Unit Area and an 11.1% participating interest in the TEN fields. Following closing of the acquisition, Kosmos’ interest in the Jubilee Unit Area increased from 24.1% to 42.1%, and Kosmos’ interest in the TEN fields increased from 17.0% to 28.1%. Under the Deepwater Tano Block Joint Operating Agreement, certain joint venture partners have pre-emption rights that, if fully exercised and approved by the Government of Ghana, could reduce our ultimate interest in the Jubilee Unit Area by 3.8% to 38.3%, and our ultimate interest in the TEN fields by 8.3% to 19.8%. In November 2021, we received notice from certain joint venture partners that they intend to exercise their pre-emption rights in relation to Kosmos' acquisition of Anadarko WCTP Company. The exercise of pre-emption rights is subject to finalizing definitive agreements with Kosmos and requires approval from GNPC and the Ghanaian Ministry of Energy. The following is a brief discussion of our discoveries on our license areas offshore Ghana.
Jubilee Field
The Jubilee Field was discovered by Kosmos in 2007, with first oil produced in 2010. Appraisal activities confirmed that the Jubilee discovery straddled the WCTP and DT Blocks. Pursuant to the terms of the Jubilee UUOA, the discovery area was unitized for purposes of joint development by the WCTP and DT Block partners. 
The Jubilee Field is located approximately 60 kilometers offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 1,000 to 1,800 meters, which led to the decision to implement an FPSO based development. The FPSO is designed to provide water and natural gas injection to support reservoir pressure, to process and store oil and to export gas through a pipeline to the mainland. The Jubilee Field is being developed in a phased approach. The initial phase provided subsea infrastructure capacity for additional production and injection wells to be drilled in future phases of development. 
The Government of Ghana completed the construction and connection of a gas pipeline in 2017 from the Jubilee Field to transport natural gas to the mainland for processing and sale. In 2021, the partnership exported approximately 85 million standard cubic feet per day (gross) on average from the Jubilee field to the mainland. In the absence of continuous export of large quantities of natural gas from the Jubilee Field, it is anticipated that we will need to re-inject or flare such natural gas. Our inability to continuously export associated natural gas from the Jubilee Field could impact our oil production.
In February 2016, the Jubilee Field operator identified an issue with the turret bearing of the FPSO Kwame Nkrumah. Kosmos and its partners completed the lifting and locking of the main turret bearing, and the rotation of the vessel to its final heading in the second half of 2018. Permanent spread mooring of the vessel was completed in 2019. The catenary anchor leg mooring (“CALM”) Buoy, the final phase of the turret remediation project, was installed and commissioned in February 2021.
Oil production from the Jubilee Field averaged approximately 74,900 Bopd gross (20,200 Bopd net) during 2021.
TEN
The TEN fields are located in the western and central portions of the DT Block, approximately 48 kilometers offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 1,000 to 1,700 meters. The discoveries are being jointly developed with shared infrastructure and a single FPSO, with first oil produced in 2016.
Similar to Jubilee, the TEN fields are being developed in a phased manner. The TEN PoD was designed to include an expandable subsea system that would provide for multiple phases. 
Oil production from TEN averaged approximately 32,800 Bopd gross (5,900 Bopd net) during 2021. 
The construction and connection of a gas pipeline between the Jubilee and TEN fields to transport natural gas to the mainland for processing and sale was completed in 2017. In December 2017, we signed the TAG GSA. In 2021, the partnership exported approximately 8 million standard cubic feet per day (gross) on average from the TEN field to the mainland. Our inability to continuously export associated natural gas from the TEN fields could impact our oil production.
U.S. Gulf of Mexico
    In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Kosmos maintains: (i) a portfolio of producing assets that Kosmos can continue to exploit, (ii) infrastructure-led exploration growth assets, and (iii) a high-quality inventory of exploration prospects across the Garden Banks, Green Canyon and Mississippi Canyon protraction areas. We have expanded our inventory through the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Federal lease sales and farm-in transactions, including expansion into the Walker Ridge, De Soto Canyon and Keathley Canyon protraction areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets averaged approximately 19,700 Boepd net (~ 82% oil) from 12 fields during 2021. 
The following is a brief discussion of our key producing fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Odd Job
The Odd Job field is producing through the Delta House FPS, operated by Murphy. The technical team initially identified the Middle Miocene sands at the Odd Job prospect, and these sands are currently producing. The Odd Job 214 #2 well, the third well in the Odd Job field, was drilled in 2018, and came online in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net production during 2021 averaged approximately 6,500 Boepd net. 
Tornado
The Tornado field is producing from three Pliocene wells through the Helix Producer I, a ship-shaped, dynamically-positioned production platform in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is operated by Talos Energy. To help enhance overall recoveries in the Tornado field, the Tornado 4 water injection well was drilled and came online in 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, the Tornado 5 infill well was successfully drilled and completed. The Tornado 5 well was brought online in July 2021. Net production during 2021 averaged approximately 5,800 Boepd net. 
Kodiak
The Kodiak field is producing from one well, which is completed in the Middle Miocene sands. This well is flowing through the Devils Tower Spar platform, which is operated by ENI. In April 2021, a second development well was brought online through existing infrastructure to the Devils Tower Spar platform with one of two zones intermittently producing. During the third quarter of 2021, the well continued to experience production issues and was shut-in. We have agreed with partners to side-track the well in the first half of 2022 to restore production from the second Kodiak development well. Net production during 2021 averaged approximately 2,700 Boepd net. 
Marmalard
The Marmalard field produces from four wells, each completed in Middle Miocene sands. These wells are flowing through the Delta House FPS, operated by Murphy. Net production during 2021 averaged approximately 1,800 Boepd net. 
South Santa Cruz / Barataria
The South Santa Cruz field is producing from one well in a Late Miocene sand. The Barataria field is also producing from one well in a Late Miocene sand. Both fields produce through the Blind Faith semi-submersible platform, which is operated by Chevron. Net production from these two wells during 2021 averaged approximately 900 Boepd net.
Mauritania
The C8 and C12 blocks are located on the western margin of the Mauritania Salt Basin offshore Mauritania and range in water depths from 100 to 3,000 meters. These blocks are located in a proven petroleum system, with our primary targets being Cretaceous sands in structural and stratigraphic traps. 
These blocks cover an aggregate area of approximately 2.4 million acres (gross). We have acquired approximately 2,500 line-kilometers of 2D seismic data and 9,600 square kilometers of 3D seismic data covering portions of our blocks in Mauritania. Based on these 2D and 3D seismic programs, we have drilled three successful exploration wells and an appraisal well and have identified additional prospects in our blocks. We continue to integrate the results of our drilling program in Mauritania. In 2021, at the conclusion of the second exploration period, Block C13 offshore Mauritania was relinquished.
Senegal
The Senegal Blocks are located in the Senegal River Cretaceous petroleum system and range in water depth from 300 to 3,100 meters. The area is an extension of the working petroleum system in the Mauritania Salt Basin. We acquired approximately 3,700 square kilometers of 3D seismic data over the Senegal Blocks in 2015 and 2016. We have drilled three successful exploration wells and two appraisal wells. 
The following is a brief discussion of our discoveries to date offshore Mauritania and Senegal.
Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Development
The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim discoveries are significant, play-opening gas discoveries for the outboard Cretaceous petroleum system and are located approximately 120 kilometers offshore Mauritania and Senegal. The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development straddles Block C8 offshore Mauritania and Saint Louis Offshore Profond Block offshore Senegal.
We have drilled four wells within the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development, Tortue-1, Guembeul-1, Ahmeyim-2 and Greater Tortue Ahmeyim-1 (GTA-1). The wells penetrated multiple, excellent quality gas reservoirs, including the Lower Cenomanian, Upper Cenomanian and underlying Albian. The wells successfully delineated the Ahmeyim and Guembeul gas discoveries and demonstrated reservoir continuity, as well as static pressure communication between the three wells drilled within the Lower Cenomanian reservoir. The discovery ranges in water depths from approximately 2,700 meters to 2,800 meters, with total depths drilled ranging from approximately 5,100 meters to 5,250 meters.
The Tortue-1 discovery well, located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, intersected approximately 117 meters of net hydrocarbon pay. A single gas pool was encountered in the Lower Cenomanian objective, which is comprised of three reservoirs totaling 88 meters in thickness over a gross hydrocarbon interval of 160 meters. A fourth reservoir totaling 19 meters was penetrated within the Upper Cenomanian target over a gross hydrocarbon interval of 150 meters. The exploration well also intersected an additional 10 meters of net hydrocarbon pay in the lower Albian section, which is interpreted to be gas.
The Guembeul-1 discovery well, located in the northern part of the Saint Louis Offshore Profond area in Senegal, is located approximately five kilometers south of the Tortue-1 exploration well in Mauritania. The well encountered 101 meters of net gas pay in two excellent quality reservoirs, including 56 meters in the Lower Cenomanian and 45 meters in the underlying Albian, with no water encountered.
The Ahmeyim-2 appraisal well is located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, approximately five kilometers northwest, and 200 meters down-dip of the basin-opening Tortue-1 discovery. The well confirmed significant thickening of the gross reservoir sequences down-dip. The Ahmeyim-2 well encountered 78 meters of net gas pay in two excellent quality reservoirs, including 46 meters in the Lower Cenomanian and 32 meters in the underlying Albian. 
The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim-1 (GTA-1) appraisal well was drilled on the eastern anticline within the unit development area of Greater Tortue Ahmeyim field. The GTA-1 well encountered approximately 30 meters of net gas pay in high quality Albian reservoir. The well was drilled in approximately 2,500 meters of water, approximately 10 kilometers inboard of the Guembeul-1A and Tortue-1 wells, to a total depth of 4,884 meters. 
In 2017, we completed a DST on the Tortue-1 well, demonstrating that the Tortue field is a world-class resource and confirming key development parameters including well deliverability, reservoir connectivity, and fluid composition. The Tortue-1 well flowed at a sustained, equipment-constrained rate of approximately 60 MMcfd during the main extended flow period, with minimal pressure drawdown, providing confidence in well designs that are each capable of producing approximately 200 MMcfd. The DST results confirmed a connected volume per well consistent with the current development scheme, which together with the high well rate is expected to result in a low number of development wells compared to equivalent schemes. Initial analysis of fluid samples collected during the test indicate Tortue gas is well suited for liquefaction given low levels of liquids and minimal impurities. Data acquired from the DST was used to further optimize field development and to refine process design parameters critical to the FEED process.
In December 2018, we and our partners announced that a final investment decision for Phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project had been agreed. The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project is designed to produce gas from a deepwater subsea system to a mid-water FPSO, which processes the gas to make it liquefaction ready, and sends the gas through a pipeline to a FLNG facility. The FLNG facility is protected behind a nearshore hub (which serves as a breakwater and LNG terminal) and is located on the Mauritania and Senegal maritime border. The FLNG facility for Phase 1 is designed to produce approximately 2.5 million tons per annum on average. The project will provide LNG for global export, as well as make gas available for 
domestic use in both Mauritania and Senegal. Following a competitive tender process, BP Gas Marketing was selected as the buyer for the LNG offtake for Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Phase 1, and the Tortue Phase 1 SPA was executed in February 2020 with an initial term of up to 20 years. Phase 1 of the project was approximately 70% complete at year-end 2021, with first gas for the project expected in the third quarter of 2023. The partnership has also been focused on optimizing Phase 2 of the project to deliver competitive returns in the current environment. Phase 2 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project targets an expansion largely utilizing the infrastructure from Phase 1. 
Other Mauritania and Senegal Discoveries
BirAllah and Orca Discoveries
The BirAllah discovery (formally known as Marsouin), located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, is a significant, play-extending gas discovery, building on our successful exploration program in the outboard Cretaceous petroleum system offshore Mauritania. The Marsouin-1 well is located approximately 60 kilometers north of the Ahmeyim discovery and was drilled to a total depth of 5,150 meters in nearly 2,400 meters of water. Based on analysis of drilling results and logging data, Marsouin-1 encountered at least 70 meters of net gas pay in Upper and Lower Cenomanian intervals comprised of excellent quality reservoir sands. 
The Orca-1 well, located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, was drilled in October 2019 and delivered a major gas discovery. The Orca-1 well, which targeted a previously untested Albian play, encountered 36 meters of net gas pay in excellent quality reservoirs. In addition, the well extended the Cenomanian play fairway by confirming 11 meters of net gas pay in a down-structure position relative to the original Marsouin-1 discovery well. The location of the Orca-1 well proved both the structural and stratigraphic components of the trap are working, thereby proving a significant volume. The Orca-1 well was drilled in approximately 2,510 meters of water to a total measured depth of around 5,266 meters.
In total, we believe that Orca-1 and Marsouin-1 have de-risked more than sufficient resource to support a world-scale LNG project from the Cenomanian and Albian plays in the BirAllah area. The BirAllah and Orca discoveries are being analyzed as a potential joint development. We are currently in discussions with the government of Mauritania to extend the exploration phase of Block C8 which is currently set to expire in June 2022. As of December 31, 2021, capitalized costs related to BirAllah and Orca discoveries approximates $62.0 million.
Yakaar and Teranga Discoveries
The Teranga discovery is located in the Cayar Offshore Profond block approximately 65 kilometers northwest of Dakar and was our second exploration well offshore Senegal. The Teranga-1 discovery well is located in nearly 1,800 meters of water and was drilled to a total depth of approximately 4,850 meters. The well encountered 31 meters of net gas pay in good quality reservoir in the Lower Cenomanian objective. Well results confirm that a prolific inboard gas fairway extends approximately 200 kilometers south from the Marsouin-1 well in Mauritania through the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim area on the maritime boundary to the Teranga-1 well in Senegal.
The Yakaar discovery is located in the Cayar Offshore Profond block offshore Senegal, approximately 95 kilometers northwest of Dakar in approximately 2,600 meters of water. The Yakaar-1 discovery well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 4,900 meters. The well intersected a gross hydrocarbon column of 120 meters in three pools within the primary Lower Cenomanian objective and encountered 45 meters of net pay. In September 2019, we completed the Yakaar-2 appraisal well, which encountered approximately 30 meters of net gas pay. The Yakaar-2 well was drilled approximately nine kilometers from the Yakaar-1 exploration well and further delineated the southern extension of the field. 
The results of the Yakaar-2 well underpin our view that the Yakaar-Teranga resource base is world-scale and has the potential to support an LNG project that provides significant volumes of natural gas to both domestic and export markets. Development of Yakaar-Teranga is being considered in a phased approach with Phase 1 providing domestic gas and data to optimize the development of future phases. It could also support the country’s “Plan Emergent Senegal” launched by the President of Senegal in 2014.
Equatorial Guinea
The EG-21, EG-24, S, and W blocks are located in the southern part of the Gulf of Guinea, in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, west of the Rio Muni petroleum province with water depths up to 2,300 meters. These blocks are located in a proven petroleum system, with our primary targets being Cretaceous sands in structural and stratigraphic traps. We have over 
10,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic over the blocks. The seismic data is being interpreted and high graded prospects for future drilling are being matured. 
Ceiba Field and Okume Complex 
In Equatorial Guinea, we maintain a 40.4% undivided participating interest in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. These offshore assets in the Gulf of Guinea provide cash flow through production with the potential to increase production through exploration opportunities with potential low cost tie-backs through the existing infrastructure. 
The shared development of the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex consists of six subsea-well clusters that feed production to the Ceiba FPSO which is shared by both fields through a system of risers. The Okume Complex includes six platforms with an export line to move Okume production to the Ceiba FPSO.
Oil production from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex averaged approximately 29,900 Bopd gross (9,700 Bopd net) during 2021. 
Asam Discovery
In October 2019, the S-5 exploration well was drilled to a total depth of 4,400 meters in Block S offshore Equatorial Guinea, encountering 39 meters of net oil pay in good-quality Santonian reservoir. In July 2020, an appraisal plan was approved by the government of Equatorial Guinea. The well is located within tieback range of the Ceiba FPSO and the appraisal program is currently ongoing to establish the scale of the discovered resource and evaluate the optimum development solution. 
Sao Tome and Principe
We are the operator for the petroleum contract covering Block 5, offshore Sao Tome and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea. The block covers an area of approximately 0.5 million acres (gross) in water depths ranging from 2,150 to 3,000 meters.
Our block is adjacent to, and represents a potential extension of, a proven and prolific petroleum system offshore Equatorial Guinea and northern Gabon comprising Cretaceous post-rift source rocks and Late Cretaceous reservoirs.
In August 2017, we completed a 3D seismic survey of approximately 2,500 square kilometers offshore Sao Tome and Principe. Processing has been completed and the 3D seismic data has been integrated into our geological evaluation. We continue to mature an inventory of prospects on the license area in Sao Tome and Principe and will continue to refine and assess the prospectivity. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received approval for a six month extension to the current exploration phase for Block 5 offshore Sao Tome and Principe through November 2022.

These reserves also include the estimated quantities of fuel gas required to operate the Jubilee and TEN FPSOs and Equatorial Guinea facilities during normal field operations and the associated gas forecasted to be exported from TEN. If and when a subsequent gas sales agreement is executed for Jubilee, a portion of the remaining Jubilee gas may be recognized as reserves. If and when a gas sales agreement and the related infrastructure are in place for the TEN fields non-associated gas, a portion of the remaining gas may be recognized as reserves. 
(4)The Mauritania/Senegal Natural Gas reserves presented consists of LNG and Fuel Gas in our reserve report. We note that the LNG is presented as Plant Products in Mboe in our reserve report.
(5)All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within six years or less. Proved undeveloped reserves expected to be developed beyond five years are related to long-term projects which will be completed under a continuous drilling program.
Changes during the year ended December 31, 2021, at Greater Jubilee include a positive revision of 49.1 MMBoe, of which 39.9 MMBoe were acquired on October 13, 2021 in the recent acquisition of additional interests in Ghana. The other 9.2 MMBoe of additions were primarily due to field performance, positive drilling results, and optimization of future development plans. The additions were partially offset by net Greater Jubilee production of 7.4 MMBoe which includes production related to our acquisition of additional interests in Ghana commencing October 13, 2021, the acquisition date. Changes at TEN include a positive revision of 18.2 MMBoe, of which 16.2 MMBoe were acquired in the recent acquisition of additional interests in Ghana. The other 2.0 MMBoe of additions were primarily due to an increase in estimated associated gas sales. The additions were partially offset by net TEN production of 2.2 MMBoe. Changes at Equatorial Guinea included an increase of 3.7 MMBoe related to Okume Complex performance and drilling results, which was offset by 3.6 MMBoe of net production. Changes at the U.S. Gulf of Mexico included an increase of 4.4 MMBoe related to strong performance of certain fields, offset by net U.S. Gulf of Mexico production of 7.2 MMBoe.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had an overall proved undeveloped reserves increase of 136.3 MMBoe as a result of several factors, including the acquisition of additional interests in Ghana (+22.7 MMBoe for Greater Jubilee and 
+6.6 MMBoe for TEN), optimization of future drilling in Greater Jubilee (+17.8 MMBoe), adding a future development well and optimizing future development plans in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea (+6.8 MMBoe), and the economic status of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project due to project progress and improved oil price (+106.5 MMBoe). Drilling activity impact on proved undeveloped volume change includes the drilling of two wells in Greater Jubilee (-17.1 MMBoe), one well in TEN (-3.6 MMBoe), two wells in Equatorial Guinea (-1.2 MMBoe), and one well in Tornado in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (-2.1 MMBoe).
In Greater Jubilee, we converted 17.1 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed with the drilling of two wells at a cost of $25.2 million. In TEN, we converted 3.6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves with the drilling of one well at a cost of $8.9 million. In Equatorial Guinea we spent $35.6 million to drill two wells and to replace certain subsea infrastructure, which converted 1.8 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we converted 2.1 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed with the drilling of one well in Tornado at a cost of $19.0 million.
Changes during the year ended December 31, 2020, were primarily due to 2020 production as well as lower prices. Greater Jubilee includes a negative revision of 0.3 MMBbl related to delayed drilling of water injection wells that will provide needed pressure support to certain production wells, in addition to net Greater Jubilee production of 7.0 MMBbl. Changes at TEN included a decrease of 12.0 MMBbl related to performance, delayed drilling and alterations to future development plans, in addition to net TEN production of 2.9 MMBoe. Changes at Equatorial Guinea included an increase of 2.0 MMBbl due to strong base performance and positive stimulation results, offset by 4.0 MMBbl of net Equatorial Guinea production. Changes at the U.S. Gulf of Mexico included an increase of 2.0 MMBoe primarily due to positive drilling and performance at Kodiak and Tornado, offset by net U.S. Gulf of Mexico production of 8.3 MMBoe.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had an overall proved undeveloped reserves decrease of 3.3 MMboe as a result of several factors, including adding additional wells to future development of Greater Jubilee (+4.7 MMboe), a negative revision in TEN (-0.3 MMboe), drilling of one well in TEN (-3.0 MMboe), one well in the Kodiak field (-1.6 MMboe) and one well in the Tornado field (-0.9 MMboe), and loss due to lower SEC pricing (-2.2 MMboe).
In TEN, we converted 3.0 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed with the drilling of a new well, at a cost of $28.5 million. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we spent $79.2 million to drill two new wells, which converted 2.5 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed.
The Tortue Phase 1 SPA was signed on February 11, 2020, resulting in approximately 100 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves being recognized at that time as evaluated by the Company's independent reserve auditor, Ryder Scott, LP. Due to the decrease in commodity prices during 2020 and the related commodity price utilized to calculate proved reserves for SEC purposes, the field did not have proved reserves recognition as of December 31, 2020.
Changes during the year ended December 31, 2019, at Greater Jubilee include a positive revision of 8.2 MMBbl related to positive drilling results and increased original oil in place, and optimized development plan, partially offset by net Greater Jubilee production of 7.6 MMBbl. Changes at TEN included an increase of 8.8 MMBoe related to original oil in place adjustments based on updated static modeling and development plan updates, partially offset by net TEN production of 3.8 MMBoe. Changes at Equatorial Guinea included an increase of 6.3 MMBbl due to production optimization plans and plans for new drilling, which was offset by 4.7 MMBbl of net production. Changes at the U.S. Gulf of Mexico included an increase of 2.9 MMBoe related to strong performance of certain fields and the Gladden Deep discovery, offset by net U.S. Gulf of Mexico production of 8.8 MMBoe.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had an addition of 16.1 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as a result of several factors, including updated original oil in place due to positive drilling results and improved static models in Greater Jubilee and TEN, plans for one new well to be drilled in TEN and three new wells to be drilled in the Okume Complex.
We converted a total of 13.7 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed due to completions of three new wells in Greater Jubilee, two new wells in TEN, and three new wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with a combined cost of $176.7 million. We spent $41.6 million to convert 4.0 MMBbl of proved undeveloped reserves in Greater Jubilee and $12.8 million to convert 2.5 MMBoe proved undeveloped reserves in TEN; and $122.3 million spent to convert 7.2 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Estimated proved reserves
Unless otherwise specifically identified in this report, the summary data with respect to our estimated net proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 has been prepared by RSC, our independent reserve engineering firm for such years, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. These rules require SEC reporting companies to prepare their reserve estimates using reserve definitions and pricing based on 12‑month historical unweighted first‑day‑of‑the‑month average prices, rather than year‑end prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, see the “Glossary and Selected Abbreviations.” For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see “—Independent petroleum engineers” below.
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV‑10 and Standardized Measure were determined in accordance with SEC rules for proved reserves.
Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). Such calculations at December 31, 2021 are based on costs in effect at December 31, 2021 and the 12‑month unweighted arithmetic average of the first‑day‑of‑the‑month price for the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted for anticipated market premium, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and are held constant throughout the life of the assets. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or prices and costs will remain constant.
Independent petroleum engineers
Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
RSC, our independent reserve engineers for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was established in 1937. For over 80 years, RSC has provided services to the worldwide petroleum industry that include the issuance of reserves reports and audits, appraisal of oil and gas properties including fair market value determination, reservoir simulation studies, enhanced recovery services, expert witness testimony, and management advisory services. RSC professionals subscribe to a code of professional conduct and RSC is a Registered Engineering Firm in the State of Texas.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we engaged RSC to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves of certain of our oil and gas properties. These reports were prepared at our request to estimate our reserves and related future net revenues and PV‑10 for the periods indicated therein. Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and related future net revenues and PV‑10 at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are taken from reports prepared by RSC, in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles which RSC believes are commonly used in the industry and definitions and current regulations established by the SEC. The December 31, 2021 reserve report was completed on January 21, 2022, and a copy is included as an exhibit to this report.
In connection with the preparation of the December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 reserves report, RSC prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In the process of the reserves evaluation, RSC did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of RSC which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, RSC did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. RSC independently prepared reserves estimates to conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4‑10(a)(2) of Regulation S‑X. RSC issued a report on our proved reserves at December 31, 2021, based upon its evaluation. RSC’s primary economic assumptions in estimates included an ability to sell hydrocarbons at their respective adjusted benchmark prices and certain levels of future capital expenditures. The assumptions, data, methods and precedents were appropriate for the purpose served by these reports, and RSC used all methods and procedures as it considered necessary under the circumstances to prepare the report.
Technology used to establish proved reserves
Under the SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have proved effective by actual comparison of production from projects in the same reservoir interval, an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, RSC employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production and injection data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, acoustic logs, whole core analysis, sidewall core analysis, downhole pressure and temperature measurements, reservoir fluid samples, geochemical information, geologic maps, seismic data, well test and interference pressure and rate data. Reserves attributable to undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells with similar geologic depositional environments, rock quality, appraisal plans and development plans to assess the estimated ultimate recoverable reserves as a function of the original oil in place. These qualitative measures are benchmarked and validated against sound petroleum reservoir engineering principles and equations to estimate the ultimate recoverable reserves volume. These techniques include, but are not limited to, nodal analysis, material balance, and numerical flow simulation.
Internal controls over reserves estimation process
In our Reservoir Engineering team, we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineering and geoscience professionals with significant experience that contribute to our internal reserve and resource estimates. This team works closely with our independent petroleum engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished in their reserve and resource estimation process. Our Reservoir Engineering team is responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates and has over 100 combined years of industry experience among them with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. Each member of our team holds a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering or geology.
The RSC technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the RSC reserves report incorporated herein is Mr. Tosin Famurewa. Mr. Famurewa has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at RSC since 2006. Mr. Famurewa is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 100569) and has over 19 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering. He graduated from University of California at Berkeley in 2000 with Bachelor of Science Degrees in Chemical Engineering and Material Science Engineering, and he received a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from University of Southern California in 2007. Mr. Famurewa meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
The Audit Committee provides oversight on the processes utilized in the development of our internal reserve and resource estimates on an annual basis. In addition, our Reservoir Engineering team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review our assets and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the reserve and resource estimates. Finally, our senior management reviews reserve and resource estimates on an annual basis.

Domestic Supply Requirements
Many of our petroleum contracts or, in some cases, the applicable law governing such agreements, grant a right to the respective host country to purchase certain amounts of oil/gas produced pursuant to such agreements at international market prices for domestic consumption. In addition, in connection with the approval of the Jubilee Phase 1 PoD, the Jubilee Field partners agreed to provide the first 200 Bcf of natural gas produced from the Jubilee Field Phase 1 development to GNPC at no cost. As of December 31, 2021, 159 Bcf of the 200 Bcf of natural gas has been provided.
Significant License Agreements
Below is a discussion concerning the petroleum contracts governing our current drilling and production operations.
Ghana West Cape Three Points Block
As a result of the approval of the GJFFDP by the Ghana Ministry of Energy in 2017, operatorship for the West Cape Three Points Block, including the Mahogany and Teak discoveries, transferred to Tullow in February 2018 and are now included in the Jubilee Unit. Kosmos is required to pay to the government of Ghana a fixed royalty of 5% and a potential sliding‑scale royalty (“additional oil entitlement”), which comes into effect and escalates as the nominal project rate of return increases above a certain threshold. These royalties are to be paid in‑kind or, at the election of the government of Ghana, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 35% is applied to profits at a country level.
The WCTP petroleum contract has a duration of 30 years from its effective date (July 2004). In July 2011, at the end of the seven‑year Exploration Period, parts of the WCTP Block on which we had not declared a discovery area, were not in a development and production area, or were not in the Jubilee Unit, were relinquished (“WCTP Relinquishment Area”). We maintain rights to the Akasa discovery within the WCTP Block as the WCTP petroleum contract remains in effect after the end of the Exploration Period. We and our WCTP Block partners have certain rights to negotiate a new petroleum contract with respect to certain portions of the WCTP Relinquishment Area. We and our WCTP Block partners, the Ghana Ministry of Energy and GNPC have agreed such WCTP petroleum contract rights to negotiate extend from July 21, 2011 until such time as 
either a new petroleum contract is negotiated and entered into with us or we decline to match a bona fide third-party offer GNPC may receive for the WCTP Relinquishment Area.
Ghana Deepwater Tano Block
Tullow is the operator of the Deepwater Tano Block. Under the DT petroleum contract, GNPC exercised its option to acquire an additional paying interest of 5% in the commercial discovery with respect to the Jubilee Field development and the TEN Fields development. Kosmos is required to pay to the government of Ghana a fixed royalty of 5% and a potential additional oil entitlement, which comes into effect and escalates as the nominal project rate of return increases above a certain threshold. These royalties are to be paid in‑kind or, at the election of the government of Ghana, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 35% is applied to profits at a country level.
The DT petroleum contract has a duration of 30 years from its effective date (July 2006). In 2013, at the end of the seven‑year Exploration Period, parts of the DT Block on which we had not declared a discovery area, were not in a development and production area, or were not in the Jubilee Unit, were relinquished (“DT Relinquishment Area”). Our existing Wawa discovery within the DT Block was not subject to relinquishment upon expiration of the Exploration Period of the DT petroleum contract, as the DT petroleum contract remains in effect after the end of the Exploration Period while commerciality is being determined. Pursuant to our DT petroleum contract, we and our DT Block partners have certain rights to negotiate a new petroleum contract with respect to certain portions of the DT Relinquishment Area until such time as either a new petroleum contract is negotiated and entered into with us or we decline to match a bona fide third-party offer GNPC may receive for the DT Relinquishment Area.
The Ghanaian Petroleum Exploration and Production Law of 1984 (PNDCL 84) (the “1984 Ghanaian Petroleum Law”) and the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts form the basis of our exploration, development and production operations on the WCTP and DT blocks. Pursuant to these petroleum contracts, most significant decisions, including PoDs and annual work programs, for operations other than exploration and appraisal, must be approved by a joint management committee, consisting of representatives of certain block partners and GNPC. Certain decisions require unanimity.
Ghana Jubilee Field Unitization
The Jubilee Field, discovered by the Mahogany‑1 well in June 2007, covers an area within both the WCTP and DT Blocks. To optimize resource recovery in the Jubilee Field, it was unitized and the Jubilee UUOA was agreed to in 2009 which governs each party’s respective rights and duties in the Jubilee Unit and named Tullow as the Unit Operator. Although the Jubilee Field is unitized, Kosmos’ participating interests in each block outside the boundary of the Jubilee Unit are not impacted by the Jubilee UUOA. Currently, the WCTP petroleum contract has a 54.367% participating interest in the Jubilee Unit and the DT petroleum contract has a 45.633% participating interest in the Jubilee Unit. Our participating interest in the Jubilee Unit is based on these allocations and any event of redetermination in the future would impact Jubilee Unit participating interest. 
Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unitization
The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field, discovered by the Tortue‑1 well in May 2015, in Mauritania block C8 and by the Guembuel-1 well in January 2016, in the Saint-Louis Offshore Profond Block in Senegal covers an area within both the C8 and Saint-Louis Offshore Profond Blocks. Mauritania and Senegal agreed that the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field would be unitized for optimal resource recovery in the Inter-State Cooperation Agreement (ICA) signed in February 2018. The GTA UUOA was agreed between the contractor groups of the C8 and Saint-Louis Offshore Profond Blocks and approved by the appropriate Ministers in Mauritania and Senegal in February 2019. BP Mauritania and BP Senegal are co-Unit Operator and will allocate responsibilities for the initial development of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field. During the second quarter of 2019, SMH and PETROSEN elected to increase their respective interest in their portion of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit to the maximum allowed percentages under the respective petroleum contracts. After the election, our interest in the exploration areas of Block C8 offshore Mauritania and in Saint Louis Offshore Profound offshore Senegal are unchanged, however, our interest in the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit is now 26.7% and is subject to redetermination of the participating interests pursuant to the terms of the GTA UUOA. In February 2019, Mauritania and Senegal each issued an exploitation authorization for the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Unit area covered by the GTA UUOA. 
Mauritania Agreements
Effective June 2012, we entered into three petroleum contracts covering offshore Mauritania Blocks C8, C12 and C13 with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. The Mauritanian national oil company, SMH, currently has a 10% carried interest during the exploration period only. Should a commercial discovery be made, SMH’s 10% carried interest is extinguished and 
SMH will have an option to obtain a participating interest between 10% and 14%. SMH will pay its portion of development and production costs in a commercial development. Cost recovery oil is apportioned to the contractor from up to 55% (62% for gas) of total production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Mauritania and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon “R‑factor” tranches, where the R‑factor is cumulative net revenues divided by the cumulative investment. At the election of the government of Mauritania, the government may receive its share of production in cash or in kind. A corporate tax rate of 27% is applied to profits at the license level. The terms of exploration periods of these Offshore Blocks are all ten years and initially included a first exploration period of four years followed by the second exploration period of three years and the third exploration period of three years. Kosmos is currently in the third exploration period for Blocks C8 and C12, expiring in June 2022. In 2021, at the conclusion of the second exploration period, Block C13 offshore Mauritania was relinquished.
Senegal Agreements
In June 2018, we entered the final renewal of the exploration period for the Senegal Cayar Offshore Profond and Saint Louis Offshore Profond Blocks. In July 2021, the term of the Cayar Offshore Profound license was extended for up to an additional three years, ending in July 2024. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended on two separate occasions for a period of 10 years each under certain circumstances. The exploration period of the St. Louis Offshore Profound license expired in July 2021.
Equatorial Guinea Exploration Agreements
In March 2018, we entered into petroleum contracts covering Blocks EG-21, S, and W with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. The Equatorial Guinean national oil company, GEPetrol, currently has a 20% carried participating interest during the exploration period. Should a commercial discovery be made, GEPetrol's 20% carried interest will convert to a 20% participating interest. The petroleum contracts cover approximately 6,000 square kilometers, with a first exploration sub-period ending in March 2021. In August 2020, an extension was granted extending the first exploration sub-period ending to December 2022. 
 In the first quarter of 2019, we became operator of Block EG-24 offshore Equatorial Guinea. GEPetrol, currently has a 20% carried interest during the exploration period. In March 2020, we entered the first extension period ending in March 2021. In August 2020, an extension was granted extending the first extension period to December 2022. The petroleum contract cover covers approximately 3,500 square kilometers. Should a commercial discovery be made, GEPetrol's 20% carried interest will convert to a 20% participating interest for all development and production operations. 
Sales and Marketing
As provided under the Jubilee UUOA and the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts, we are entitled to lift and sell our share of the Jubilee and TEN production as are the other Jubilee Unit and TEN partners. Over the years, we have entered into agreements with multiple oil marketing agents to market our share of the Jubilee and TEN fields oil, and we approve the terms of each sale proposed by such agent. We currently have crude oil marketing sales agreements over the Jubilee and TEN fields extending approximately three years.
In December 2017, we signed the TAG GSA and we began exporting TEN associated gas to shore in the fourth quarter of 2018. The TAG GSA provides for an inflation-adjusted sales price of $0.50 per MMBtu.
In Equatorial Guinea, as provided under the petroleum contract for Block G, we are entitled to lift and sell our share of the Ceiba Field production as are the other Ceiba Field partners. We have entered into an agreement with an oil marketing agent to market our share of the Ceiba Field oil, and we approve the terms of each sale proposed by such agent.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we sell crude oil to purchasers typically through monthly contracts, with the sale taking place at multiple points offshore, depending on the particular property. Natural gas is sold to purchasers through monthly contracts, with the sale taking place either offshore or at an onshore gas processing plant after the removal of NGLs. We actively market our crude oil and natural gas to purchasers, and sales prices for purchased oil and natural gas volumes are negotiated with purchasers and are based on certain published indices. Since most of the oil and natural gas contracts are generally month-to-month, there are very few dedications of production to any one purchaser. We sell the NGLs entrained in the natural gas that we produce. The arrangements to sell these products first requires natural gas to be processed at an onshore gas processing plant. Once the liquids are removed and fractionated (separated into the individual hydrocarbon chains for sale), the products are sold by the processing plant. The residue gas left over is sold to natural gas purchasers as natural gas sales 
(referenced above). The contracts for NGL sales are with the processing plant. The prices received for the NGLs are either tied to indices or are based on what the processing plant can receive from a third-party purchaser. The gas processing and subsequent sales of NGLs are subject to contracts with longer terms and dedications of life of lease production from the Company’s leases offshore.
There are a variety of factors which affect the market for oil, including the proximity and capacity of transportation facilities, demand for oil both within the local market and beyond, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of government regulations on oil production and sales. Our revenue can be materially affected by current economic conditions and the price of oil. However, based on the current demand for crude oil and the fact that alternative purchasers are available, we believe that the loss of our marketing agent and/or any of the purchasers identified by our marketing agent would not have a long‑term material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. The continued economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could further materially impact the Company’s business in future periods. Any potential disruption will depend on the duration and intensity of these events, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. 
In February 2020, we, along with the co-venturers in the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field signed the Tortue Phase 1 SPA with BP Gas Marketing Limited to sell LNG free on board (FOB) from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field located offshore Mauritania and Senegal. The annual contract quantity under the Tortue Phase 1 SPA is 127,951,000 MMBtu (the “ACQ”) which is equivalent to approximately 2.45 million tonnes per annum, subject to limited downward adjustment by the sellers. The sales price for LNG under the Tortue Phase 1 SPA is set as a percentage of a crude oil price benchmark for the ACQ volumes (the “ACQ Sales Price”). The Tortue Phase 1 SPA has an initial term of up to twenty years that commences on the “Commercial Operations Date”, which occurs after completion of certain LNG project facilities’ performance tests.
Competition
The oil and gas industry is competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring licenses and leases. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff that are substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable oil and natural gas assets, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of licenses and leases than our financial or personnel resources will permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of lower commodity prices, unsuccessful wells, volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry‑wide economic conditions. These companies may also be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which may adversely affect our competitive position.
Historically, we have also been affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. Higher commodity prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs, supplies, services, equipment and crews. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced drilling crews and equipment and services may restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct our operations.
The oil and gas industry as a whole has experienced continued volatility. Globally, the impact of COVID-19 has impacted demand for oil, which also resulted in significant variations in oil prices. Dated Brent crude, the benchmark for our international oil sales, ranged from approximately $50 to $86 per barrel during 2021. HLS crude, the benchmark for our U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil sales, which generally trades at a discount to Dated Brent, ranged from approximately $50 to $84 during 2021. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realized price for 2021 was $70.10 per barrel. 
Title to Property
We believe that we have satisfactory title to our oil and natural gas assets in accordance with standards generally accepted in the international oil and gas industry. Our licenses and leases are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens under operating agreements and other burdens, restrictions and encumbrances customary in the oil and gas industry that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of, or affect the carrying value of, our interests.
Environmental Matters
General
We are subject to various stringent and complex international, foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing matters including the emission and discharge of pollutants into the ground, air or 
water; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of regulated materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
•require the acquisition of various permits before operations commence or for operations to continue;
•enjoin some or all of the operations or facilities deemed not in compliance with permits;
•restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;
•limit, cap, tax or otherwise restrict emissions of GHG and other air pollutants or otherwise seek to address or minimize the effects of climate change;
•limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain locations lying within protected or otherwise sensitive areas; and
•require measures to mitigate or remediate pollution, including pollution resulting from our block partners’ or our contractors’ operations.
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. Compliance with these laws can be costly; the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. We are committed to continued compliance with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established policies, operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our operations and to identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations, however the cost of compliance with more stringent laws and regulations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment continues to increase. Offshore drilling in some areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in other areas, has been restricted. Our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws or regulations are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts offshore drilling or imposes environmental requirements that increase costs to the oil and gas industry in general, such as more stringent or costly waste handling, disposal or cleanup requirements or financial responsibility and assurance requirements.
Per common industry practice, under agreements governing the terms of use of the drilling rigs contracted by us or our block or lease partners, the drilling rig contractors typically indemnify us and our block partners in respect of pollution and environmental damage originating above the surface of the water and from such drilling rig contractor’s property, including their drilling rig and other related equipment. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements for our blocks and leases, except in certain circumstances, each block or lease partner is responsible for its share of liabilities in proportion to its participating interest incurred as a result of pollution and environmental damage, containment and clean‑up activities, loss or damage to any well, loss of oil or natural gas resulting from a blowout, crater, fire, or uncontrolled well, loss of stored oil and natural gas, as well as for plugging or bringing under control any well. We maintain insurance coverage typical of the industry in the areas we operate in; these include property damage insurance, loss of production insurance, wreck removal insurance, control of well insurance, general liability including pollution liability to cover pollution from wells and other operations. We also participate in an insurance coverage program for the FPSOs which we own. We believe our insurance is carried in amounts typical for the industry relative to our size and operations and in accordance with our contractual and regulatory obligations.
Capping and Containment (Excluding the U.S. Gulf of Mexico)
We entered into an agreement with a third-party service provider for it to supply subsea capping and containment equipment on a global basis (excluding the U.S. Gulf of Mexico). The equipment includes capping stacks, debris removal, subsea dispersant and auxiliary equipment. The equipment meets industry accepted standards and can be deployed by air cargo and other conventional means to suit multiple application scenarios. We also developed an emergency response plan and response organization to prepare and demonstrate our readiness to respond to a subsea well control incident. Capping and containment for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is detailed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Operated and Non-operated) section below.
Oil Spill Response
To complement our agreement discussed above for subsea capping and containment equipment, we became a charter member of the Global Dispersant Stockpile (“GSD”). The dispersant stockpile, which is managed by Oil Spill Response Limited (“OSRL”) of Southampton, England, an oil spill response contractor, consists of 5,000 cubic meters of dispersant strategically located at OSRL bases around the world. The total volume of the stockpile located at the OSRL bases is calculated to provide members with the ability to respond to a major spill incident. Dispersant from the GSD can be used in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Mauritania and Senegal (Non-operated)
Kosmos transferred operatorship of Mauritania and Senegal operations to BP at the beginning of 2018 and was not the operator for any operations during 2021.
Ghana (Non-operated)
Tullow, our partner and the operator of the Jubilee Unit and the TEN fields, maintains Oil Spill Contingency Plans (“OSCP”) covering the Jubilee Field and Deepwater Tano Block. Under the OSCPs, emergency response teams may be activated to respond to oil spill incidents. Tullow has access to OSRL’s oil spill response services comprising technical expertise and assistance, including access to response equipment and dispersant spraying systems. Tullow maintains lease agreements with OSRL for Tier 1 and Tier 2 packages of oil spill response equipment. 
Equatorial Guinea (Operated and Non-operated)
Effective January 1, 2019, Trident became operator of the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. In addition, Kosmos has joined the Equatorial Guinea Oil and Gas Operators Emergency Resource Allocation Agreement to share equipment with other in country operators in case of emergency. Our membership in OSRL provides access to Tier II and III equipment located in Accra, Ghana and Southampton, England, UK. 
U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Operated and Non-operated)
After the major well control incident and oil release in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the U.S. Department of Interior updated regulations which govern the type, amount and capabilities of response equipment that needs to be available to operators to respond to similar incidents. These regulations also dictate the type and frequency of training that operating personnel need to receive and demonstrate proficiency in. Kosmos also has an Oil Spill Response Plan (“OSRP”) which is approved by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”). This OSRP would be activated if needed in the event of an oil spill or containment event in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Kosmos joined several cooperatives that were established to meet the requirements of the new regulations. For capping and containment, Kosmos joined the Helix Well Containment Group (“HWCG”) consortium whose capabilities include; (i) two dual ram capping stacks rated at 15,000 psi and 10,000 psi respectively, (ii) intervention equipment to cap and contain a well with the mechanical and structural integrity to be shut in at depths up to 10,000 feet, and (iii) the ability to capture and process 130,000 barrels of fluid per day and 220 Mcf of gas per day. Kosmos is also a member of the Clean Gulf Associate (“CGA”) Oil Spill Cooperative, which provides oil spill response capabilities to meet regulatory requirements. Equipment and services include a High Volume Open Sea Skimming System (“HOSS”), dedicated oil spill response vessels strategically positioned along the U.S. gulf coast, dispersant and dispersant delivery systems, various types of spill response booms and mobile wildlife rehabilitation equipment. Due to federal regulations, all of the HWCG and CGA equipment is dedicated to U.S. operations and cannot be utilized outside the country.
Human Capital Resources
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees and those that work with us is a priority for Kosmos. Employees and contractors are expected to take all necessary and reasonable actions to ensure safe operations by following safe work practices, complying with relevant policies and regulations, and completing all applicable training. To support our dedication to health, safety and the environment, we have a comprehensive Health, Safety, Environment and Security (“HSES”) management system that applies to all Kosmos employees and contractors known as “The Standard.” In addition to adoption of The Standard, Kosmos fosters a strong safety culture through online and in person training, regular emergency response drills, and impactful safety discussions.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the health of our employees and contractors continued to be a priority for 2021 including the establishment of a COVID-19 vaccination and testing policy, facilitating remote working flexibility for employees normally based in the office, and safeguarding operations offshore through a variety of enhanced operational safeguards and monitoring measures, including strict pre-embarkation quarantine procedures, wellness screenings, and COVID-19 testing.
Culture, Engagement and Development
Kosmos aims to be a world-class company known for delivering results and being a workplace of choice. We pride ourselves on our ability to provide employees with careers that are professionally challenging, personally rewarding, and focused on delivering value. We aim to provide a stimulating and rewarding work environment through an inclusive culture that promotes entrepreneurial thinking, facilitates teamwork, and embraces ethical behavior.
Kosmos is committed to investing in the development of our employees. We support development through a blend of learning approaches including in-person and virtual training opportunities, on-the-job training, conferences, cross team projects and experiences and our leadership development program. Each year, all employees also have an opportunity to provide feedback on the employee experience and Kosmos culture through our annual employee opinion survey. In 2021, Kosmos achieved top quartile performance relative to peer companies. The feedback received through this annual survey is used to support continuous improvement and enhance the overall employee experience. In 2021, Kosmos had a retention rate greater than 93%.
Diversity and Inclusion
Kosmos focuses on recruiting, retaining, and developing a diverse and inclusive workforce that embraces our values and culture. We seek to promote diversity in our workforce both because it is the right thing to do and because it gives us access to the widest range of talents. Through social and educational events that address the different backgrounds and identities of employees, Kosmos helps foster a spirit of inclusion across the company. We promote and celebrate the array of diverse perspectives and experiences of Kosmos employees and applicants, whether in terms of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, religion, national origin, disability, or experiences.
We seek to employ qualified individuals from the countries in which we operate and are proud of our record of recruitment and retention of local staff. This year we maintained 100% local employees across all our host country offices.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 229 employees with 199 being based in the United States and 30 residing in our local offices. Our workforce was approximately 38% gender diverse and approximately 33% minority. 
Employee Well-being 
Kosmos offers employees a robust range of benefits, including health plans, equity opportunities, savings plans, short- and long-term incentives. All domestic employees are awarded equity in the company as part of the total reward package, aligning employee reward with shareholder interest. Our benefits package prioritizes emotional, physical, and financial health and wellness. We also offer a strong Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which offers free and confidential assessments, counseling, and follow-up services to employees with personal and/or work-related mental health problems.
These benefits are intended to both promote the long-term health and well-being of our employees and increase employee engagement and retention. Additionally, we believe that these benefits help facilitate a strong work-life balance and a culture that prioritizes overall employee wellness.
