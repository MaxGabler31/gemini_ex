ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS
ONE Gas, Inc. is incorporated under the laws of the state of Oklahoma. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol “OGS,” and is included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. We are a 100-percent regulated natural gas distribution utility, headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and one of the largest publicly traded natural gas utilities in the United States. We are the successor to the company founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, which became ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) in 1980. On January 31, 2014, ONE Gas officially separated from ONEOK, Inc.
We provide natural gas distribution services to our approximately 2.2 million customers and are the largest natural gas distributor in Oklahoma and Kansas and the third largest in Texas, in terms of customers. We primarily serve residential, commercial and transportation customers in all three states. Our largest natural gas distribution markets in terms of customers are Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, Kansas; and Austin and El Paso, Texas. Our three divisions, Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, distribute natural gas to approximately 88 percent, 72 percent and 13 percent of the natural gas distribution customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, respectively.
OUR STRATEGY
Our vision is to be a premier natural gas distribution company, creating exceptional value for all stakeholders. Our mission is to deliver natural gas for a better tomorrow. Our business strategy is focused on:
•Safe and Reliable Energy - We are committed, first and foremost, to pursuing a zero-incident safety and 100-percent compliance culture through programs, procedures, policies, guidelines and internal controls designed to mitigate risk and incidents that may harm our employees, contractors, customers, the public or the environment. A significant portion of our capital spending is focused on the safety, integrity, reliability and efficiency of our natural gas distribution system, which also has the benefit of reducing methane emissions from our pipeline system. We also deploy a variety of operational and damage prevention procedures and technologies to monitor and maintain our natural gas distribution system and allow safe delivery of natural gas to our customers. Our Company’s focus on safety also extends to protecting our assets and information systems from physical damage and cyber intrusions through the utilization of robust security solutions, workforce training and crisis drills, among other initiatives.
•A High-performing Workforce - Our employees are the foundation of our Company. Our success begins with a values-driven culture and a commitment to developing an innovative, agile, diverse and engaged workforce where every employee understands that they can and do make a difference. 
•Capital Demand Growth - As a result of our commitment to enhance the integrity, reliability and safety of our existing infrastructure, we are making significant investments in our existing system. In addition, as some of our service territories continue to experience accelerating economic growth, our capital investments for main line extensions and service lines to serve new customers, will further contribute to our growth.
•Customer Affordability - We understand the importance of providing reliable, but also affordable, energy to our customers. We are focused on efficiently managing our resources and leveraging innovative technology solutions to enhance operational efficiency. We offer energy efficiency and education programs that help our customers invest in higher efficiency appliances and reduce energy usage. For customers needing assistance, we offer payment arrangement options and seek to connect customers to social service agencies that provide financial assistance.
•Energy Transition Solutions - We are committed to environmental stewardship, social responsibility and good corporate governance, all evaluated through the lens of our core values of safety, ethics, diversity and inclusion, service and value. We are focused on continually improving and expanding disclosures of our ESG-related plans, programs, goals and targets. We believe that natural gas assets will continue to play a pivotal role in a cleaner energy future and that we are uniquely positioned to deliver affordable, reliable and renewable energy to customers, now and into the future.
REGULATORY OVERVIEW
We are subject to the regulations and oversight of the state and local regulatory authorities of the territories in which we operate. Rates and charges for natural gas distribution services are established by the OCC for Oklahoma Natural Gas and by the KCC for Kansas Gas Service. Texas Gas Service is subject to regulatory oversight by the various incorporated cities that it serves, which have primary jurisdiction for their respective service areas. Rates in unincorporated areas of our service territory in Texas and all appellate matters are subject to regulatory oversight by the RRC. These regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that the utilities in their jurisdictions provide safe and reliable service at a reasonable cost, while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return on their investments.
Generally, our rates and charges are established in rate case proceedings. Regulatory authorities may also approve mechanisms that allow for adjustments for specific costs or investments made between rate cases. Due to the nature of the regulatory process, there is an inherent lag between the time that we make investments or incur additional costs and the setting of new rates and/or charges to recover those investments or costs. Additionally, we are not allowed recovery of certain costs we incur.
The following provides additional detail on the regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions we serve.
Oklahoma - Oklahoma Natural Gas currently operates under a PBRC mechanism, which provides for streamlined annual rate reviews between rate cases to adjust rates for incremental capital investment and changes in revenue and allowed expenses. Under this mechanism, we have an authorized ROE of 9.4 percent, with a 100 basis point dead-band of 8.9 to 9.9 percent. If our achieved ROE is below 8.9 percent, our base rates are increased upon OCC approval to an amount necessary to restore the ROE to 9.4 percent. If our achieved ROE exceeds 9.9 percent, the portion of the earnings that exceeds 9.9 percent is shared with our customers, who receive the benefit of 75 percent of those earnings. We receive the benefit of the remaining 25 percent. Oklahoma Natural Gas is required to make filings pursuant to the PBRC mechanism for the 12 months ended December 31 for each of the years 2022 through 2026. Oklahoma Natural Gas is also required to file a rate case on or before June 30, 2027, based on a test year consisting of the twelve months ended December 31, 2026.
Kansas - Kansas Gas Service files periodic rate cases with the KCC as needed. Between rate cases, Kansas Gas Service adjusts rates through provisions of the GSRS statute. The GSRS statute allows Kansas Gas Service to file for a rate adjustment providing a recovery of and return on qualifying infrastructure investments incurred between rate case filings, including safety-related investments to replace, upgrade or modernize obsolete facilities, as well as projects that enhance the integrity of pipeline system components or extend the useful life of such assets. Eligible investments also include expenditures for relocations and physical and cyber security. Filings cannot occur more often than once every 12 months and the rate adjustment cannot increase the monthly charge by more than $0.80 per residential customer per month compared with the most recent GSRS filing. Rate adjustments reflected in the GSRS surcharge may only be collected for 60 months before Kansas Gas Service is required to file a rate case or cease collection of this surcharge. Kansas Gas Service expects to file rate adjustments annually for this surcharge until it is required to file a rate case under the GSRS statute.
Texas - Texas Gas Service provides service to customers in five service areas. These service areas are further divided into the incorporated cities and the unincorporated areas. Periodic rate cases are filed with the cities or the RRC, as needed. Between rate cases, Texas Gas Service can adjust rates through annual filings pursuant to the GRIP statute or an annual COSA filing.
Annual filings under the GRIP statute allow Texas Gas Service to recover taxes and depreciation and to earn a return on the annual net increase in investment for a service area. After the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the rate schedules from the first GRIP filing for a service area, Texas Gas Service is required to file a full rate case. A full rate case may be filed at shorter intervals if desired by either Texas Gas Service or the regulator. Texas Gas Service makes annual GRIP filings for the incorporated cities in three of its service areas and for the unincorporated areas in all five service areas, which combined comprise 89 percent of Texas Gas Service’s customers.
COSA tariffs permit Texas Gas Service to recover return, taxes and depreciation on the annual increases in net investment, and adjust for annual increases or decreases in certain expenses and revenues. The various COSAs have a cap on the increase in expenses. A full rate case may be filed when desired by Texas Gas Service or the regulator but is not required. Texas Gas Service makes an annual COSA filing for the incorporated cities in two of its service areas, comprising 11 percent of its customers. 
Weather normalization - All of our service areas utilize weather normalization mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to reduce the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the additional volumes used when actual HDDs exceed normalized HDDs and to increase the delivery charge component of customers’ bills for the reduction in volumes used when actual HDDs are less than normal HDDs. Normal HDDs are established through rate proceedings in each of our jurisdictions.

(4) | Our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms allow recovery of expenses the Company incurs to purchase, transport, and store natural gas for our customers. These costs are passed on to customers without markup. 
(5) | We recover the gas cost portion of bad debts through our various purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. 
(6) | Expense trackers include pension and other postemployment benefits costs for Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, ad-valorem taxes in Kansas and pipeline integrity testing expenses in Texas. 

Our natural gas sales include fixed and variable charges related to the delivery of natural gas and gas costs that are passed through to our customers in accordance with our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms. Fixed charges reflect the portion of our natural gas sales attributable to the monthly fixed customer charge component of our rates, which does not fluctuate based on customer usage in each period. Variable charges reflect the portion of our natural gas sales that fluctuate with the volumes delivered and billed and the effects of weather normalization.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 88 percent, 55 percent, and 68 percent of our revenues from sales customers, excluding the cost of natural gas, were recovered from fixed charges for Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service, and Texas Gas Service, respectively.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND SEASONALITY
Supply - We purchased 164 Bcf and 153 Bcf of natural gas supply in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our natural gas supply portfolio consists of contracts with varying terms from a diverse group of suppliers. We award these contracts through competitive-bidding processes to ensure reliable and competitively priced natural gas supply. We acquire our natural gas supply from natural gas processors, marketers and producers.
An objective of our supply-sourcing strategy is to provide value to our customers through reliable, competitively priced and flexible natural gas supply and transportation from multiple production areas and suppliers. This strategy is designed to mitigate the impact on our supply from physical interruption, financial difficulties of a single supplier, natural disasters and other unforeseen force majeure events, as well as to ensure that adequate supply is available to meet the variations of customer demand.
We do not anticipate problems with securing natural gas supply to satisfy customer demand; however, if supply shortages were to occur, we have curtailment provisions in our tariffs that allow us to reduce or discontinue natural gas service to large industrial users and to request that residential and commercial customers reduce their natural gas requirements to an amount essential for public health and safety. In addition, during times of critical supply disruptions, curtailments of deliveries to customers with firm contracts may be made in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate federal, state and local regulatory agencies.
Natural gas supply requirements for our sales customers are impacted by weather and economic conditions. The consumption patterns for our customers may change from time-to-time in response to a variety of possible factors, including: 
•the occurrence of a significant disruption in natural gas supplies, either by itself, or accompanied by higher or lower natural gas prices;
•the availability of more energy-efficient construction methods or home improvements such as installation or replacement of insulated doors and windows, additional or energy efficient insulation and installation or replacement of existing appliances with more efficient appliances; and
•fuel switching from natural gas to electricity.
In each jurisdiction in which we operate, changes in customer-usage profiles are considered in the periodic redesign of our rates.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 51.4 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity under contract with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years and maximum allowable daily withdrawal capacity of approximately 1.4 Bcf. This storage capacity allows us to purchase natural gas during the off-peak season and store it for use in the winter periods. This storage is also needed to assure the reliability of gas deliveries during peak demands for natural gas. Approximately 26 percent of our winter natural gas supply needs for our sales customers is expected to be supplied from storage.
In managing our natural gas supply portfolios, we partially mitigate price volatility for our customers using a combination of financial derivatives and natural gas in storage. We have natural gas financial hedging programs that have been authorized by the OCC, KCC and certain jurisdictions in Texas. We do not utilize financial derivatives for speculative purposes, nor do we have trading operations associated with our business.
Demand - See discussion below under Seasonality, Competition and CNG for factors affecting demand for our services.
Seasonality - Natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial portion of their natural gas requirements are for heating. Accordingly, the volume of natural gas sales is normally higher during the months of November through March than in other months of the year. The impact on our natural gas sales resulting from weather temperatures that are above or below normal is offset partially through our WNA mechanisms. See the tables above under Regulatory Overview for additional information.
Competition - We encounter competition based on customers’ preference for natural gas, compared with other energy alternatives and their comparative prices. We compete primarily to supply energy for space and water heating, cooking and clothes drying. Significant energy usage competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential and small commercial markets. Customers and builders typically make the decision on the type of equipment, and therefore the energy source, at initial installation, generally locking in the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Changes in the competitive position of natural gas relative to electricity and other energy alternatives have the potential to cause a decline in consumption of natural gas or in the number of natural gas customers.
We are subject to competition from other pipelines for our large industrial and commercial customers, and this competition has and may continue to impact revenues. Under our transportation tariffs, qualifying industrial and commercial customers are able to purchase their natural gas supply from the provider of their choice and contract with us to transport it for a fee. A portion of the transportation services that we provide are at negotiated rates that are below the maximum approved transportation tariff rates. Reduced-rate transportation service may be negotiated when a competitive pipeline is in close proximity or another viable energy option is available to the customer.
CNG - In meeting demand for CNG for motor vehicle transportation, particularly from fleet operators who value its lower greenhouse gas emissions and operating fuel costs relative to gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles, we have continued to supply natural gas to CNG fueling stations. Our strategy is to support third-party investment in CNG fueling stations. We deploy capital to connect CNG stations built and operated by third parties to our system. As of December 31, 2021, we supply 145 fueling stations, 33 of which we operate in conjunction with our own fleets. Of the 112 remaining stations, 66 are retail and 46 are private stations. We transported 2.8 million Dth to CNG stations in 2021, which represents an increase of 6 percent compared with 2020.
RNG and Hydrogen – RNG and hydrogen technologies offer potential opportunities to secure new gas supply sources that could be transported on our pipelines. We are making investments in RNG and hydrogen technologies and innovation, including: (1) establishing interconnection guidelines for delivery of RNG to our system, (2) working directly with developers and end-use customers to identify potential RNG projects, (3) analyzing pipeline system integrity and gas supply implications, including sourcing opportunities, related to hydrogen use in our system, (4) partnering with industry groups to develop methodologies regarding hydrogen blending and utilization, and (5) evaluating the opportunity to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS
See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report for information regarding environmental and safety matters.
HUMAN CAPITAL
The foundation of our Company is our employees and our success begins with a culture driven by our core values and a commitment to developing an innovative, agile, diverse and engaged workforce where every employee understands that they can and do make a difference. We believe that advancing a safe, ethical, inclusive and diverse culture creates an environment that attracts and retains the high-performing workforce needed to successfully execute our strategy.
Employees and Employee Engagement - We employed approximately 3,600 people at February 1, 2022, including approximately 700 people at Kansas Gas Service who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The following table sets forth our contracts with collective bargaining units at February 1, 2022:
Union | Approximate Employees | Contract Expires
The United Steelworkers | 400 | May 31, 2022 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers | 300 | June 30, 2024 

We recognize that employees are a key stakeholder group for the success of our business. Therefore, we perform an annual survey to monitor and assess employee engagement.
Workplace Health and Safety - Safety is our number one core value and the foundation of everything we do. A strong safety culture can reduce risk, enhance productivity and build a strong reputation in the communities in which we operate. Our success is reliant on training and development, performance management and shared responsibility that focuses on engagement and ensures our employees know what is expected to keep themselves, their teammates, our customers and communities safe. To reinforce our commitment to the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities we include four operational measures, TRIR, DART, PVIR and ERT, in our short-term incentive compensation. By including four operational measures in our short-term incentive compensation, we focus on the importance of personal injury prevention, reducing the severity of injuries, safe driving, and public safety. The following table sets forth our performance in these operational measures for the periods indicated:

 | Years Ended December 31,
Operational measure | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 
TRIR | 0.96 | 1.02 | 1.04 
DART | 0.22 | 0.28 | 0.25 
PVIR | 2.10 | 1.76 | 1.75 
ERT | 62.7% | 64.5% | 62.8%

TRIR, DART and PVIR are personal safety metrics tracked by the American Gas Association. We regularly rank in the top quartile for similar-sized LDCs for these metrics.
As part of our culture of safety, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and have maintained many of the precautions put in place in 2020 to allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable service while protecting our employees, customers, and communities.
We also are committed to a supportive culture of physical, financial, emotional and social wellness for employees. We provide health and wellness programs to support and inspire our employees to make healthy personal and professional lifestyle choices. 
Inclusion and Diversity - Our core values include inclusion and diversity, and we believe in equity and the value and voice of every employee. As part of our commitment, we have and continue to consider inclusion and diversity implications in our recruiting process, Company training, and Company performance monitoring. For example, we monitor the performance of our diversity statistics about our workforce across roles and seniority levels. Additionally, we make available conscious inclusion training to all employees. We also have an Inclusion and Diversity Council, which is chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, and includes five employees serving as permanent members, with 14 employees serving as rotating members with two-year terms. The Inclusion and Diversity Council provides governance and guidance for implementing our strategy and sharing our vision of an inclusive and diverse workforce. We also have employee-led resource groups to provide community and support to our employees based on shared characteristics, interests or experiences. We continue to examine how we can promote inclusion and diversity in our human capital management and may implement additional practices in the future.
