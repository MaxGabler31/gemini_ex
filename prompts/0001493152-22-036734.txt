Complementary and Alternative Medicine Manufacturing Industry
 
Maintaining health and well-being has moved to the forefront of Australian’s minds as the COVID-19 epidemic has swept across the globe. This has led to a surge in consumer demand for health and wellbeing products in tandem with an increased awareness of naturopath remedies.
 
Technological advancement has lagged the industry average in the supplements sector, though projected growth and increased demand will force the industry to adapt and invest into technological and productive innovation.
 
Overall, success in the vitamin and supplement industry is characterized by three attributes: low revenue concentration, high Asian demand and economies of scale.
 
A well-positioned firm would optimally take advantage of these factors by expanding internationally and producing high volumes to minimize marginal costs and maximise profits before established players can collect a market share too large to appropriate.
