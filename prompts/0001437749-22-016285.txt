Overview
 
GB Sciences, Inc. (“the Company”, “GB Sciences”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a plant-inspired, biopharmaceutical research and development company creating patented, disease-targeted formulations of cannabis- and other plant-inspired therapeutic mixtures for the prescription drug market through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, GbS Global Biopharma, Inc. (“GBSGB”).
 
Through GBSGB, the Company is engaged in the research and development of plant-inspired medicines, with virtual operations in North America and Europe. GBSGB’s assets include a portfolio of intellectual property containing both proprietary plant-inspired formulations and our AI-enabled drug discovery platform, as well as critical research contracts and key supplier arrangements. The Company’s intellectual property portfolio, which is held by GBSGB, contains six issued U.S. and three issued foreign patents, as well as 18 U.S. and 49 foreign patent-pending applications. On October 14th, 2021, we filed the nonprovisional USPTO patent application entitled “METHOD AND SYSTEMS FOR PHYTOMEDICINE ANALYTICS FOR RESEARCH OPTIMIZATION AT SCALE" to further protect aspects of our proprietary drug discovery engine, PhAROS™, which stands for Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale. On March 1st, 2022, the Company’s newest patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The Company’s newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis.
 
GBSGB’s intellectual property covers a range of over 65 medical conditions, from which five drug development programs are in the preclinical stage of drug development including our formulations for Parkinson’s disease ("PD"), chronic pain, COVID-related cytokine release syndrome, depression/anxiety, and cardiovascular therapeutic programs. The Company’s primary focus is on preparing its lead program for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease for a first-in-human clinical trial. Depending on the results of ongoing preclinical studies, the Company intends to move forward with clinical trials for its chronic pain and COVID-related cytokine release syndrome therapies after PD. The Company’s formulations for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression are currently in preclinical animal studies with researchers at the National Research Council Canada. The Company also recently received positive preclinical proof-of-concept data supporting its complex mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome related to COVID-19, and its lead candidates will be optimized based on late-stage preclinical studies at Michigan State University. Proof-of-concept studies in animals that support our heart disease formulations have been successfully completed at the University of Hawaii. The Company runs a lean drug development program through GBSGB and takes effort to minimize expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Our productive research and development network includes distinguished universities, hospitals, and Contract Research Organizations. 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 4, 2001, under the name “Flagstick Venture, Inc.” On March 28, 2008, stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common stock approved changing our then name “Signature Exploration and Production Corp.” as our business model had changed.

Business Strategy
 
Drug Discovery and Development of Novel Cannabis- and Other Plant-Inspired Therapies

Through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. ("GBSGB"), the Company has conducted ground-breaking research embracing the rational design of plant-inspired medicines led by Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, the Company’s President, Chief Science Officer, and Director. In the early days, Small-Howard and Dr. Helen Turner, Vice President of Innovation and Dean of the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Department at Chaminade University, posited that minimum essential mixtures of plant-based ingredients would provide more targeted and effective treatments for specific disease conditions than either single ingredient or whole plant formulations. They started with cannabis-based drug discovery and developed a rapid screening and assaying system that tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes in vitro against cell-based models of disease. This process identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and chronic neuropathic pain. More recently, a similar approach has been applied to the discovery and validation of therapies informed by plants described in a variety of Traditional Medical Systems. These rich discovery efforts have yielded new preclinical programs; for example, our anxiety and depression formulations that contain minimum essential mixtures of compounds derived from plants in the Piper plant family, such as kava.  
 
Currently, the Company’s drug discovery engine involves both a data analytics/machine learning tool to expedite drug discovery and high throughput screening of cell and animal models of disease. As previously mentioned, the Company initially explored the potential medical uses of specific mixtures derived from cannabis-based raw materials, but our early in silico tools have now been improved, and they are becoming increasingly effective for investigating the medical applications of potential therapeutic mixtures from any plant-derived starting material. In 2014, the Company developed its first rapid screening and assaying system which tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes against cell-based models of diseases. This process has been refined over the years and now has identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic and neuropathic pain. Through GBSGB, the Company has filed for patent protection on these plant-inspired, minimum essential mixtures, and they are validating them in disease-specific animal models in preparation for human trials.
 
The Company’s drug discovery process combines: 1) PhAROS™: Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale for the prediction of minimum essential mixtures from plant-based materials, and 2) HTS: high throughput screening to refine and validate plant-inspired, minimum essential mixtures in well-established cell and animal models of diseases. This combined approach to drug discovery increases research efficiency and accuracy reducing the time from ideation to patenting from 7 years to 1.5 years. The Company now uses its PhAROS™ Drug Discovery Platform to ‘pre-validate’ therapeutic mixtures. PhAROS can both prioritize and eliminate some potential combinations, which reduces time and resources used in the discovery period. PhAROS™ can also be used to identify and predict the efficacy of plant-inspired, minimum essential mixtures for specific diseases in silico, which are then tested by screening in cell and animal models. Screening of plant-inspired mixtures for drug discovery involves the testing of specific combinations of plant chemicals from many naturally occurring plants and the use of live models for these diseases that have been well established by other researchers. The Company refines the potential therapeutic mixtures pre-validated by PhAROS™ to optimize their effectiveness using cell and animal models. Based on data from disease-specific assays, therapeutic formulations are refined during the HTS screening process by removing compounds that do not act synergistically with the others in the mixtures. The goal is to identify minimum essential mixtures (MEM) that retain the efficacy of the whole plant extracts, but with the manufacturing and quality control advantages of single ingredient pharmaceutical products.
 
In October of 2021, GBSGB began its first preclinical animal trial of non-cannabis-based formulations that were discovered and pre-validated using our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform. The National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”) are testing the Company’s proprietary, psychotropic plant-based formulas for the treatment of depression and anxiety. For these novel psychotropic drug candidates, the Company used the PhAROS™ platform to identify new ingredients to improve upon an initial formulation for anxiety based on traditional medicine. The original plant mixture was derived from the kava plant, but some elements of kava are thought to cause liver toxicity. PhAROS™ identified ingredients from the Piper plant family as a substitute for the functionality of the ingredients in question without the potentially adverse safety profiles of those original ingredients. The Piper plant family includes pepper plants that are used worldwide in traditional medicines. The Company’s new psychotropic formulations are currently in preclinical trials at the Zebrafish Toxicology, Genomics and Neurobiology Lab at the NRC, led by Dr. Lee Ellis, Research Officer and Team Lead. The ongoing work between the NRC and the Company has produced strong and applicable data for the evaluation of its therapies, and this trial could provide novel treatment options for patients with depression and anxiety.
 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allows complex mixtures to be claimed as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("APIs"). Through GBSGB, the Company has six issued patents, plus a series of pending patents containing plant-derived complex mixtures and minimum essential mixtures that act as therapeutic agents for specific disease categories, as described below. The Company’s pending patents are protected whether the individual compounds are derived from the cannabis plant, another plant, synthetically produced, or derived from a combination of sources for the individual chemical compounds in these mixtures. On March 1st, 2022, the Company’s newest patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The Company’s newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis. This year, our growing intellectual property portfolio was augmented with additional patent-protections for our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform, new PhAROS™ discovered, non-cannabis formulations, and improved formulations for our PD therapeutics.

Drug Development Progress
 
The Company has made significant strides in the past year with respect to both its drug discovery research and product development programs. The Company, through GBSGB, now has five preclinical phase product development programs and is aggressively preparing its lead formulations for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease for a first-in-human clinical trial. Our lead program in Parkinson’s disease is being prepared for a first-in-human trial through the following essential steps: a) creating clinical prototypes by combining our proprietary Parkinson’s formulas with a convenient oral delivery system; b) performing a dose response study in rodents to establish the correct range of active ingredients for our first-in-human trial; c) performing necessary ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicology) tests on the clinical prototypes; and d) selecting a Contract Research Organization (CRO) to prepare an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US FDA to begin our first-in-human trial. In addition to our work in preparing the Parkinson’s formulation for a First-in-Human trial, the Company’s chronic pain, anxiety, and depression formulations are currently in preclinical animal studies with Dr. Lee Ellis of the National Research Council ("NRC") Canada in Halifax, Nova Scotia. We received positive preclinical, proof-of-concept data supporting our minimum essential mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome in COVID-19 (COVID-CRS) and other severe hyperinflammatory conditions. GBSGB’s lead COVID-CRS candidates will be optimized based on late-stage preclinical studies with Dr. Norbert Kaminski at Michigan State University.
 
For the Company’s lead program in PD therapeutics, the efficacy of our original formulations has been improved and the Company has filed a new patent application family to protect our defined cannabinoid ratio-minimum essential mixtures (DCR-MEMs) for the treatment of Parkinsonian motor symptoms. The Company had announced previously that it has obtained the statistically significant reduction of Parkinson’s-disease like symptoms using proprietary cannabinoid-containing MEMs in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease ("PD"). Three of the Company’s PD formulations significantly reduced the PD-like motor symptoms. In addition, the toxicity studies for these original PD formulas came back without any significant negative findings. These initial efficacious PD formulations were equimolar minimum essential mixtures (E-MEMs), wherein, each contained three cannabinoids combined at an equimolar ratio (1:1:1). In the past year 2020-2021, the Company has screened an additional sixty-three variations of the original three equimolar MEMs and identified a total of twenty-two DCR-MEMs with optimized ratios of cannabinoids that produced a statistically significant reduction in OHDA induced motor symptoms. Five of these twenty-two efficacious MEMs outperformed the original equimolar cannabinoid MEMs. A new patent application has been filed to protect these DCR-MEMs. These important preclinical results will be included in GBS’ Investigational New Drug ("IND") application with the US FDA to enter human clinical trials as soon as possible. New therapies to address Parkinson’s disease symptoms are needed to help those afflicted with this debilitating disease. The combined direct and indirect costs associated with Parkinson’s disease are estimated at $52 billion in the U.S. alone.
 
This year, we are working with Catalent Pharma on the preparation of clinical prototypes of our proprietary cannabinoid-based formulations for Parkinson’s disease in Catalent Pharma’s proprietary Zydis® delivery system. Catalent Pharma’s Zydis® delivery system is an Orally Disintegrating Tablet format (“ODT”) that should be ideal for delivering our cannabinoid-ratio controlled formulations to Parkinson’s patients. More than 50% of Parkinson’s patients have trouble swallowing, but the Zydis® format delivers the active ingredients into the mouth by dispersion without needing water or the ability to swallow. To ready the Company’s Parkinson’s disease therapies for a First-in-Human trial, the initial clinical prototypes of our Defined Cannabinoid Ratio (DCR)-MEM have been formulated by Catalent Pharma using Catalent’s Zydis® Orally Disintegrating Tablet technology and they are being evaluated in stability and functional testing. As mentioned above, the ODT format was selected for the PD formulas because it dissolves on the tongues of patients without the need to swallow for ease of use in patients with PD, who often have difficulties with swallowing. Previously, the Company has completed two proof-of-concept studies for its MEM. Now, the Company is performing a Feasibility Study that will produce and validate the clinical prototypes for its DCR-MEM. The Company selected Catalent for the delivery of their PD therapies due to Catalent’s prior experience in working on US FDA-approved, cannabinoid-containing drugs, their Schedule I drug manufacturing facilities, their familiarity with US FDA and international regulatory and manufacturing requirements, their expertise in tackling formulation challenges, and their ability to achieve the stability and dosing necessary for these novel therapeutic mixtures. In addition to its Zydis® technology, Catalent has early drug development services and additional oral drug delivery solutions available for the efficient delivery of the Company's proprietary APIs.

Additionally, the Company has selected the University of Lethbridge to start our required dose response study in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease, which will help us to establish the correct dosing for our first-in-human trial. Prior to filing our IND application, we must conduct ADMET testing on the clinical prototypes of our Parkinson’s medication being formulated for us by Catalent Pharma. The Company has identified a Contract Research Organization that will perform the ADMET testing. In the IND application for our novel Parkinson’s disease therapy, the ADMET testing data will be combined with the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) data prepared by Catalent Pharma and our proof-of-concept data (National Research Council Canada). In the near future, we expect to announce the selection of the Contract Research Organization that will write the IND-application and run the first-in-human trials for our novel treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
 
For its lead chronic pain program, the Company is testing its MEM for chronic pain both as encapsulated, time-released nanoparticles, as well as in non-encapsulated forms of these therapeutic mixtures in an animal model at the NRC in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In preparation for human clinical trials, our standard MEM and the time-released MEM are currently being compared in an animal model that demonstrates their potential effectiveness at treating chronic pain. The early results from this preclinical research project look very promising. However, the COVID pandemic adversely affected the progress on this study, but we are happy to report that we are back on track to continue with the testing of these promising chronic pain formulations.
 
In late summer of 2021, the Company received positive proof-of-concept data from a human immune cell model supporting the efficacy of their proprietary MEM designed for the suppression of COVID-related, cytokine release syndromes (CRS) while preserving key anti-viral immune responses. Based on this new positive proof-of-concept data, GBSGB converted their provisional patent application entitled, “CANNABINOID-CONTAINING COMPLEX MIXTURES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME WHILE PRESERVING KEY ANTI-VIRAL IMMUNE REACTIONS” to a nonprovisional patent application on August 18, 2021. The best performing MEM will be further developed in preparation for clinical studies to evaluate their anti-inflammatory potential in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients contending with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and associated hyperinflammatory conditions, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CRS, MAS, and ARDS are the leading causes of deaths in COVID-19 patients. The Company’s proof-of-concept study was performed at Michigan State University using a state-of-the-science human immune model. In the Company’s proof-of-concept study, immune cells from human donors were co-cultured together in one of four treatment groups: untreated (no inflammatory stimulus), inflammatory stimulus, control (inflammatory stimulus + vehicle from cannabinoid mixtures), or pre-treatment with the cannabinoid mixture + inflammatory stimulus. Then a panel of cytokines and inflammatory markers was measured from each of these treatment groups from different immune cell types within the co-cultured cells at four time points to determine whether the Company’s MEMs were able to alter the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or other inflammatory agents. The Company’s COVID-CRS formulations showed potential for the selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory processes in response to viral- and bacterial-triggered hyperinflammation in a human immune cell model. These positive proof-of-concept results support the potential for some of these mixtures to accomplish our therapeutic goals, but, ultimately, clinical trial results will determine whether they are efficacious. The Company’s plant-based drug discovery platform is advancing biopharmaceutical research at a time when thousands are dying from COVID-19. The next step is to further develop our plant-inspired drugs and eventually bring them to human trials so that the use of well-defined cannabinoid mixtures in clinical practice can become a reality.

As mentioned above, the Company announced that the NRC Canada is testing our proprietary, psychotropic plant-based formulas for the treatment of depression and anxiety in preclinical animal studies. The Company has leveraged its patent-pending PhAROS™ (Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale) platform to identify these combinations of plant compounds for novel drug candidates to treat depression and anxiety. These are the company’s first non-cannabis formulations to enter preclinical studies. For these novel psychotropic drug candidates, the Company used the PhAROS™ platform to identify new ingredients to improve upon an initial formulation for anxiety based on traditional medicine. The original plant mixture was derived from the kava plant, but some elements of kava are thought to cause liver toxicity. PhAROS™ identified ingredients from the Piper plant family as a substitute for the functionality of the ingredients in question without the potentially adverse safety profiles of those original ingredients. The Piper plant family includes pepper plants that are used worldwide in traditional medicines. The Global Anxiety Disorder and Depression Treatment Market size is forecast to reach USD 19.81 Billion by 2028 according to Reports & Data.
 
Favorable Research Updates from our university collaborators reveal the promise in our discovery programs including: 1) Multiple MEM discovery projects using and advancing our proprietary PhAROS™ drug discovery platform in conjunction with Chaminade University, 2) the Company’s Cannabis Metabolomics Project with both Chaminade University of Honolulu, Hawai’i and the University of Athens, Greece, and 3) the Company’s Time-Released Nanoparticles for Delivery of Cannabis-based Ingredients with the University of Seville, Spain and the University of Cadiz, Spain.
 
This year, our growing intellectual property portfolio was augmented with additional patent-protections for our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform that were filed in July of 2021 and in October of 2021. The Company, through GBSGB, also filed for protection of new PhAROS™ discovered, non-cannabis formulations in July of 2021. In September of 2021, the Company filed a patent application for the Company’s improved DCR-MEM formulations for our PD therapeutic program. These new patent applications expanded upon the solid foundation of intellectual property developed over the past six years. In 2020, the three patents which protect formulations for the Company’s lead therapeutic programs were issued by the USPTO. The issuance of U.S. Patent No. 10,653,640 entitled "Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases" on May 19, 2020 protects methods of using GBSGB’s proprietary cannabinoid-containing complex mixtures (CCCM™) for treating Parkinson’s Disease. This was an important milestone in the development of these vitally important therapies and validates GBSGB’s drug discovery platform. In the US alone, the combined direct and indirect costs associated with Parkinson’s disease are estimated at $52 billion, and new therapies to address Parkinson’s disease symptoms are greatly needed. This was also the first time that a US patent has been awarded for a cannabis-based complex mixture defined using this type of drug discovery method. The first US patent for PD therapies validated our drug discovery platform and strengthened our intellectual property portfolio of unique CCCM’s™, each targeting one of up to 60 specific clinical applications.
 
The issuance of the Company’s second and third US patents for active pharmaceutical ingredients that are complex mixtures identified by our biotech platform further confirmed that the Company’s pharmaceutical compositions can be patent protected for use as biopharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. The US Patent entitled “Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures Targeting TRPV1” protects methods of using our proprietary MEMs for the treatment of pain disorders related to arthritis, shingles, irritable bowel syndrome, sickle cell disease, and endometriosis. In the US alone, chronic pain represents an estimated health burden of between $560 and $650 billion dollars, and an estimated 20.4% of U.S. adults suffer from chronic pain that significantly decreases their quality of life. Despite the widespread rates of addiction and death, opioids remain the standard of care treatment for most people with chronic pain. The Company believes that it is important to create safer, less addictive alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain disorders, like GBSGB’s myrcene-containing MEMs.
 
The Company's third issued US Patent entitled "Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Mast-Cell-Associated or Basophil-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders" protects methods of using the Company’s proprietary MEMs for treating Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). MCAS is a severe immunological condition in which mast cells inappropriately and excessively release inflammatory mediators, resulting in a range of severe chronic hyperinflammatory symptoms and life-threatening anaphylaxis attacks. Receiving this patent for the treatment of MCAS using our MEMs is an important milestone in the development of this urgently needed medicine. There is no single recommended treatment for MCAS patients. Instead, they attempt to manage MCAS symptoms primarily by avoiding ‘triggers’ and using rescue medicines for their severe hyperinflammatory attacks. Therefore, MCAS patients need new therapeutic options to control their mast cell related symptoms, and our MEMs were designed to simultaneously control multiple inflammatory pathways within mast cells as a comprehensive treatment option. The Company is strategically targeting MCAS for two additional reasons. By focusing on a rare disease with no known cure, our company can apply for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s expedited approval process, which allows clinically successful treatments to get to market both quicker and more cost effectively. Gaining approval from the US FDA for the entire anti-inflammatory market would be extremely time consuming and cost prohibitive. Demonstrating that our MEMs are safe for the treatment of MCAS would favorably position our Company for clinical testing of these MEMs as potential treatments for other related inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, thereby widening the target market and drastically shortening the development cycle and costs.
 
The Company’s fourth US Patent was issued on March 1, 2022 for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. Gb Sciences’ newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis. Despite multiple categories of prescription heart medications on the market, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States for people of most racial and ethnic groups. Alternative therapeutic approaches are still needed, especially for the treatment of advanced heart disease. The market for prescription heart disease medications is predicted to rise to $64 billion dollars in the US by 2026, with future market growth fueled by innovative new therapeutic approaches.

Partnering Strategy 
 
The Company runs a lean drug development program and minimizes expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses (such as lab and diagnostic equipment), through strategic partnerships with universities, hospitals, suppliers, Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”), and Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”). Through these research and development agreements, the Company has created a virtual pipeline for the further development of novel medicines based on ingredients originally derived from the cannabis plant and other plant-based traditional medicines. The partners bring both expertise and infrastructure at a reasonable cost to the life sciences program. In most instances, the Company has also negotiated with these partners to keep 100% of the ownership of the IP within GBSGB for original patent filings.
 
The Company currently has on-going research agreements with the following institutions covering the indicated areas of research:
 
Chaminade University: Broad-based research program to support the drug discovery platform that has yielded many of the Company’s original patents to date in the areas of neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, inflammatory diseases, neuropathic and chronic pain. They have also performed the bioassay portion of the Cannabis Metabolomics study performed with the University of Athens, Greece and the Company. Our collaborations with Chaminade also led to the development of our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform.
 
University of Athens: Broad-based metabolomics analysis of over 100 cannabis genotypes including both hemp and THC-producing cannabis varieties, in combination with the Company’s bioassay data linking genotypes and potential disease-remediations. This project has the potential to define active ingredients from plant-derived mixtures beyond the standard cannabinoids and terpenoids. The discovery potential is huge, and novel agents have recently been discovered. Novel ligands have been identified and are being validated. This project will ultimately yield novel patent-protected therapies.
 
Michigan State University: Preclinical work using a cutting-edge, multi-cellular model of the human immune system and a multi-cell model of the brain to validate our MEMs for use in the treatment of COVID-19-related cytokine release syndromes (COVID-CRS). MSU has performed experiments using their novel model of the human-immune system that have allowed GBSGB to prepare cannabis-based formulas for the potential treatment of virally-induced hyperinflammation/cytokine storm syndrome that has led to the majority of COVID-19 deaths. Positive proof-of-concept results have guided the development of these selectively anti-inflammatory MEM.
 
The University of Seville: Bringing their novel expertise to the development and functional testing of time-released and disease-targeted nanoparticles of cannabis-based minimum essential mixtures for oral administration. These specialized nanoparticles are being used for the precise and time-released delivery of several of our therapies, including the Company’s chronic pain MEMs used in the preclinical animal testing performed at the NRC Canada. The University of Seville has completed functional testing on nanoparticles containing myrcene, nerolidol, and beta-caryophyllene for our chronic pain MEMs. In cell-based assays, the effectiveness and kinetics of the nanoparticle-forms of these terpenes were compared with the “naked” terpenes both individually and in mixtures. In all cases, the effectiveness of the nanoparticles was superior to the naked terpenes, however, the mixtures were dramatically more effective than the individuals. Recently, our partners at the University of Seville have completed the formulation of new cannabis-based ingredients for inclusion into the oral, time-released nanoparticle format for the completion of our maximally effective MEMs for chronic pain. The results from Seville are very promising, and these nanoparticles have entered the animal testing phase at the NRC in Halifax.
 
The National Research Center (NRC) of Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia: Four animal-phase studies are being performed by Dr. Lee Ellis’ group at the NRC. 1) Parkinson’s Disease: In Q1 of 2020, an animal safety and efficacy study was completed for the Company’s equimolar MEMs for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and the NRC has demonstrated that the company’s PD formulations were able to reduce behavioral changes associated with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, which underlies the pathology of Parkinson’s disease in the animal model. Based on achieving the statistically significant reduction in Parkinson’s disease symptomology in these equimolar MEMs, the Company completed a final phase of testing in August of 2021, which identified five defined cannabinoid ratio (DCR)-MEMs that were more effective than the root equimolar MEM. 2) Chronic Pain: In Q1 of 2019, the Company started a safety and efficacy study in animals for our Chronic Pain (CP) formulas. The midterm results for these preclinical pain studies were promising, but the study was significantly delayed by the COVID pandemic. These preclinical studies have resumed and are progressing well. 3 & 4) Depression and Anxiety: Minimum essential mixtures of plant-based ingredients from kava and the related Piper plant family are being evaluated now.
 
The University of Cadiz: Testing the safety and efficacy of the above-mentioned time-released nanoparticles in rodent models of chronic pain. Proof of concept complete for one formulation.
 
University of Hawaii: Validating the efficacy of a complex cannabis-based mixture for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac disease in a rodent model. Proof of concept work is complete in rodents, and we are seeking commercialization partners.

Path to Market: Drug Development Stages and Proposed Clinical Trials
 
The Company has plant-based therapeutic products in the following stages of drug development: Discovery, Pre-Clinical, and entering the Clinical Phase. It has also licensed therapeutic products that the Company intends to develop through partners, labeled Partner Programs.
 
The completion of discovery, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the required regulatory submissions required for obtaining US FDA pre-market approvals for pharmaceutical products (and equivalent approvals from other corresponding agencies worldwide) is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, the Company asserts that its proprietary, PhAROS™, AI-enabled, drug discovery engine; plant-inspired formulations; lean development program; novel regulatory strategy; experienced development partners; and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. The Company uses a combination of in silico discovery methods and automated screening of cellular and animal models of disease to decrease the time in Discovery prior to filing novel patent applications for disease-specific therapeutics. Through GBSGB, the Company’s original patent applications cover new chemical entities (“NCE”) based on discovery and validation of minimum essential mixtures derived from complex, plant-based therapeutics. The Company plans to use an Exploratory IND/Phase 0 Program that gets the Company to First-in-Human sooner than traditional programs, which reduces translational risks, and includes preliminary efficacy measures for responsible development decisions. In contrast, a traditional phased-development path would not provide any efficacy measures until Phase II. After the completion of our Phase 0 study for PD, which compares the efficacies of multiple related cannabinoid-based formulations, the Company plans to advance the lead PD drug candidate using an adaptive trial design that is more efficient than the traditional phased-development pathway. Through GBSGB, the Company has entered into research contracts, partnerships, and/or joint ventures with several respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools, universities, and with other scientific consultants to increase developmental efficiencies. If and when one or more of the Company’s drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the US FDA, the Company will seek to market them under licensing arrangements with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
 
There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the US FDA. Even if we obtain US FDA approval to market one of our therapies, there can be no assurance that it could be successfully marketed or would not be superseded by another plant-based therapy produced by one or more of our competitors. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If the Company fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more plant-inspired pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.
 
Other Operations
 
On March 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") with AJE Management, LLC. Pursuant to the Teco MIPA, the Company agreed to sell 100% of its membership interests in GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, and GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC (the "Teco Subsidiaries") for approximately $8 million, which amount includes a cash payment at closing, the extinguishment of certain liabilities owed to the purchaser and affiliates of the purchaser, and an 8% promissory note.
 
On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") and Promissory Note Modification Agreement with 483 Management, LLC. Pursuant to the Nopah MIPA, the Company agreed to sell its 100% membership interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC ("Nopah"), which holds a Nevada medical marijuana cultivation certificate. As consideration, the Company would receive $300,000 as a reduction to the balance of the 0% Note payable dated October 23, 2017 (Note 4) and accounts payable of $74,647, which were owed to an affiliate of the purchaser.
 
The closing of the Teco and Nopah sales was contingent upon the successful transfer of the Nevada cultivation and production licenses. On December 14, 2021, the Company received approval from the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board for the transfer of cannabis cultivation and extraction licenses held by its subsidiaries GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, and GB Sciences Nopah, LLC (the "Nevada Subsidiaries"). Consequently, all conditions to closing the sales of the 100% membership interests in the Nevada Subsidiaries were satisfied, and the transactions formally closed on December 31, 2021. After the closing date, the Company retains no ownership interest in the Nevada Subsidiaries.

Competition
 
The biotech industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. We face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include Cara Therapeutics Inc., Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tetra Bio-Pharma, Inc., Revive Therapeutics, Inc., Axim Biotechnologies, Inc., and Emerald BioScience, Inc., among others.
 
There are several organizations that may be developing or marketing therapies for the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our competitors, including many of the organizations named above, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. 
 
We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement from government and third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 
Government Regulation and Federal Policy
 
Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
FDA Regulation
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 
●completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy; 
 ●submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
 ●performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
 ●submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA") after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 ●a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
 ●satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; 
 ●satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more of the clinical sites at which the clinical trials were conducted; 
 ●at the discretion of the FDA, a public Advisory Committee Meeting where the data is reviewed by experts who discuss the data and give their opinion (which the FDA is not obliged to follow) of the adequacy of the data to support an approval; and 
 ●FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S. 
 
    15 

  

We rely, and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production, distribution, shipping and storage of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Cannabis Regulation
 
Although the Company has completely divested of its cannabis cultivation and production facilities effective December 31, 2021, the Company has owned and operated subsidiaries that were involved in the manufacturing and distribution of cannabis products under State law. These operations were subject to prohibition under United States federal law.
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis (marijuana) is a Schedule 1 narcotic that is addictive and has no medical benefit. Accordingly, and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited and subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical cannabis, there is a risk that the federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to have engaged in producing, cultivating, or dispensing cannabis in violation of federal law, or we may be deemed to have facilitated the sale or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law with respect to our Company’s divested business operations. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our strategic goals, revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. See “Risk Factors” below. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by San Diego County, California that sought to establish federal preemption over state medical cannabis laws. The preemption claim was rejected by every court that reviewed the case. The California 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in its unanimous ruling, “Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws.” However, in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, as long as the CSA contains prohibitions against cannabis, under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the United States may criminalize the production and use of cannabis even where states approve its use for medical purposes.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued Guidance Regarding Cannabis Enforcement to all United States attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.
 
    16 

  

The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational cannabis possession in small amounts.
 
The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 

• | Distribution of cannabis to children;
--+--------------------------------------


• | Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminals;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversion of medical cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Using state authorized cannabis activity as a pretext of another illegal drug activity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing drugged driving;
--+----------------------------


• | Growing cannabis on federal property; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | Preventing possession or use of cannabis on federal property.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Ogden Memo and the Cole Memos.
 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of cannabis for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address cannabis activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical cannabis and recreational cannabis in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis.
 
In contrast to federal policy, the majority of U.S. states, four U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and adult recreational use of cannabis. Many other states are considering similar legislation.
