ITEM 1.       BUSINESS.
Background
 
Empire Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Empire"), was incorporated in the State of Utah in August 1983 under the name Chambers Energy Corporation and domesticated in Delaware in March 1985 under the name Americomm Corporation.  The Company's name was changed to Americomm Resources Corporation in July 1995.  On May 29, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation acquired Empire Petroleum Corporation, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Americomm Resources Corporation.  On August 15, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation and Empire Petroleum Corporation merged and the Company's name was changed to Empire Petroleum Corporation.
Lease Option Agreements
 
During 2015, the Company entered into two Lease Option Agreements primarily in South Dakota.
 
In the first, with BHPP Group, the Company had an exclusive option for a period of two years ended April 8, 2017 to enter into oil and gas leases with respect to mineral interests owned by BHPP in Haakon, Meade, and Pennington Counties in South Dakota.  The Lease Option Agreement covered approximately 150,000 gross leasable acres.  The Company granted BHPP the option to acquire 1,000,000 shares of the Company's stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share.
 
Under Lease Option Agreement II, with Anderson Brothers, the Company had an exclusive option for a period of two years ended April 30, 2017 to enter into oil and lease leases with respect to mineral interests owned by the Anderson Brothers in Perkins and Harding Counties in South Dakota and Adams County in North Dakota.  The Lease Option Agreement covered approximate 10,000 gross leasable acres.  The Company granted Anderson Brothers the option to acquire 250,000 shares of the Company's stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share.
 
Both lease options were determined to be impaired at the end of 2016 due to management's expectation that the lease options would not be exercised prior to expiring in April 2017.  The result of the impairment was the write off of the carrying value of the lease options as of December 31, 2016.
 
Investment in Masterson West II
 
On December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a subscription and contribution agreement with Masterson West, LLC ("Masterson West") (the "Contribution Agreement") relating to the newly formed Masterson West II, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("Masterson West II").   Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, among other things, (a) at the initial closing, the Company agreed to contribute 2,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), to Masterson West II, along with an additional 38,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (b) at the final closing, Masterson West has an obligation to contribute certain oil and gas properties (the "Contributed Properties") to Masterson West II in exchange for the Company contributing cash of not less than $9,000,000 and up to $18,000,000 to Masterson West II.  There is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure the funds necessary for the final closing.  The final closing was scheduled to occur no later than April 1, 2017.  If the final closing occurs, the Company will own 50% of Masterson West II if it delivers $18,000,000 of cash at the final closing and 25% of Masterson West II if it delivers $9,000,000 of cash at the final closing.
 
Also on December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a limited liability agreement of Masterson West II with Masterson West (the "LLC Agreement").  Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and the LLC Agreement, Masterson West is immediately entitled to a distribution of the 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, but is only entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of the 38,000,000 shares of Common Stock if and when the final closing occurs.
 
In connection with the contribution of the Contributed Properties by Masterson West, at the final closing, Masterson West II will assume a credit facility affiliated with the Contributed Properties that has approximately $20,000,000 outstanding as of the date hereof.  Masterson West and the Company intends to use the cash consideration paid by the Company at the final closing to pay down such credit facility and/or as working capital to continue to develop the Contributed Properties.  If the proceeds are used to pay down part or all of such credit facility, the credit facility will be used to continue to develop the Contributed Properties.
 
All of Contributed Properties are located in Moore and Potter Counties in Texas and the wells to be included in such Contributed Properties primarily target the red cave formation at a depth of 2,100 to 2,300 feet.  Masterson West and affiliate of Masterson West, Adams Affiliates Inc., have owned and operated the Contributed Properties for over 20 years.  The Company has targeted this transaction for a number of reasons.  First, the Contributed Properties are currently producing approximately 1,000 barrels of oil per day equivalent and include approximately 8,000 net acres of leasehold that are held by such production.  Second, the Company believes this transaction is a lower risk oil-weighted infill drilling opportunity as Masterson West has identified approximately 380 locations to develop on five to ten acre spacing units, with approximately 200 proved undeveloped drilling locations.  The Company estimates the total cost to complete each well will be approximately $250,000.

On February 18, 2017, Gary C. Adams, the majority owner of Masterson West unexpectedly passed away. As a result of this development, the final closing did not occur on April 1, 2017, the final close date per the Contribution Agreement. Though the transaction did not close before the stated final closing date, the Agreement remains in effect until one or both parties serve a notice of termination. As of the date of this filing, neither party has elected to terminate the Contribution Agreement. The Company is continuing its discussions with representatives of Masterson West regarding a potential transaction with Masterson West.
 
Changes in Directors and Executive Officers
 
On December 22, 2016, J. C. Whorton, Jr. resigned as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  On December 23, 2016, the sole remaining member of the Board of Directors, Michael R. Morrisett, appointed Anthony N. Kamin to fill the vacancy on the Board of Directors created by Mr. Whorton's resignation.
On November 28, 2017, Thomas Pritchard was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
 
Competition
 
The oil and gas business is extremely competitive.  The Company must compete with many long-established companies with greater financial resources and technical capabilities.  The Company is not a significant participant in the oil and gas industry.
Markets; Price Volatility
 
The market price of oil and gas is volatile, subject to speculative movement and depends upon numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including expectations regarding inflation, global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs. Future profitability, if any, will depend substantially upon the prevailing prices for oil and gas.  If the market price for oil and gas remains depressed in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to raise additional capital necessary to finance operations. Lower oil and gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas, if any, that can be produced economically from the Company's properties.  The Company anticipates that the prices of oil and gas will fluctuate somewhat in the near future.
Regulation
 
The oil and gas industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the production, transportation and sale of hydrocarbons as well as the taxation of income resulting therefrom.
 
Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is constantly changing.  Numerous federal and state departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry.  In general, these rules and regulations regulate, among other things, the extent to which acreage may be acquired or relinquished; spacing of wells; measures required for preventing waste of oil and gas resources; and, in some cases, rates of production.  The heavy and increasing regulatory burdens on the oil and gas industry increase the Company's cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability.
 
Many times leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the BLM and the Minerals Management Service ("MMS") of the U.S. Department of the Interior, both of which are federal agencies.  Such leases are issued through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BLM and MMS regulations and orders (which are subject to change by the BLM and the MMS).  Leases are also accompanied by stipulations imposing restrictions on surface use and operations.  Operations to be conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes.  Federal leases also generally require a complete archaeology and environmental impact assessment prior to the authorization of an exploration or development plan.
 
The oil and gas operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites.  These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities if the Company fails to comply or if any contamination results from the Company's operations.
 
Employees
 
The Company has no employees.   Until December 22, 2016, J.C. Whorton served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Michael R. Morrisett was appointed as the Company's President. On December 22, 2016, Mr. Whorton resigned his position as Chief Executive Officer at which time Mr. Morrisett appointed Anthony Kamin to fill the vacancy on the Board of Directors created by Mr. Whorton's resignation. On November 28, 2017, Thomas Pritchard was appointed as the Company's Chief Executive Officer.
 
 No board members received cash compensation from the Company in 2016.  
On November 29, 2017, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.15 per share, and 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.25 per share, to Anthony Kamin as consideration for his service on the Board of Directors.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company paid Mr. Morrisett $54,700 for services rendered.  In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2017 but before his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pritchard's firm was paid $56,764 for professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company paid Mr. Pritchard $10,000 for services rendered as Chief Executive Officer. On November 29, 2017, the Company issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of  Common Stock at $0.25 per share to each of Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Morrisett for services rendered to the Company.
