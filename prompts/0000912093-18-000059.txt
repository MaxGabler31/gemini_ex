ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
Overview
Viavi Solutions Inc. (“VIAVI,” also referred to as “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”), is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises, network equipment manufacturers, civil government, military and avionics customers, supported by a worldwide channel community including VIAVI Velocity Partners. Our Velocity program (“Velocity”) allows us to optimize the use of direct or partner sales depending on application and sales volume. Velocity expands our reach into new market segments as well as expands our capability to sell and deliver solutions. We deliver end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. VIAVI is also a leader in high performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, 3D sensing, electronics, automotive, defense and instrumentation markets. On August 1, 2015, we completed the separation (“Separation”) of our optical components and lasers business and created two publicly-traded companies: 

• | an optical components and commercial lasers company, Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“Lumentum”), consisting of our former Communications and Commercial Optical Products (“CCOP”) segment and the WaveReady product line within our Network Enablement (“NE”) segment; and


• | a network and service enablement and optical coatings company, renamed VIAVI, consisting of our NE, Service Enablement (“SE”), collectively (“NSE”) and Optical Security and Performance Products (“OSP”) segments.

In connection with the Separation, the Company, JDS Uniphase Corporation, was renamed “Viavi Solutions Inc.” Activities related to the Lumentum business have been presented as discontinued operations in all periods of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying disclosures, discussion and analysis herein pertains to the Company’s continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.
To serve our markets, during fiscal 2018, we operated the following business segments:

• | Network Enablement


• | Service Enablement


• | Optical Security and Performance Products

Industry Trends
NE and SE
The telecommunication (“Telecom”) and cable industries are facing substantial business and technology disruptions that are transforming the users’ experience in accessing voice, data, social media and video content. Multiple network technologies are being deployed to meet the needs of increased network capacity and faster transmission speeds across both the physical and the virtual networks and across the airwaves. All forms of the network are being upgraded to faster speeds to achieve multi-gigabit per second (“Gbps”) broadband speeds and faster response time. 100G optical fiber is being deployed in the Metro networks. Optical is being delivered to fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) and permeating to everywhere. 400G optical fiber technology is being evaluated by network equipment manufacturers (“NEMs”). Cable service providers are investing in high speed connections and increased bandwidth availability with the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1. Telecom operators are upgrading legacy copper digital subscriber line (“DSL”) networks to Gfast technology. Over the airwaves, 4G/Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) wireless technology is expected to expand coverage with advanced LTE and 5G in the next couple years and provide 100x faster speeds than current LTE networks. 
With the growing number of connected smart mobile devices, the exponential growth in Internet of Things (“IOT”) devices, and demand for high-speed broadband access to support video and other high-bandwidth applications, capacity and intelligence are increasing at the edge of the network pushing the expansion of the overall network and larger links along with new networks requiring re-architecture for scalability and flexibility. This increased demand for capacity will require networks to be more agile, flexible, programmable and cost effective. It also will drive the network transition from a hardware-centric approach to a hybrid of physical and virtualized software-centric approach through software defined networking (“SDN”) and network function virtualization (“NFV”). Long term, network providers are pursuing automation to provide enhanced offerings including machine-to-machine communications, connected cars, mobile payment and security.

The convergence of network technologies requires sizable investments from communication service providers (“CSPs”), which consist of telecommunications, cable and cloud service providers. To achieve scale and a profitable return on investment, the telecom and cable industries in recent years are experiencing increased consolidation. New entrants have emerged with the rise of cloud service providers, who are increasing their capital expenditures and investing in advanced networks as enterprises are off-loading private corporate networks to the cloud. Traditional service provider capital spending in physical networks has been declining, which impacts the served available market opportunity for our NSE segment. However, the emergence of cloud service providers and virtualized networks create new opportunities for NSE. VIAVI’s NE and SE products and solutions are well positioned to meet these rapidly changing industry trends, given our technology, installed base and product offerings.
OSP
Counterfeiting of banknotes and other goods is on the rise because counterfeiters now have access to a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools giving them the ability to create convincing simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes. At the same time, the penalties for counterfeiting can often be relatively modest when compared to the penalties for other crimes. VIAVI has decades of anti-counterfeiting expertise leveraging our Optically Variable Pigment (“OVP®”), and our Optically Variable Magnetic Pigment (“OVMP®”) technologies to protect the integrity of banknotes and other high-value documents by delivering optical effects that are very easy for consumers to recognize but also very difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce. We also provide optical technologies for government, healthcare, consumer electronics and industrial markets.
In addition to Anti-Counterfeiting solutions, we extend our technology expertise to solve complex problems and deliver unique solutions in other industries. For example, we manufacture and sell optical filters for 3D sensing products that separate out ambient light from incoming data to allow devices to be controlled by a person’s movements or gestures. Our proprietary low angle shift technology enables our customers to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of their systems and deliver truly compelling system performance. Through multiple generations of increasing performance and decreasing cost, we believe we remain the industry’s leading supplier of high performance filters for depth-sensing systems in consumer electronics.
Sales and Marketing
CSPs make up the majority of NE and SE revenues. VIAVI also markets and sells products to network equipment manufacturers (“NEMs”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), enterprises, governmental organizations, distributors and strategic partners worldwide. VIAVI has a dedicated sales force organized around the markets its segments serve that works directly with customers’ executive, technical, manufacturing and purchasing personnel to determine design, performance, and cost requirements. VIAVI is also supported by a worldwide channel community, including VIAVI’s Velocity Solution Partners who support our NE and SE segments.
A high level of support is a critical part of VIAVI’s strategy to develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with our customers. VIAVI develops innovative products by engaging our customers at the initial design phase and continues to build that relationship as our customers’ needs change and develop. Service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners worldwide.
Corporate Information
The Company was incorporated in California in 1979 as Uniphase Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1993. We are the product of several significant mergers and acquisitions including, among others, the combination of Uniphase Corporation and JDS FITEL in 1999. In 2000 we acquired Optical Coatings Lab, Inc., which is currently part of our OSP business, and in 2005 we acquired Acterna, Inc. which is currently part of our NSE business. Following these acquisitions, we operated as a company comprised of a portfolio of businesses with a focus on optical innovation, communications network and service enablement, commercial lasers and anti-counterfeiting solutions. In August 2015, JDSU separated the portfolio of businesses into two separate publicly-traded companies to gain greater strategic flexibility to address rapidly changing market dynamics.

Research and Development
During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred R&D expenses of $133.3 million, $136.3 million, and $166.4 million, respectively. The number of employees engaged in R&D was approximately 900 as of June 30, 2018.
We devote substantial resources to R&D to develop new and enhanced products to serve our markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both product performance and our ability to manufacture it in greater volume and at lower cost.
In our NE and SE segments, we develop portable test instruments for field service technicians, systems and software used in Network Operations Centers, and instruments used in the development, testing and production of communications network components, modules and equipment. We are increasing our focus on IP-based service assurance and customer experience management, and test instruments for wireless networks and services, while continuing to develop tools for fiber optic, optical transport, Ethernet, broadband access, video test and storage network testing. We have centers of excellence for product marketing and development in Asia, Europe and North America.
In our OSP segment, our R&D efforts concentrate on developing more innovative technologies and products for customers in the anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, government, healthcare and automotive markets. Our strength in the banknote anti-counterfeiting market is complemented by our advances in developing novel pigments and foils for a variety of applications. Other areas of R&D focus for OSP include our efforts to leverage our optical coating technology expertise to develop applications for the government and defense markets as well as efforts related to new products for 3D sensing and smart phone sensors. OSP has also introduced an innovative handheld spectrometer solution with applications in the agriculture, healthcare and defense markets.

Manufacturing
As of June 30, 2018, significant manufacturing facilities for our NE, SE and OSP segments were located in China, France, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States and our significant contract manufacturing partners were located in China and Mexico.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
VIAVI uses various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of June 30, 2018, we owned approximately 762 U.S. patents and 1,197 foreign patents and have 624 patent applications pending throughout the world.
Backlog
We consider our backlog balance to be an estimate of future revenue to be earned from contractually committed product and service arrangements. As of June 30, 2018, and July 1, 2017, our backlog was approximately $221.9 million and $177 million, respectively. The increase in backlog is driven by the AW acquisition.
Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period.
Employees
We employed approximately 3,500 employees as of June 30, 2018, which included approximately 1200 employees in manufacturing, 900 employees in research and development, 850 employees in sales and marketing, and 550 employees in general and administration. This compared to a workforce of approximately 2,700 as of July 1, 2017, and 3,000 as of July 2, 2016.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. We recognize stock-based compensation cost over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis. No compensation cost is recognized for awards forfeited by employees that do not render requisite service and we estimate forfeiture based on historical experience. 
Similar to other technology companies, we rely upon our ability to use “Full Value Awards” (as defined below) and other forms of stock-based compensation as key components of our executive and employee compensation structure. Full Value Awards refer to restricted stock units (“RSUs”), market-based RSUs (“MSUs”) and performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) that are granted without an exercise or purchase price and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting. The MSUs have vesting requirements tied to the performance of the Company’s stock as compared to the NASDAQ telecommunications index, and could vest at a higher or lower rate or not at all, based on this relative performance. The PSUs have vesting requirements tied to the performance of the Company and may not vest at all. Historically, these components have been critical to our ability to retain important personnel and offer competitive compensation packages. Without these components, we would be required to significantly increase cash compensation levels or develop alternative compensation structures to retain our key employees.
Outside of the United States, our businesses are subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. The Company follows statutory requirements, and in certain European countries it is common for a works council, consisting of elected employees, to represent the sites when discussing matters such as compensation, benefits or terminations of employment. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Seasonality
As is typical for many large companies and our competitors, our business is seasonal. Orders are generally higher in our first and second fiscal quarters and lower in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed, and other revenue recognition criteria are met, and because a significant portion of our in-period revenue comes from our deferred revenue balance.
