ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Company Description and Development of the Business
The discussion below describes the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, an Ohio corporation (“Scotts Miracle-Gro” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “us”), including general developments in the Company’s business during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”). For additional information on recent business developments, see “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products in North America. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. Our key consumer lawn and garden brands include Scotts® and Turf Builder® lawn and grass seed products; Miracle-Gro®, Nature’s Care®, Scotts®, LiquaFeed® and Osmocote®1 gardening and landscape products; and Ortho®, Roundup®2, Home Defense® and Tomcat® branded insect control, weed control and rodent control products. We are the exclusive agent of the Monsanto Company, a subsidiary of Bayer AG since June 2018 (“Monsanto”), for the marketing and distribution of Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® non-selective weedkiller products within the United States and certain other specified countries. We have a presence in similar branded consumer products in China and Latin America. 
Through our Hawthorne segment, we are a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor garden, lighting and ventilation systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. Our key hydroponic gardening brands include General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Vermicrop®, Agrolux®, Can-Filters® and AeroGarden®. On June 4, 2018, our Hawthorne segment acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Sunlight Supply, Inc., Sunlight Garden Supply, Inc., Sunlight Garden Supply, ULC, and IP Holdings, LLC, and all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Columbia River Industrial Holdings, LLC (collectively “Sunlight Supply”). Sunlight Supply is the largest distributor of hydroponic products in the United States, and is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing horticultural, organics, lighting and hydroponics products, including lighting fixtures, nutrients, seeds and growing media, systems, trays, fans, filters, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, timers, instruments, water pumps, irrigation supplies and hand tools. Prior to the transaction, Sunlight Supply served as a non-exclusive distributor of the Company. Sunlight Supply manufactures and markets branded hydroponic gardening products under key brands including Sun System®, Gro Pro®, Mother Earth®, Hurricane® and Grower's Edge®. See “Acquisitions” for further discussion.
Prior to August 31, 2017, we operated consumer lawn and garden businesses located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom (the “International Business”). On April 29, 2017, we received a binding and irrevocable conditional offer (the “Offer”) from Exponent Private Equity LLP (“Exponent”) to purchase the International Business. On July 5, 2017, we accepted the Offer and entered into the Share and Business Sale Agreement (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) contemplated by the Offer. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Scotts-Sierra Investments LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into separate stock or asset sale transactions with respect to the International Business. The sale of the International Business to Exponent closed on August 31, 2017.
Prior to April 13, 2016, we operated the Scotts LawnService® business (the “SLS Business”), which provided residential and commercial lawn care, tree and shrub care and pest control services in the United States. On April 13, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) between the Company and TruGreen Holding Corporation (“TruGreen Holdings”), we completed the contribution of the SLS Business to a newly formed subsidiary of TruGreen Holdings (the “TruGreen Joint Venture”) in exchange for a minority equity interest of approximately 30% in the TruGreen Joint Venture. We now participate in the residential and commercial lawn care, tree and shrub care and pest control services segments in the United States and Canada through our interest in the TruGreen Joint Venture.
Scotts Miracle-Gro traces its heritage to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry-consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three powerful leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. In fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern’s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro® brand, the industry leader in

water-soluble garden plant foods. In 1998, we acquired the Ortho® brand in the United States and obtained exclusive rights to market Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® brand within the United States and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, we believe that Scotts®, Turf Builder®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho® and Roundup® are among the most widely recognized brands in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the United States.
Business Segments
We divide our business into the following reportable segments:

• | U.S. Consumer


• | Hawthorne


• | Other

U.S. Consumer consists of our consumer lawn and garden business located in the geographic United States. Hawthorne consists of our indoor, urban and hydroponic gardening business. Other consists of our consumer lawn and garden business in geographies other than the U.S. and our product sales to commercial nurseries, greenhouses and other professional customers. Corporate consists of general and administrative expenses and certain other income/expense items not allocated to the business segments. This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker of the Company). Financial information about these segments for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is presented in “NOTE 22.

Products within this category include horticultural, organic, lighting and hydroponics products, including lighting fixtures, nutrients, seeds and growing media, systems, trays, fans, filters, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, timers, instruments, water pumps, irrigation supplies and hand tools, and are marketed under the General Hydroponics®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Vermicrop®, Agrolux®, Can-Filters®, Sun System®, Gro Pro®, Mother Earth®, Hurricane®, Grower's Edge® and AeroGarden® brand names.

Marketing Agreement: We are Monsanto’s exclusive marketing agent for Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® non-selective weedkiller products in the United States and certain other specified countries. On May 15, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the “Marketing Agreement Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (as amended, the “Original Marketing Agreement”) with Monsanto and also entered into a lawn and garden brand extension agreement (the “Brand Extension Agreement”) and a commercialization and technology agreement (the “Commercialization and Technology Agreement”) with Monsanto. On August 31, 2017, in connection with the sale of the International Business, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Restated Marketing Agreement”) and the Amended and Restated Lawn and Garden Brand Extension Agreement - Americas (the “Restated Brand Extension Agreement”) to reflect the Company’s transfer and assignment to Exponent of the Company’s rights and responsibilities under the Original Marketing Agreement, as amended, and the Brand Extension Agreement relating to those countries and territories subject to the sale.
Under the terms of the Restated Marketing Agreement, we are jointly responsible with Monsanto for developing consumer and trade marketing programs for Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® non-selective weedkiller products in the countries where we serve as agent. We also provide sales, merchandising, warehousing and other selling and marketing support for these products. The Company performs other services, including manufacturing conversion services, pursuant to ancillary agreements. The Restated Brand Extension Agreement provides the Company an exclusive license in each country throughout the North American continent, South American continent, Israel and China to use the Roundup® brand on additional products offered by the Company outside of the non-selective weedkiller category within the residential lawn and garden market. The application of the Roundup® brand to these additional products is subject to a product review and approval process developed between the Company and Monsanto. For additional details regarding the Restated Marketing Agreement, the Restated Brand Extension Agreement and the Commercialization and Technology Agreement, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — In the event the Restated Marketing Agreement for Monsanto’s consumer Roundup® products terminates, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 6. MARKETING AGREEMENT” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Divestitures
On April 29, 2017, we received the Offer from Exponent to purchase the International Business for approximately $250.0 million (subject to potential adjustment following closing in respect of the actual financial position at closing) and a deferred payment amount of up to $23.8 million.

On August 31, 2017, in connection with, and as a condition to, the consummation of the sale of the International Business, we entered into the Restated Marketing Agreement and Restated Brand Extension Agreement with Monsanto reflecting our transfer and assignment, to the purchaser of the International Business, of the rights and responsibilities under the Original Marketing Agreement, as amended, and the Brand Extension Agreement relating to those countries and territories subject to the sale.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of our wild bird food business in the United States and Canada for $4.1 million in cash and $1.0 million in earn-out payments. 
We have classified our results of operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations during the applicable periods. See “NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution
We sell our products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, e-commerce platforms, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors and retailers through both a direct sales force and our network of brokers and distributors. In addition, during fiscal 2018, we employed approximately 2,500 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers of our products.
The majority of our shipments to customers are made via common carriers or through distributors in the United States. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer business in North America, which are strategically located across the United States and Canada. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials such as urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the lawn and garden season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel, resin and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2018.
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We consider our trademarks, patents and licenses to be key competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho®, Tomcat®, Hyponex®, Earthgro®, General Hydroponics®, Vermicrop®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux®, Sun System®, Mother Earth® and Can-Filters® brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder®, EZ Seed®, Organic Choice®, Nature’s Care®, Home Defense Max®, Nature Scapes®, Weed B Gon® and Roundup® for Lawns are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 
6

In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering subject matters such as fertilizer, weed killer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; and mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and many of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements, permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single patent or group of related patents is considered significant to any of our business segments or the business as a whole.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our business is highly seasonal, with more than 75% of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual sales are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products, thereby reducing retailers’ pre-season inventories.
We anticipate significant orders for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year.
Significant Customers
We sell our products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, e-commerce platforms, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors and retailers through both a direct sales force and our network of brokers and distributors. 
Our three largest customers are Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart, which are reported within the U.S. Consumer segment and are the only customers that, during any of the periods in question, individually represent more than 10% of reported consolidated net sales. For additional details regarding significant customers, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers could adversely affect our financial results” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 20. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competitive Marketplace
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major retailers, distributors and advertising. 
In the lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Central Garden & Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, FoxFarm Soil & Fertilizer Company, Nanolux Technology, Inc., Sun Gro Horticulture, Inc., Advanced Nutrients, Ltd. and Hydrofarm, LLC. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors who operate in many of the areas where we compete.
In Canada, we face competition in the lawn and garden market from Premier Tech Ltd. and a variety of local companies including private label brands.
Research and Development
We continually invest in research and development, both in the laboratory and at the consumer level, to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. Spending on research and development was $42.5 million, $39.9 million and $36.0 million in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, including product registration costs of $11.4 million, $10.6 million and $10.6 million, respectively. In addition to the benefits of our own research and development, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners.

Regulatory Considerations
Local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affect the manufacture, sale, distribution and application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all products containing pesticides must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947, as amended (“FIFRA”), and most require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. Fertilizer and growing media products are subject to state and foreign labeling regulations. In addition to the regulations already described, federal, state and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. Our grass seed products are regulated by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. 
In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients.
State, federal and foreign authorities generally require growing media facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water.
For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various environmental proceedings, the majority of which are for site remediation. At September 30, 2018, $4.4 million was accrued for such environmental matters. During fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we expensed $1.6 million, $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for such environmental matters. We had no material capital expenditures during the last three fiscal years related to environmental or regulatory matters.
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, we employed approximately 5,150 employees. During peak sales and production periods, we employed approximately 5,750 employees, including seasonal and temporary labor.
