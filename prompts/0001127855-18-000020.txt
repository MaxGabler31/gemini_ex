ITEM 1.       BUSINESS.
Overview
 
NuZee-CA was established in 2011 as an importer and distributor of natural spring water and skincare products as well as energy drinks.
 
Up until September 30, 2013, our primary business was the distribution of natural and organic products produced by 3rd parties. These legacy product lines which included New Zealand bottled spring water, natural and organic skincare from New Zealand as well as the Torque TM energy drinks were phased out and/or discontinued in 2014 as the Company believed its best near and long term success was to focus resources on our own product line of functional beverages which will enable the Company to control, develop, manufacture and promote its brands from the United States.
 
During the 2013 fiscal year we began researching and investigating the viability of a new product platform for functional beverages and started producing our first family of functional beverages in early 2014.  These products are considered healthy alternatives, with all-natural ingredients and provide an added wellness benefit when compared to the traditional non-fortified version of the same beverage. 
 
As a result, NuZee's mission is to be a good-for-you company focused on building beverage brands that offer functional and nutritional benefits.
 
As of September, 2017, we have opened over 2,000 retail accounts with large chains including; Safeway, Whole Foods, HEB, Rouses, Jewel Osco, Lunardi's, Akin's, Buy For Less, Tony's Finer Foods, Lowe's, Albertsons, Kings, Meijers, Longs Drugs and many other smaller independent stores.  We have obtained these customers by working with brokers, distributors and attending multiple trade show events where there are endless networking and business opportunities.  In addition to the wholesale grocery chains we are working with Amazon exclusives and other online retailers, as well as contract co-packing and private labeling with an increased number of coffee roasters nationwide.

Our operational approach has and will remain to develop and manufacture our products under strict guidelines for good manufacturing and food safety practices before releasing our products to the market.  We own our formulas and work with experts in beverage, nutrition and flavoring sciences to ensure our products not only taste delicious but are also good-for-you products using quality and natural ingredients with proven clinical research to support the functional efficacy.  We are using multiple manufacturing partners, known in the industry as co-packers, to scale our manufacturing capabilities.
 
We sell our products directly to consumers through our www.coffeeblenders.com and www.twinpeaksroasters.com websites as well as through affiliate online stores and retailers.
 
Market Opportunity
 
As an emerging company in the functional beverage sector we are participating in a large growing market with historically growing sales. The functional beverage category is expected to reach $105 Billion Dollars by 2021.  NuZee's products fall within the nutraceutical drink portion of the functional beverage market which accounts for approximately 6% or $1 billion in the United States annually.
Principal Products
 
After careful study and research conducted in 2014 the Company determined its first functional beverage will be a line of single-serve gourmet coffees.  Our decision was based on numerous factors including the market for coffee and its continued growth, the ability to serve a cup of coffee quickly and conveniently as well as the ability for precise dosage of our active ingredients in pre-portioned packs.  Our knowhow is tied to our formula, process and use of natural flavoring to mask the undesired off-notes produced by the added functional ingredients such that the original beverage is preserved and there are no deficiencies in the taste and aroma profile.  Our family of products all utilize GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) ingredients that are also supported by clinical studies using the exact strength and dosage recommended by our ingredient partner's claims and research.
 
The Company made Coffee Blenders(®) available in the first quarter of 2014.  We believe Coffee Blenders to be the first line of gourmet specialty grade coffee offered in convenient single serve cups using only natural ingredients with clinically supported branded nutraceuticals.  We initially launched three functional varieties of Coffee Blenders called Lean Cup(®) (for weight loss), Think Cup(®) (for cognitive performance) and Relax Cup(®) (for stress reduction), and recently launched one more functional variety called Active Cup(®)  (for a pre-workout boost of energy).
 
Coffee Blenders are sold as single serve cup that are compatible with popular Keurig K-Cup1 brewers and systems.  Until late 2012, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. enjoyed patent protection of the K-Cup.  Expiration of the patent in September 2012 enabled 3rd party companies such as ours to produce K-Cup compatible packs for an existing installed base of brewers totaling more than 16 million units.2   Each Coffee Blenders K-cup compatible pod includes a total of 11 grams of coffee plus natural ingredients and comes in retail packaging of 10 K-Cup compatible pods per box.

Since 2014 we have grown our line tremendously.  In 2015, we started our Lotus Cup line, which is a gourmet pour-over coffee.  The product name changed from Lotus Cup to Drip Cup in 2015, with our first cup being the Nude Cup(®) Gourmet Pour-Over.  The Drip Cup quickly gained popularity within the coffee industry throughout 2015 and 2016.  We have now extended the Drip Cup line to also include the functional varietals: Lean Cup, Think Cup and Relax Cup.  Each Drip Cup includes a total of 11 grams of coffee plus natural ingredients and comes in retail packaging of 10 Drip Cup pouches per box.
 
While our brand Coffee Blenders has gained name recognition in the coffee beverages market, we also wanted to expand into tea.  Our only tea product, which was launched in July of 2016 is our Matcha Cup, which is available in single serve K-Cup compatible cups.
 
In October of 2016 we launched our Whole Bean coffee line and extended the line in early 2017 to include our Lean, Think, Relax functional SKU's using 100% arabica coffee.
 
In August of 2017 we launched our Twin Peaks™ line of pour over drip coffee and our 12 oz bagged whole bean in 4 different SKU's.  Colombian, Colombian Decaf, Honduran, & Costa Rican.  The Twin Peaks fine line of coffees is marketed towards an outdoor active lifestyle consumer.
 
With all our products being the "hot coffee" category we also discussed breaking into the cold brew market which appears to be showing substantial growth in the beverage industry, and in November of 2017 we launched our line of ready-to-drink functional cold brew coffee's in 10oz glass bottles.  With the success of our functional line of single serve cups and drip cups this was a natural line extension for Coffee Blenders.
 
Altogether, we currently have a total of 25 SKU's.
 
In 2018, we intend to focus our efforts on building our co-packing business for single serve pour over drip cup manufacturing and expanding our current operation further.

Customers
 
Our customers range from B2B (Business-to-business means one business makes a commercial transaction with another) multi-store retail chains to wholesale distributors that deliver to both chain and independent stores regionally.  We also sell to office and home delivery services that deliver coffee and water to homes and businesses locally.  Another portion of our business is online sales through our own B2C (Business-to-consumer is an Internet and electronic commerce (e-commerce) model that denotes a financial transaction or online sale between a business and consumer.  It involves a service or product exchange from a business to a consumer) site through organic as well as paid marketing campaigns through our affiliate network along with sales stemming from online retail accounts like Amazon.com.
Sales
 
In 2017 Coffee Blenders maintained a healthy relationship with our top retailers, distributors, & partners and added on over a dozen new retail chains.  In addition to expanding our shelf space in Safeway Eastern, our product is now in Albertsons, Meijer's, Spartan Nash, HEB, Lowes, Rouses, Jewel-Osco, Whole Foods, Piggly Wiggly's, King's, Tony's Finer Foods and other smaller independent grocery chains.  Many of these accounts were gained through KeHE & UNFI, our main distributors as of 2017.
 
While Coffee Blenders has been on the market for over three years, we still believe that a significant amount of capital will be required to generate additional sales and help support the current accounts that we currently have.  Our sales approach will be maintained by following the 4 stages below:
 
1.       Expand our co-packing operations to accommodate national roasters
 2.       Generate consumer trial
 3.       Drive repeat sales through heavy in-store promotions
 4.       Increase our velocity with our current customers
 
We have learned that by working with the retailers on providing proper employee training on the product, using heavy couponing and doing in store demo's the sales are driven higher and there are more repeat customers.  Our main focus for 2018 will be to continue our effective approach of attending trade shows to acquire new B2B commercial business.  We have added on to our inside sales force to incubate and curate new accounts.  We plan to expand our affiliate network and online advertising as well as cross promoting via social media to drive our B2C sales through our www.coffeeblenders.com & www.twinpeaksroasters.com domains.
 
At this time, most of the products sold will be under the "Coffee Blenders," "Twin Peaks" and "NuZee" trademarks.  We have expanded our production capabilities at our headquarters facility in Vista, CA to attract other companies that are interested in producing single serve pour over coffee to produce them at our facility, as well as meet consumer demands.  Our co-packing service is intended to increase market awareness and to help position our company as the leader in the U.S. for the pour over drip pouch coffee market.

Manufacturing
 
We have a primary manufacturing facility in Vista, California located at 2865 Scott St Suite 107 which is used for the production of our Single Serve Pour-Over Drip Cup line.  We also partner with three third-party manufacturers to manufacture finished products.  We have agreements in place with suppliers and partners for all components required to deliver a finished Coffee Blenders product.  Currently, the Company has not made any long-term commitments to any suppliers or production partners that will burden or impair the Company's ability to operate.
 
We purchase Green Whole Bean Coffee from Serengeti Trading Company located in Dripping Springs, TX on a contractual basis.  The green whole bean is then sent to our roaster at San Diego Coffee, Tea, & Spice, located in Oceanside, CA.
 
All the raw products (roasted ground coffee and nutraceuticals) are sent to Global Health Trax ("GHT") for mixing into our proprietary blends.   We do not have a written agreement with GHT.   Rather, all services performed by GHT are on a purchase order basis.  After GHT mixes our coffees, the final product is shipped to our co-packer Intelligent Blends, or our other co-packer Cafejo, for packaging into single-serving containers commonly known as "K cups" as well as our coffee blenders single serve drip cups and Twin Peaks pour-over and boxed for retail sales.
 
We also work with Pod Pack, located in Baton Rouge, LA, in which green whole bean coffee from our contract with Serengeti Trading Company is then sent to their roaster that they work with, the coffee is roasted/ground/blended with nutraceuticals and then packaged into single-serve containers commonly known as "K cups" and boxed for retail sales.  Pod Pack's roaster can store our nutraceuticals for production in Louisiana.
 
GHT also ships the blended coffee to our location for packing into our new proprietary single serve consumer product, the "Drip Cup".
 
Purchasing of packaging material is well diversified among two suppliers: Fleetwood Fibre & Landsberg. We conduct business with these vendors on a purchase order basis.
 
Machinery for production at our Vista location comes from some of the most respected vendors in the industry: Air compression equipment comes from Kaeser Compressor, manufactured in Germany with a local sales and support office in Los Angeles. Nitrogen generation equipment is manufactured by On-Site Gas Systems, and our Drip Cup production is produced on the leading Japanese manufacturer of packaging machines from NASA Corporation. Nitrogen and air compression machinery is capable of handling expansion as the company expands as well to minimize any ongoing capital expenditures for machinery.
 
Research and Development
 
We focus our research and development efforts on developing innovative functional beverages that not only taste delicious but also include a health-wellness benefit.
 
Over the course of the last fiscal year NuZee has maintained a modest R&D budget.  With the advent of the functional beverage and new product ideas, the Company plans to invest more to secure unique flavor and formula profiles but anticipates the out of pocket expense will not be significant as the Company has agreements with flavor and formula design partners to waive development fees in exchange for purchasing the flavorings and ingredients.
 
In 2017, our research and development activities focused on:
  
● | Drip Cup Kona Blend Coffee Blenders line extension
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Coffee Blenders ready-to-drink line of functional cold brew
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Twin Peaks single serve pour-over and whole bean coffee lines
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

For 2018, our research and development initiatives include:
  
● | Expanding our contract co-packing operation in Vista, CA to accommodate national coffee roasters and grocery chain
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing the exploration of our coffee extraction technologies
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 
NuZee currently owns the following United States trademarks: "Coffee Blenders," "It's Coffee Reimagined," "Nude Cup," "Lean Cup," "Think Cup," "Relax Cup," "Active Cup," "Twin Peaks" (pending), "NuZee," and "Torque.".  The Company intends to continue growing its trademark portfolio in the United States with other related slogans and brands as those products come closer to launch. 
 
The Company further intends to expand its brand protections outside of the United States in line with its prospective international growth.  As of the date of this report, the Company had registered trademarks "Coffee Blenders", "Nude Cup", "Lean Cup", "Think Cup", "Relax Cup" and "Twin Peaks" in Japan and registered trademarks "Lean Cup" and "Think Cup" in Korea.
 
NuZee intends to aggressively protect, police and assert its intellectual property rights, including product designs, proprietary product research and concepts as well as its trademark portfolio.  Although asserting NuZee's rights may result in a substantial cost to the Company, NuZee's management strongly believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.  As a result of our company's continuing R&D efforts, the Company may decide to seek additional protection, if applicable, relating to its formulas, process know-how and proprietary flavors.
 
In exiting the Torque energy supplement product businesses NuZee ceased using and abandon its registered TORQ and TORQ WRENCH trademarks acquired from the HydroPouch Corporation.  The Company also plans to not pursue or contest the use of NuZee as a product brand in association with water and skincare product as we exit those businesses.
 
Competition
 
The beverage industry in general, and the coffee sector in particular, is extremely competitive.  The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns.  Our Coffee Blenders product is competing directly with Green Mountain brands and licensed brands as well as 3rd party single pour over coffees.  While there are more than 200 varieties of single pour over coffees to choose from there are few, if any functional coffees dedicated to weight-loss, stress reduction, cognitive performance and enhanced workout performance.  Green Mountain brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national distribution through well-funded advertising, and product awareness. In addition, companies and brands manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do.
 
Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include taste and functional delivery of our product, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique functions in new and various packaging formats, attractive and unique promotions, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network.
 

14
 


We will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets and search placement in online stores.
 
Our Coffee Blenders products will compete generally with all hot liquid refreshments, including specialty coffees and teas as well as nutraceutical beverages such as BulletProof Coffee, Green Mountain Wellness Coffee, Organo Gold Herbal Coffee, Nuvia Trim Coffee, South Beach Java, Javita, and NatureGift Instant Coffee.  As a result, we continue to look for significant niche markets where our close attention to customer requirements and superior performance are valued.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2017, we had a total of 6 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees.  All employees are located in Vista, CA.
 
Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business.  Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, product development, marketing, and research.  We intend to expand our current management to retain other skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus.  Our management's relationships will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future.  We believe that the skill-set of our core management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks.
 
We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our Coffee Blenders products are marketed and sold as conventional food or beverages for regulatory purposes.  Such products are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").  Ingredients in such products must be approved food additives or "Generally Regarded as Safe" ("GRAS").  We have been careful to utilize ingredients that are approved food additives or GRAS.  We also intend to work with ingredient suppliers, manufacturers, and other trade partners that are compliant with the laws and regulation enforced by the FDA.  We have not received, nor are we aware of, any inquiries or other regulatory action from the FDA or any other governmental agency regarding our products and we believe we are in full compliance with all FDA regulations. 
 
The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, competition laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.
