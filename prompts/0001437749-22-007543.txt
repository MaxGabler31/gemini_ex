--------+---------

 
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops and sells scientifically-created and clinically-proven eyecare and skincare products.
 
Our leading product, Avenova® Antimicrobial Lid and Lash Solution (“Avenova Spray”), is proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties as it removes foreign material including microorganisms and debris from the skin around the eye, including the eyelid. Avenova Spray is formulated with our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid and is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for sale in the United States. Other eyecare products offered under the Avenova eyecare brand include Novawipes by Avenova, Avenova Lubricant Eye Drops, Avenova Moist Heating Eye Compress, and the i-Chek.
 
On November 5, 2021 (the “Acquisition Closing”), we significantly expanded our business by acquiring DERMAdoctor, LLC (“DERMAdoctor”) as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “DERMAdoctor Acquisition”). DERMAdoctor offers over 30 dermatologist-developed products targeting common skin concerns, ranging from aging and blemishes to dry skin, perspiration and keratosis pilaris. DERMAdoctor branded products are marketed and sold through the DERMAdoctor website, well-known traditional and digital beauty retailers, and a network of international distributors.
 
We expect to grow commercial sales of both Avenova and DERMAdoctor branded products through an expansion of domestic and international market penetration, with a particular focus on online channels, and the development of new product offerings under both brand names.
 
Products
 
Avenova Branded Optical Products
 
Avenova Spray is a proprietary solution of hypochlorous acid that acts as an antimicrobial preservative in solution and has been shown to neutralize bacterial toxins in laboratory tests. Because it is a gentle isotonic solution, it is well suited for daily use on the lids and lashes. Avenova Spray offers distinct advantages when compared to alternative lid and lash regimens that contain soaps, bleach, and other impurities, as Avenova Spray removes unwanted microorganisms from the skin without the use of those harmful ingredients. Avenova Spray’s target market is the millions of Americans who suffer from minor irritation of the skin around the eye (commonly referred to as blepharitis) as well as anyone who suffers from dry eye (commonly described as a gritty sandy sensation while blinking). Avenova Spray is available both over-the-counter and as a prescription. We promote Avenova Spray direct to consumers and make it available through Avenova.com, other online channels and at select brick-and-mortar stores. In total, this was our leading sales channel by unit sales and net revenue in 2021. Avenova Spray is also available (1) at optometrists’ and ophthalmologists’ offices, through our physician dispensed channel; (2) at national pharmacy chains across all 50 states; and (3) through our Partner Pharmacy Program, providing a consistent patient experience at contracted pricing.

Because Avenova Spray can be purchased as both an over-the-counter and prescription product, it is available to a wide range of potential customers and addressable markets. Making it available over-the-counter capitalizes on a trend to sell pharmaceutical products directly to consumers in response to increased cost shifting to consumers through high-deductible health plans. Our ongoing focus on promoting Avenova Spray online is reflected in increasing our spend on digital marketing and public relations initiatives. Avenova Spray is available on Avenova.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and select other online channels. Avenova Spray also became available at CVS store locations throughout the U.S. and on CVS.com beginning in the first quarter of 2021.
 
Support from ophthalmologists and optometrists for Avenova Spray remains strong. The continual endorsement of medical professionals has created a “doctor recommended” halo effect around our brand. This is a key differentiating factor in a crowded consumer space and is a result of our high quality and reliable efficacy. Our Buy-and-Sell physician dispensed channel is particularly important in this regard as it gives patients the opportunity to purchase Avenova Spray conveniently and immediately upon recommendation in the doctor’s office. We believe this also creates repeat Avenova Spray customers who subsequently purchase Avenova Spray and often other Avenova branded products through other channels.
 
We also make Avenova Spray accessible nationwide in nearly all retail pharmacies across the United States through agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen Corporation. We continue to build our prescription business under a value pricing model. We maintain a rebate program for electronic payment transactions and in the form of instant rebate cards. The rebate cards are intended to be used by patients who either do not have insurance coverage or whose insurance coverage does not cover Avenova Spray, thereby lowering the price for the patient at the pharmacy.
 
We also have agreements directly with some preferred pharmacy networks through our Partner Pharmacy Program. These agreements provide greater control over the patient experience at consistent contract pricing. Our Partner Pharmacy Program also ensures that proper insurance reimbursement occurs, and that our patients are receiving the best possible price. In 2021, we added ImprimisRx, one of the nation’s leading ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical businesses, to our Partner Pharmacy Program.
 
There are many companies that sell lid and lash solutions, most of which, to the best of our knowledge, are surfactant (soap) based. Unlike these detergent-based products that contain a mix of numerous chemicals, Avenova Spray consists solely of saline and 0.01% pure hypochlorous acid, a molecule naturally produced by the human body. Elegant in its simplicity, Avenova Spray works without the toxic impurities included in competitive offerings. While cheaper antibacterial soaps are commonly used to reduce or prevent bacterial contamination on the skin, we do not view them as true competitors of Avenova Spray.
 
DERMAdoctor Branded Dermatology Products
 
Through the DERMAdoctor Acquisition, we added a comprehensive portfolio of dermatological solutions to address common skincare concerns including: keratosis pilaris, rosacea and eczema, anti-aging, SPF, hyperhidrosis, excessive hair, and acne. These products are organized into several product families, including: (i) Kakadu C®; (ii) KP Duty®; (iii) Total Non-scents Antiperspirant; (iv) Wrinkle Revenge®; (v) AIN’T Misbehavin’®; and (vi) Calm, Cool & Corrected®. DERMAdoctor continues to develop its pipeline of additional new products to address a variety of common skin conditions.
 
DERMAdoctor products are offered within the large and steadily growing skincare category of the beauty industry. The skincare market is divided into facial care, hand and body care and sun care. Within the skincare market, our DERMAdoctor products sell and compete across all major product categories with a wide variety of products at various price points. Skincare products can also be subdivided into prestige and mass segments. Prestige products are characterized by higher price points and are typically sold in high-end specialty stores and department stores.
 
Our marketing strategy for the DERMAdoctor brand is to focus on educating our target consumers about the unique attributes of such products, developing intimate relationships with these consumers and capitalizing on our omni-channel distribution strategy to effectively reach and engage these consumers. Our target demographic for both the Avenova and DERMAdoctor brands encompasses women between the ages of 25 to 65 who have a college education and an above average household income. We plan to continue DERMAdoctor’s efforts to engage in educational media such as appearances on television shows, information and research provided on our websites and physical presence at specialty retailers and department stores, primarily by Dr. Audrey Kunin, to further strengthen the DERMAdoctor brand image and provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about such products. In addition, we also plan to leverage our consumer focused messaging and the products’ pharmaceutical pedigree to create brand awareness through digital marketing, influencers and third-party advertising companies.

The skincare industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes due to consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition in the skincare industry is generally based on the introduction of new products, pricing of products, quality of products and packaging, brand awareness, perceived value and quality, innovation, in-store presence and visibility, promotional activities, advertising, editorials, e-commerce and mobile-commerce initiatives and other activities. These products compete with a high volume of new product introductions and existing products by diverse companies across several different distribution channels, including large multinational consumer products companies that have many skincare brands under ownership, as well as standalone skincare brands, including those that may target the latest trends or specific distribution channels. We expect our DERMAdoctor products to encounter competition for consumer recognition and market share with products that have achieved significant national and international brand name recognition and consumer loyalty, such as those offered by global prestige beauty companies like Avon Products, Inc., Elizabeth Arden, Inc., The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc., L’Oréal Group, Shiseido, Coty, Mary Kay, Inc. and The Proctor & Gamble Company, each of which have skincare brands.
 
NeutroPhase and PhaseOne Branded Wound Care Products
 
Consisting of higher concentrations of hypochlorous acid, NeutroPhase and PhaseOne are used for the cleansing and irrigation of intraoperative pocket lavage, before subcutaneous closure, stage I to IV pressure injuries, stasis ulcers, leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, first-degree and second-degree burns, post-surgical wounds, grafted and donor sites, minor burns, superficial abrasions, wounds, and moistening absorbent wound dressings.
 
Both NeutroPhase and PhaseOne compete in a crowded wound cleanser market with many older and lower-priced products with similar uses, such as Vashe and Betadine Surgical Scrub. However, we believe our NeutroPhase and PhaseOne solutions have distinct competitive advantages because they are made without the toxic chemicals found in other products. NeutroPhase and PhaseOne are gentle, non-irritating, and non-sensitizing to skin and new tissue. PhaseOne is distributed through commercial partners in the United States, and NeutroPhase is distributed in China by Pioneer Pharma (Hong Kong) Company Ltd.
 
DERMAdoctor Acquisition and Financing Transaction 
 
On September 27, 2021, we entered into a Membership Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Purchase Agreement”) by and among (i) us, (ii) DERMAdoctor, (iii) Dr. Jeffrey Kunin and Dr. Audrey Kunin (the “Founders”); (iv) Papillon Partners, Inc., a Missouri corporation that is owned by the Founders (“Papillon”); and (v) Midwest Growth Partners, L.L.L.P., an Iowa limited liability limited partnership (“MGP” and together with Papillon, the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Acquisition Purchase Agreement, we acquired 100% of the membership units of DERMAdoctor for an agreed upon purchase price of approximately $15.0 million (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price was comprised of a payment of approximately $12.0 million in cash to the Sellers at closing, which amount was (i) reduced to account for payments we made to satisfy DERMAdoctor’s indebtedness and its transaction expenses as of closing, and (ii) increased by the DERMAdoctor cash and cash equivalents that remained as of closing. The remaining amount of the Purchase Price is comprised of up to an aggregate of $3.0 million in earn out payments after the Acquisition Closing, which are contingent upon the legacy DERMAdoctor business achieving predetermined contribution margin financial targets for the 2022 and the 2023 calendar fiscal years (the “Earn Out Payments”). DERMAdoctor is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of NovaBay.
 
On October 29, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors (the “Purchasers”). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we agreed to sell in a private placement offering (the “2021 Private Placement”) (i) an aggregate of 15,000 shares of our newly-created Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) convertible into an aggregate of 37,500,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (“Common Stock”), and (ii) warrants (the “2021 Warrants”) exercisable for 37,500,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $15.0 million. The 2021 Private Placement closed on November 2, 2021. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2021 Private Placement to partially fund the Purchase Price of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition, with the remaining amount to be used for working capital purposes.
 
Customers, Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Avenova branded products are available on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, CVS.com and Avenova.com. Online sales now account for the majority of Avenova Spray revenue. Internationally, Avenova Spray is available in Australia through a distribution partner. NeutroPhase and PhaseOne sales rely solely on distribution partners in China and the U.S., respectively.
 
Our DERMAdoctor products are sold in the United States and internationally (including in China, the Middle East, Europe, Canada, and Central and South America). Such products are distributed online, through wholesale distribution, in physical store locations and, particularly as relates to international sales, through marketing and distribution agreements with local partners.
 
For the Avenova Spray, we currently outsource manufacturing to two contract manufacturers with facilities located in the United States. For our DERMAdoctor products, we also use third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain substantially all raw materials, components, and packaging products and to manufacture finished products relating to the DERMAdoctor brand. We utilize a total of seven different product fillers and numerous ingredient and packaging suppliers from which we source and contract the manufactures of our DERMAdoctor products.
 
    3 

  

We believe that we have good relationships with our manufacturers and that our manufacturers have adequate manufacturing capacity to satisfy our demands for all products. Further, we believe that there are often alternative sources available in the event that one or more of these manufacturers are not available. However, the products manufactured by alternative manufacturers may not be identical to our current products as some of our product formulations, particularly as relates to our DERMAdoctor products, are sometimes owned by that particular manufacturer. We continually review our manufacturing needs against the capacity of our contract manufacturers to ensure that we are able to meet our production goals, reduce costs, and operate more efficiently.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to maintain our competitive position. We own over 40 live trademark registrations in the U.S., as well as trademark registrations and pending applications in many other countries internationally, with our primary trademarks including “Avenova®”, “CelleRx®”, “DERMAdoctor®”, “Kakadu C®”, “AIN’T Misbehavin’®”, “KP Duty®” and depictions of Dr. Audrey Kunin, some of which are held directly by NovaBay and others by our wholly-owned subsidiary DERMAdoctor.
 
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by a variety of means, including obtaining patents, maintaining trade secrets and proprietary know-how and technological innovation to operate, without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. In order to maintain our trade secrets, we rely on and use reasonable business activities to protect trade secrets, such as confidentiality/invention rights agreements with employees, confidentiality agreements with manufacturers, proprietary expertise and product formulations, continuing innovation efforts and techniques, and other know-how to develop and maintain a competitive position.
 
Research and Development
 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately $44 thousand and $285 thousand, respectively. DERMAdoctor focuses a significant portion of its product development efforts on creating new products and improving existing products based on feedback and suggestions from its consumers. Many of these suggestions are the catalyst for new DERMAdoctor product development, as well as product extensions. DERMAdoctor’s testing activities are performed by laboratories with ISO 17025 accreditation and FDA registration. The finished products DERMAdoctor develops, including packaging, must meet adequate quality control, and performance tests before they are marketed. Pursuant to our current business strategy, we plan to continue DERMAdoctor’s practice of creating new products and improving existing products in our core product lines by incorporating consumer feedback into our product development efforts.
Seasonality
 
Avenova Branded Products
 
Consistent with our peers in the United States pharmaceutical industry, prescriptions for Avenova Spray experience seasonality with the first quarter of each year typically being the lowest revenue quarter. This annual phenomenon is due to consumers facing the need to satisfy health insurance deductibles and changes to copays as each new insurance year begins. Sales of Avenova Spray through non-prescription channels, along with the other Avenova branded products, experience less seasonality with demands, consistent throughout the year.
 
Dermatology/Skincare Products
 
Our DERMAdoctor products are sold through wholesale distribution relationships with third parties such as Costco and others; therefore, we may receive periodic large orders that result in large chunks of revenue that are received in irregular intervals during the year. Historically, sales of DERMAdoctor products that contain sunscreen and antiperspirants are higher in the summer seasons and sales of DERMAdoctor products that contain moisturizers are higher in the fall and winter months. In addition, DERMAdoctor products will typically experience an uptick in sales during the fourth quarter around the holidays of each country in which its products are sold, particularly in the United States and China.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive government regulation, principally by the FDA and state and local authorities in the United States and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. Governmental authorities in the United States extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, research, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical, medical device and cosmetic products under various federal laws including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and under comparable laws by the states in the United States and in most foreign countries. We also hold our CE Mark and ISO 13485 certifications. To maintain these certifications, we undergo significant quality control audits with the relevant European authorities every year.

FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
Some of our products that we market in the U.S. require FDA 510(k) clearance or approval through the OTC Drug Monograph process. We believe we have obtained the required FDA clearance or approval for each of our current products, if necessary.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (“PMA”). PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III medical devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA process is based on statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification ("PMN") requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The PMN must demonstrate that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device, which is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA's general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the “General Controls”, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) PMN process described below. Avenova Spray is classified as a Class I medical device. None of our products are Class II or Class III medical devices. All DERMAdoctor products are classified either as a cosmetic or an OTC monograph drug.
 
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our marketed devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Reporting Regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements could hurt our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
 
In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law (42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(b)) prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued regulations, known as the safe harbors, which identify permissible practices. If all of the requirements of an applicable safe harbor are met, an arrangement will not be prosecuted under this law. Safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, payments to bona fide employees, certain discount arrangements, and certain payment arrangements involving GPOs. The failure of an arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. However, conduct that does not fully satisfy each requirement of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG or the Department of Justice. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these state laws closely follow the language of the federal law. Some state anti-kickback laws apply regardless of whether a federal health care program payment is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and relationships with health care providers or pharmacies by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with them.
 
Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq.) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program (including Medicaid and Medicare). Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, and imprisonment.
 
    5 

  

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created certain criminal statutes relating to health care, including health care fraud and false statements related to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among others, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to monitor and report certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for disclosure to the public. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing, medical directorships, and other purposes. Some states mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, and some states limit or prohibit such gifts.
 
Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement 
 
Historically, many customers who were prescribed Avenova Spray relied on third-party payors, such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost. As a result, demand of Avenova Spray is partially dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. Private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that private third-party payors will cover and reimburse Avenova Spray or any of our other products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. Currently, none of our products are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and we do not anticipate they will be reimbursed by such programs in the future.
 
Trade Regulation
 
Our products, particularly our DERMAdoctor products, are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of products.
Foreign Regulation
 
Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA, CPSC and FTC. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
 
In addition, we export DERMAdoctor products outside of the United States, and those products are subject to several United States statutes and regulations that regulate exportation from the United States. These products do not require an export license so long as the product is not shipped or otherwise transferred to a comprehensively embargoed country or for a potentially prohibited purpose. DERMAdoctor has developed, maintains and follows internal controls to ensure that it is not exporting its products to embargoed countries or for prohibited purposes.
 
Other U.S. Regulation
 
We must also comply with numerous federal, state, municipal and local laws relating to matters such as health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements.

Human Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis, we had a total of 31 employees, 29 of whom were full-time employees and 2 were part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We comply with the latest employment best practices and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
 
Our principal executive office is located in Emeryville, California. We are party to an Office Lease (the “Lease”), dated August 24, 2016, as subsequently amended on January 24, 2022, pursuant to which we lease approximately 7,675 rentable square feet of real property located on the eleventh floor (Suite 1150) at 2000 Powell Street, Emeryville, California 94608 from KBSIII Towers at Emeryville, LLC (the “Landlord”), for our principal executive offices. The expiration date of the Lease is July 31, 2027, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions of the Lease. We believe that our office and administration facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations and its current purpose, but we may require additional space and facilities as our business expands.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, DERMAdoctor, is party to a lease with Green Bay Packaging Inc., as landlord, and DERMAdoctor, as tenant, dated August 27, 2019 (the “Subsidiary Lease”), for 19,136 square feet of space located at 4346 Belgium Boulevard, Building 2, Riverside, Missouri, which DERMAdoctor utilizes for light manufacturing, storage, distribution of products and administrative functions. The lease commenced on October 1, 2019 and expires on December 31, 2024.
