Our Company
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company driven by our purpose to solve major medical, societal and economic challenges in healthcare. We have a singular focus on one of the greatest global healthcare challenges and burdens - that presented by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, which remains the number one cause of death in the United States and worldwide. We take on that challenge by developing inclisiran, the investigational RNA interference, or RNAi, therapeutic, that specifically inhibits production of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, a key protein that controls LDL-cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels. We believe inclisiran is uniquely suited to make a significant difference reducing risk in ASCVD. We have the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize inclisiran under our collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam.
Inclisiran
Overview
Inclisiran is a subcutaneously administered small interfering RNA, or siRNA, that prevents the production of PCSK9 and is being developed as a potential treatment for hypercholesterolemia. siRNA therapy harnesses a natural mechanism called RNAi. We obtained global rights to this product candidate under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into with Alnylam in February 2013 to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. RNAi is a natural mechanism within cells to selectively prevent the production of specific proteins. PCSK9 is a protein involved in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, receptor levels on cells in the liver (hepatocytes) responsible for cholesterol clearance. Inclisiran prevents the production of PCSK9 and lowers LDL-C levels.
PCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibition 
PCSK9, a member of the serine protease family, plays a key role in controlling the levels of LDL receptors on the surface of certain liver cells called hepatocytes. PCSK9 is expressed and secreted into the bloodstream predominantly by the liver, binds LDL receptors both intracellularly and extracellularly and promotes the lysosomal degradation of these receptors in hepatocytes. By reducing the available LDL receptor pool on the surface of hepatocytes, PCSK9 increases circulating LDL-C levels. People with naturally occurring variants in the PCSK9 gene and consequently lower PCSK9 protein activity have reduced serum LDL-C levels and lower risk for coronary heart disease, with no apparent negative health consequences.
RNA interference 
RNAi, is a natural process within cells to prevent the production of specific proteins and represents a promising aspect of biology and drug development today. Its discovery was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. siRNAs are the molecules that mediate RNAi within cells, and siRNA therapies such as inclisiran harness the natural RNAi process. siRNAs function upstream of today’s medicines by targeting the root cause of diseases. This approach has the potential to transform the care of patients.
Clinical Development
Overview 
Under our global license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam, we and Alnylam initially collaborated on the development of inclisiran and ALN-PCS02, an intravenously administered earlier siRNA therapy. Alnylam was responsible for the development of these product candidates until Phase 1 was completed. We have assumed the responsibility for the further development and commercialization of all product candidates under our agreement with Alnylam. In October 2013, we and Alnylam selected a lead subcutaneously administered development candidate, now referred to as inclisiran, for development for the potential to lower LDL-C. In December 2014, under the terms of our agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran in the United Kingdom. Data from the Phase 1 trial was presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August 2015 and at the American Heart Association meeting in November 2015, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

In January 2016, we began enrolling patients in the ORION-1 Phase 2 dose finding trial. ORION-1 was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia), and elevated LDL-C despite maximally tolerated LDL‑C lowering therapies. The study compared the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluated the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day 180.
In March 2017, we reported positive final results from the ORION-1 Phase 2 study of inclisiran. Efficacy data presented reaffirmed inclisiran’s significant LDL-C lowering effects. Administration of 284 mg of inclisiran (300 mg inclisiran sodium) on Day-1 and Day-90 lowered the mean LDL-C by an average of 52.6% and up to 81% at Day-180. For the subsequent six-month period, from Day-90 to Day-270, the time-averaged LDL-C reduction was 51%. These robust data underscore the potential of a six‑monthly maintenance regimen, which is currently being evaluated in the inclisiran Phase 3 clinical program. No material safety issues were observed on inclisiran in ORION-1, which demonstrated an adverse event profile similar to placebo.
We developed a dose-pharmacodynamic, or dose-PD, response model based on the ORION-1 data to perform modeling and simulation experiments to support the selection of the Phase 3 dose and dose regimen. The dose-PD modeling and simulation supported the clinical observations from ORION-1 that a 300 mg dose given subcutaneously on Day-1, Day-90 and every six months thereafter is the optimal dose and dose regimen for further development in Phase 3. This dose and dose regimen maintains a time‑averaged LDL-C reduction of >50%. Our initial Phase 3 program, described below, will test this dose and dose regimen in patients with ASCVD, ASCVD-risk equivalents, or familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH. Further dose-PD response modeling and simulation demonstrated that a 300 mg dose given once a year would result in a time‑averaged LDL-C reduction of approximately 43‑45%. We believe that this once a year dose regimen of 300 mg of inclisiran could be tested in patient populations at lower cardiovascular risk for whom daily oral tablets remain a challenge.
In January 2017, we initiated the ORION-2 and ORION-3 studies. ORION-2 is a pilot study to examine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of inclisiran in a limited number of patients with homozygous FH, to support further evaluation in the larger ORION-5 trial (described below). The ORION-3 study is an open label extension study of ORION-1 with the objective to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of long‑term dosing of inclisiran. ORION-3 will also assess the feasibility of switching to inclisiran from evolocumab (trade named Repatha) on certain clinical and patient-reported endpoints.

Phase 3 Clinical Program - ORION 5, 9, 10 and 11 clinical trials. 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated the Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program for inclisiran. The Phase 3 program is comprised of four pivotal clinical trials in patients with ASCVD, ASCVD-risk equivalents, heterozygous FH, and homozygous FH. We anticipate that data from three trials, ORION-9, ORION-10 and ORION-11, will support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, in the United States and a marketing authorization application, or MAA, in the European Union at or around the end of 2019. In the ORION-9, ORION-10 and ORION-11 trials, patients will be studied for 18 months and inclisiran 284 mg (inclisiran sodium 300 mg) will be given subcutaneously on Day-1, Day-90 and every six months thereafter for a total of four doses during the 18‑month study period. We expect patients in the ORION-5 trial of inclisiran in patients with homozygous FH to have a shorter comparative treatment window than the patients in the other ORION Phase 3 trials. The four Phase 3 clinical trials are further described below:

Study | Sites | Main inclusion criteria | Patients 
ORION-5 | US, EU, South Africa (SA) | Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH | 45 (estimated)
ORION-9 | US, EU, SA | Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH | 482 
ORION-10 | US | ASCVD | 1,561 
ORION-11 | EU, SA | ASCVD and risk equivalent patients | 1,617 
 | | | 3,705 

ORION-5 is a two-part (double-blind, placebo-controlled/open label) multicenter study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of inclisiran in approximately 45 subjects with HoFH. We commenced enrollment in the ORION-5 trial in February 2019. On January 23, 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for inclisiran for the treatment of HoFH.

ORION-9 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in approximately 482 patients with HeFH. The primary endpoint of ORION‑9 study is LDL-C reduction from baseline at Day-510. The ORION-9 trial commenced in November 2017. In February 2018, we announced that this trial had exceeded its target enrollment of 400 patients.
ORION-10 is a placebo-controlled, double‑blind, randomized study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in approximately 1,561 patients with ASCVD and LDL‑C levels above 70 mg/dL despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies including statins. The primary endpoint of ORION-10 study is LDL-C reduction from baseline at Day-510. The ORION-10 trial commenced in November 2017 and in March 2018, we announced that this trial had exceeded its target enrollment of 1,500 patients.
ORION-11 is a placebo‑controlled, double‑blind, randomized study of inclisiran versus placebo (1:1) in approximately 1,617 patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-risk equivalents and elevated LDL-C levels above 70 mg/dL or 100 mg/dL, respectively, despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies including statins. The primary endpoint of the study is LDL-C reduction from baseline at Day-510. The ORION-11 trial commenced in November 2017. In January 2018, we announced that this trial had exceeded its target enrollment of 1,500 patients.

Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial - ORION-4
We are also conducting a cardiovascular outcomes trial in approximately 15,000 patients with ASCVD on a background of standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy (usually high intensity statins), to determine the effects of inclisiran on cardiovascular outcomes. We initiated enrollment in the trial in October 2018. The overall design of the ORION-4 outcomes trial has been agreed to with the FDA and EMA. The ORION-4 study will be conducted in close collaboration with the academic groups, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit of the University of Oxford and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, as well as other scientific experts. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be a composite endpoint of coronary heart disease death, non‑fatal myocardial infarction, fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke and urgent coronary revascularization. These endpoints have been demonstrated to be modifiable in previous, similar outcomes trials with lipid modifying therapies. The duration of the outcomes trial will be long enough, with a median of four to five years follow‑up, to accumulate a sufficient number of events to ascertain treatment group differences and demonstrate the maximum clinical effect size associated with LDL-C lowering. We anticipate that, if inclisiran is approved for sale and the outcomes trial is successful, we will submit the results of the outcomes trial to the FDA as a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, and as a variation to the MAA with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.
Medical Need
Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, resulting in over 18 million deaths annually. Eighty-five percent of all cardiovascular disease deaths are due to coronary heart disease or strokes. Not merely a disease of the elderly, cardiovascular disease is responsible for more than a third of the 17 million premature deaths annually worldwide, causing substantial losses in economic productivity. 
Elevated LDL-C is the primary cause of ASCVD and the most readily modifiable risk factor, and of itself a major cause of years of life lost. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that reducing LDL-C directly leads to improved cardiovascular outcomes, the clinical risk reduction is linearly-proportional to absolute LDL-C reduction, with each 39 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C yielding a 22% reduction in major coronary events after 12 months of continuous treatment.
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapies, predominantly statins, to reduce LDL-C and the associated risk of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke or associated events. Yet cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death, highlighting the unmet medical need for additional treatment options for lowering LDL-C. Statins are effective, but are associated with well‑known limitations. First, high-intensity oral therapies do not get all patients to LDL-C goals. This is particularly important in patients with pre‑existing coronary heart disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, and/or diabetes, who are at the highest risk and require the most intensive management. Second, not all patients tolerate statins and many are unable to tolerate them at sufficiently high doses. Third, observational studies have demonstrated that >50% of patients do not adhere to oral therapies including statins for more than six months, leaving them completely unprotected against risk of cardiovascular events, including death.
We believe that new long-acting treatment with significant, durable lowering of LDL-C can fulfill important unmet efficacy needs in ASCVD treatment and prevention. Clinical studies performed with inclisiran have demonstrated reductions in LDL-C by more than 50%, when given on top of other lipid lowering therapies, and therefore has the potential to meet this unmet need for additional significant LDL-C reduction. In addition, we believe that inclisiran’s twice-a-year dosing administered by a health-care professional aligns with common approaches to care including how often physicians follow up with ASCVD patients. Twice-a-year administration of an LDL-C lowering therapy by a health-care professional can circumvent the challenges of treatment adherence,

which has been a significant problem with more frequently dosed therapies and has hampered the ability to make progress against heart disease.
Business Development Strategy
On November 3, 2015, we announced that we were in the process of evaluating our operations with a goal of unlocking and maximizing stockholder value. In particular, we stated our intention was to explore strategies for optimizing our capital structure and liquidity position and to narrow our operational focus by strategically separating non-core businesses and products in order to generate non-dilutive cash and reduce associated cash burn and capital requirements. 
As a result of our decision to narrow our operational focus, we have completed the following transactions and are now focused on the development of inclisiran as a transformative treatment for ASCVD:
Sale of Angiomax. On August 22, 2018, we completed the sale of our rights to branded Angiomax in the United States to Sandoz Inc., or Sandoz, for $9.9 million. Prior to the divestiture, Sandoz had been selling an authorized generic of Angiomax (bivalirudin) as of July 2, 2015 pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with us. As a result of the divestiture, Sandoz is the holder of the NDA for Angiomax in the United States and will be responsible for manufacturing and supply of Angiomax in the second quarter of 2019. In February 2019, we sold our rights to branded Angiomax in Canada to Sandoz AG for $500,000 and, as a result of the transaction, Sandoz AG is the holder of the marketing authorization for Angiomax in Canada and is responsible for manufacturing and supply of Angiomax.
Sale of Infectious Disease Products. On January 5, 2018, we completed the sale of our infectious disease portfolio, consisting of the products Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin IV and line extensions thereof, and substantially all of the assets related thereto, other than certain pre-clinical assets, to Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., or Melinta. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $166.4 million and 3,313,702 shares of Melinta common stock having a market value, based on Melinta's closing share price on January 5, 2018, of approximately $54.5 million. In addition, we are entitled to receive (i) a cash payment payable 12 months following the closing of the transaction equal to $25 million; (ii) a cash payment payable 18 months following the closing of the transaction equal to $25 million; and (iii) tiered royalty payments of 5% to 25% on worldwide net sales of (a) Vabomere and (b) Orbactiv and Minocin IV, collectively. In addition, Melinta assumed our obligation to make a $30 million milestone payment to the former owners of the infectious disease business, which we refer to as the Vabomere Milestone Payment, upon receipt of regulatory approval of Vabomere by the European Medicines Agency, which approval was received by Melinta in November 2018. We remain ultimately responsible to pay the Vabomere Milestone Payment under our agreement with the former owners of the infectious disease business; however we believe that we are responsible for such payment only if the former owners of the infectious disease business are unable to collect from Melinta after exercising due diligence in attempting to collect from Melinta before seeking to collect from us. None of the future payments due from Melinta are secured by collateral. In December 2018, Melinta filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware alleging that we breached certain representations and warranties in the purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Melinta acquired our infectious disease business. In connection with the lawsuit, Melinta is seeking indemnification under the purchase and sale agreement and notified us that it would not be paying the Vabomere Milestone Payment or the first of two $25 million deferred payments due to us under the purchase and sale agreement because Melinta believes it has the right to set-off such payments against its claimed damages in its lawsuit. See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceeding of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our litigation with Melinta.
In October 2018, we divested certain pre-clinical infectious disease assets not acquired by Melinta, which included the funding agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The assets were purchased by Qpex Biopharma, Inc., or Qpex, a new company formed by a syndicate of venture firms led by New Enterprise Associates and accompanied by Adams Street Partners, LYZZ Capital, Hatteras Venture Partners and Stanford University Draper Fund. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $2.7 million and are entitled to receive up to $29 million upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the pre-clinical assets. In addition, Qpex assumed potential milestone payments due under our agreement with Rempex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rempex, related to the development of the pre-clinical assets.
Sale of Non-Core Cardiovascular Products. On June 21, 2016, we completed the sale of Cleviprex, Kengreal and rights to Argatroban for Injection, which we refer to collectively as Non-Core ACC Assets, to Chiesi USA, Inc., or Chiesi USA, and its parent company Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, Chiesi and Chiesi USA acquired our Non-Core ACC Assets and related assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities arising out of the operation of the businesses and the acquired assets after closing, including any obligations with respect to future milestones relating to each of the products. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $263.8 million in cash, which included the value of product inventory, and may receive up to an additional $480.0 million in the aggregate following the achievement of certain specified calendar 
 5

year net sales milestones with respect to net sales of each of Cleviprex and Kengreal. As part of the transaction to sell Non-Core ACC Assets, we sublicensed to Chiesi all of our rights to Cleviprex and Kengreal under our license from AstraZeneca. Subsequent to the completion of the sale, these sublicenses from us to Chiesi were terminated, Chiesi purchased from AstraZeneca all or substantially all of AstraZeneca’s assets relating to Cleviprex and Kengreal, the parties released certain claims against one another, and we paid Chiesi $7.5 million.
Sale of Hemostasis Business. On February 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our hemostasis business, consisting of PreveLeak, Raplixa and Recothrom products to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mallinckrodt plc, or Mallinckrodt. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, Mallinckrodt acquired all of the outstanding equity of Tenaxis Medical, Inc. and ProFibrix B.V. and assets exclusively related to the Recothrom product. Mallinckrodt assumed all liabilities arising out of Mallinckrodt's operation of the businesses and the acquired assets after closing, including all obligations with respect to milestones relating to the PreveLeak and Raplixa products. At the completion of the sale, we received approximately $174.1 million in cash from Mallinckrodt, and may receive up to an additional $235.0 million in the aggregate following the achievement of certain specified calendar year net sales milestones with respect to net sales of PreveLeak and Raplixa. The amount paid at closing was subject to a post-closing purchase price adjustment process with respect to the Recothrom inventory and the net working capital of the hemostasis business as of the date of the closing. In the first quarter of 2018, Mallinckrodt announced it would no longer commercialize Raplixa and sold Recothrom and PreveLeak to Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, with Baxter assuming the sales milestones associated with PreveLeak.
In addition to the transactions above, consistent with our intentions announced in November 2015, after seeking opportunities to partner or divest Ionsys, our fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, in June 2017 we commenced a voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market and ceased related commercialization activities, with the regulatory authorizations for Ionsys remaining open until the third quarter 2018. 
Alnylam License Agreement
In February 2013, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic products targeting the PCSK9 gene based on certain of Alnylam’s RNAi technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we obtained the exclusive, worldwide right under Alnylam’s technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize PCSK9 products for the treatment, palliation and/or prevention of all human diseases. We paid Alnylam $25.0 million in an initial license payment and agreed to pay up to $180.0 million in success-based development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. In December 2014, we paid a development milestone payment of $10.0 million based upon the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for inclisiran and in January 2018 we paid a development milestone payment of $20.0 million based upon the initiation of our phase 3 study for inclisiran. In addition, Alnylam will be eligible to receive scaled double-digit royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of PCSK9 products by us or our affiliates and sublicensees. Royalties to Alnylam are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the last to occur of the expiration of patent rights in the applicable country that cover the applicable product, the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivities for such product in such country, and the twelfth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. The royalties are subject to reduction in specified circumstances. We are also responsible for paying royalties, and in some cases milestone payments, owed by Alnylam to its licensors with respect to intellectual property covering these products. Alnylam was responsible for developing the lead product through the end of the first Phase 1 clinical trial and to supply the lead product for the first Phase 1 clinical trial and the first phase 2 clinical trial. Alnylam bore the costs for these activities. We are responsible for all other development, manufacturing and commercialization activities under the agreement.
The agreement expires when the last royalty term expires under the agreement, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the agreement at any time with four months prior written notice to Alnylam. Either party may terminate the agreement on 60 days (10 days in the event of a payment breach) prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period. Such cure period may be extended in certain circumstances. If the agreement is terminated by us for convenience or by Alnylam for our uncured material breach or challenge of the patents licensed from Alnylam, we have agreed to grant a license to Alnylam under certain of its technology developed in the course of our activities under the agreement, subject to a royalty to be negotiated between the parties, and we will provide certain other assistance to Alnylam to continue the development and commercialization of the products. The exclusivity restrictions imposed on us will survive termination of the agreement for specified periods of time if we terminate the agreement for convenience or if Alnylam terminates the agreement for cause or for a patent challenge by us.
Sales and Distribution
 6

Following the divestiture of our rights to branded Angiomax to Sandoz in August 2018, we no longer market any products. Since July 2015, Sandoz had the exclusive right to sell bivalirudin (250 mg/ml) in the United States under our approved NDA for Angiomax but labeled and sold under the Sandoz name, which we refer to herein as authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin), pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement we entered into with Sandoz. Prior to the divestiture to Sandoz, we distributed branded Angiomax in the United States through a sole source distribution model with Integrated Commercialization Solutions, or ICS. ICS then primarily sold branded Angiomax to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the United States. Our agreement with ICS provided that ICS would be our exclusive distributor of branded Angiomax in the United States. Under the terms of this fee-for-service agreement, ICS placed orders with us for sufficient quantities to maintain an appropriate level of inventory based on our customers’ historical purchase volumes. ICS assumed all credit and inventory risks, was subject to our standard return policy and had sole responsibility for determining the prices at which it sold these products, subject to specified limitations in the agreement. The agreement was terminated in February 2019.
Historically, we also marketed and sold Angiomax outside the United States, principally through distributor relationships. These distributors included Sandoz Canada Inc., which distributed Angiomax in Canada and currently holds marketing rights to Angiomax in Canada, and affiliates of Grupo Ferrer Internacional who distributed Angiox in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain and in a number of countries in Central America and South America. We also had agreements with other third parties for other countries outside of the United States. We have discontinued and withdrawn, or are in the process of voluntarily discontinuing and withdrawing, Angiomax from the market outside of North America and have ceased related commercialization activities. We have also entered into a strategic collaboration with SciClone Pharmaceuticals, or SciClone, under which we granted SciClone a license and the exclusive rights to promote, market and sell Angiomax in China upon its approval. 
Manufacturing
We do not have a manufacturing infrastructure and we do not intend to develop one. We are currently a party to clinical agreements, and are negotiating commercial agreements, with contract manufacturers for the supply of bulk drug substance for inclisiran and with other third parties for the formulation, packaging and distribution of inclisiran. Our product manufacturing operation is comprised of professionals with expertise in pharmaceutical manufacturing, product development, logistics and supply chain management and quality management and supply chain compliance. These professionals oversee the manufacturing and distribution of inclisiran by third-party companies. 
Inclisiran
Under our agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam supplied the quantity of finished product required for the conduct of the first Phase 1 clinical trial and the first Phase 2 clinical trial of inclisiran. Alnylam bore the costs of these activities, subject to certain agreed-upon caps. We have the sole right and responsibility to manufacture and supply licensed product for further development and commercialization under our development plan. We and Alnylam entered into a development supply agreement under which Alnylam agreed to transfer the manufacturing technology for the product to us or our third-party manufacturers. We have entered into agreements with two contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacture of clinical supplies of drug substance, and another manufacturing organization for the supply of drug product for use in clinical and non-clinical studies. Subsequent to the completion of Phase 2 all clinical and non-clinical materials have been directly sourced from suppliers by us. 
Bulk Drug Substance. On October 27, 2016, we entered into a services and supply agreement with Agilent Technologies, or Agilent, to supply inclisiran sodium manufactured by a chemical solid phase oligonucleotide based process. Agilent has supplied a number of batches using this process that have been used in drug product manufacture for clinical studies. Further on December 9, 2015, we entered into a services and supply agreement, as amended on July 27, 2016, with Nitto Denko Avecia for the technical transfer and manufacture of inclisiran sodium. We have an agreement with Alnylam for the supply of GalNAc-resin, a key starting material through process validation. Additionally, we and Alnylam are transferring technology and relationships for the manufacturer of GalNAc-resin and associated components to third parties jointly selected by us and Alnylam for the manufacture of commercial supplies of GalNAc-succinate and GalNAc-resin.
Drug Product. On June 3, 2016, we entered into a master service agreement with Alcami Corporation to develop processes and methods for the manufacture of inclisiran drug product. Under the agreement, Alcami has manufactured all of the inclisiran sodium vials and placebo vials used to date in clinical and non-clinical studies.
Additionally, on September 25, 2017, we entered into a technology transfer and manufacturing service agreement with Corden Pharma for the development and manufacture of pre-filled syringes of inclisiran sodium and placebo for use in clinical studies. To date Corden Pharma has manufactured all of the pre-filled syringes used in Phase 3 clinical studies. 
Competition 
 7

The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition from pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities and experience, and financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
In addition, our competitors may develop, market or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that have been or are being developed by us, or may obtain marketing approval for their products from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We expect to compete on the basis of product efficacy, safety, ease of administration, price and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed.
Inclisiran
The market targeting hypercholesterolemia is highly competitive. Inclisiran is being evaluated when given in combination with maximally tolerated first line therapy consisting of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins. If approved, we expect inclisiran to compete with the two currently approved and marketed anti-PCSK9 antibodies, Amgen’s Repatha and Sanofi’s Praluent, which are indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Europe. In addition, other LDL-C lowering therapies, including PCSK9-targeted approaches, are in development at a number of companies. Oral products that lower LDL-C, if approved, include Bempedoic Acid (ETC-1002), which is being developed by Esperion Therapeutics Inc., and gemcabene, which is being developed by Gemphire Therapeutics Inc. Other RNA-targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA therapies, are also in development and may also be competitive with inclisiran, if approved. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect the products we acquire or license by obtaining and maintaining patent protection both in the United States and in other countries. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, contractual restrictions and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We plan to prosecute and defend patents or patent applications we file, acquire or license.
Inclisiran. We have exclusively licensed from Alnylam patents and patent applications covering RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases for purposes of developing and commercializing such RNAi therapeutics. In November 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent No. 10,125,369, or the ‘369 patent. The ‘369 patent contains claims directed to specific compositions of the inclisiran product we are developing and methods of administrating such compositions and is set to expire in June 2034 (not including any patent term or pediatric extensions). In addition, some of the patents licensed from Alnylam are directed to general RNAi technology and expire between 2020 and 2028 in the United States. Other patents cover compositions of the inclisiran product being developed under our license from Alnylam and methods of treatment using such inclisiran product, and the patents expire in 2027 and 2028 in the United States. In addition, we and Alnylam have filed and are prosecuting a number of patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign countries.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us can be uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the patent applications we acquire, license or file will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 and patent applications filed within the last 18 months are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office. Participation in these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Even issued patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology.
The development of hypercholesterolemia products and RNAi therapeutics are intensely competitive. A number of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or received patents in these fields. Some of these patent applications could be competitive with applications we have acquired or licensed, or could conflict in certain respects with claims made under our applications. Such conflict could result in a significant reduction of the coverage of the patents we have acquired or licensed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial

condition and results of operations. In addition, if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims with claims of our patents and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may not be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, or develop or obtain alternative technology.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques. Others may also otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
We have a number of trademarks that we consider important to our business. The Medicines Company® name and logo are either our registered trademarks or our trademarks in the United States and other countries. We have also registered some of these marks in a number of foreign countries. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration. We believe that our products are identified by our trademarks and, thus, our trademarks are of significant value. Each registered trademark has a duration of 10 to 15 years, depending on the date it was registered and the country in which it is registered, and is subject to an infinite number of renewals for a like period upon continued use and appropriate application. We intend to continue the use of our trademarks and to renew our registered trademarks based upon each trademark’s continued value to us.
Customers 
In the United States, we sold branded Angiomax, until our divesture of the products to Sandoz in August 2018, to our sole source distributor, ICS. At December 31, 2017, amounts due from ICS represented approximately $2.9 million, or 27%, of gross accounts receivable. We also had a supply and distribution arrangement with Sandoz under which Sandoz sold authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin) in the United States. We generated total net revenue under the sales and distribution arrangement with Sandoz by making products sales to Sandoz and received royalty payments from Sandoz in respect of Sandoz’s sales of authorized generic Angiomax (bivalirudin). Product sales and royalty revenues from Sandoz accounted for 143% and 81% of our net revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2017, amounts due from Sandoz represented approximately $5.1 million or 48.2%, of gross accounts receivable. 
Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, advertising, promotion, storage, sales, distribution, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our products and product candidates. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act respectively and their implementing regulations. We cannot market or commercially distribute a drug until we have submitted an application for marketing authorization to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. Both before and after approval is obtained, violations of regulatory requirements may result in various adverse consequences, including, among other things, clinical holds, untitled letters, warning letters, fines and other monetary penalties, the FDA’s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall or seizure, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, interruption of production, operating restrictions, injunctions and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The steps required before a drug may be approved by the FDA and marketed in the United States generally include:

• | pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;

 9


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Pre-Clinical Tests
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, clinical study protocol(s), and other information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA puts the trial on clinical hold because of concerns or questions about issues such as the design of the clinical trial(s) or the safety of the drug for administration to humans. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND does not necessarily result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. In addition, the FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time which includes during an ongoing clinical trial if, for example, safety concerns arise, in which case the trial cannot recommence without the FDA’s authorization. A clinical hold can result in a substantial delay and expense.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, and the effectiveness criteria, or endpoints, to be evaluated. Each protocol intended to study investigational new drugs in the United States must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA may or may not allow that trial to proceed. Each trial also must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each proposed study site before it can begin.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. 

• | Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into people to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. 


• | Phase 3 trials usually involve administration of the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate safety, and statistically evaluate the efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

We cannot guarantee that Phase 3 testing of inclisiran will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the IRB, or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
Sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and are subject to civil money penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for failing to meet these obligations.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA or BLA typically requires the payment of a significant user fee to FDA. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs or BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Before approving an application, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA also often inspects one or more sites at which the pivotal clinical trial or trials were conducted to ensure the integrity of the data and compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements. If the FDA determines the application, data or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If the FDA evaluation of the NDA and the various inspections are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug 
 10

with specific prescribing information for a specific indication(s). As a condition of approval of an application, the FDA may request or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose requirements designed to ensure the safety of the drug up to and including distribution and use restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval before the changes can be implemented. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Product approvals may be further limited or withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or safety or other problems are identified following initial marketing.
The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center, and often will require approval of only a single application, such as an NDA or BLA. The FDA’s Office of Combination Products, or OCP, determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product’s “primary mode of action.” A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. 
Manufacturing Requirements
After the FDA approves a product, we, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers must comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and our contract manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. In addition, discovery of problems such as safety problems may result in changes in labeling, imposition or modification of a REMS, or other restrictions on a product manufacturer, or NDA or BLA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
We use and will continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and we cannot be sure that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. The FDA may approve an ANDA if the product is the same in important respects as the listed drug or if the FDA has declared it suitable for an ANDA submission. In these situations, applicants must submit studies showing that the product is bioequivalent to the listed drug, meaning that the rate and extent of absorption of the drug does not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Conducting bioequivalence studies is generally less time-consuming and costly than conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials necessary to support an NDA or BLA. Drugs approved via ANDAs on the basis that they are the “same” as a listed drug are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be and are substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. For example, a number of ANDAs have been filed and approved with respect to Angiomax. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and until the outcomes of our effort to extend the patent term and our patent infringement litigation, we may not know the disposition of such ANDA submissions.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. An ANDA applicant relying upon a listed drug is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the listed drug product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

• | the required patent information has not been filed;

 11


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.

A certification that the proposed generic product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notice automatically prevents the FDA from granting final approval to the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity period, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, for the referenced product has expired, unless the exclusivity period protects an indication or other aspect of labeling that can be “carved out” of the labeling for the proposed generic product. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA if a listed drug contains a previously approved active moiety but FDA requires as a condition of approval new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination, or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. For written requests issued by the FDA after September 27, 2007, the date of enactment of the Food and Drug Administrative Amendment Act, or FDAAA, the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than nine months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivity in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to that exclusivity period. 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication(s) sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would be required to do so. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be prevented until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, enacted in the United States in 2010, the FDA now has the authority to approve biosimilar and interchangeable versions of previously-approved biological products through an abbreviated pathway following periods of data and marketing exclusivity. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, also known as a reference product, address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data which the FDA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis. A competitor seeking approval of an interchangeable biological product must demonstrate not only biosimilarity but also that the products can be expected to produce the same clinical effects in any given patient. Under the data protection provisions of this 
 12

law, the FDA cannot accept a biosimilar application until four years, or approve a biosimilar application until 12 years, after initial marketing approval of the reference product. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance documents, to date it has not issued any regulations or final guidance explaining how it will implement the abbreviated BLA or biosimilar provisions enacted in 2010 under the BPCIA, including the exclusivity provisions for reference products. Regulators in the European Union and other countries also have been given the authority to approve biosimilars. The extent to which biosimilars are treated as interchangeable with or substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. A number of states have recently considered and, in some cases, adopted legislation governing the substitution of interchangeable biosimilars for the reference product.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
We are continually evaluating the impact of healthcare reform-related programs and regulations on our business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not identified any provisions that currently materially impact our business and results of operations. However, the potential impact of healthcare reform measures on our business and results of operations is inherently difficult to predict because many of the details regarding the implementation of this legislation have not been determined. In addition, the impact on our business and results of operations may change as and if our business evolves. President Trump and HHS Secretary Azar have announced support for regulatory provisions that would limit a number of healthcare reform programs initiated under the Obama administration, and have proposed or are considering additional reforms. It remains unclear whether these reforms will include similar limitations affecting reimbursement, although scrutiny over drug pricing and government costs is expected to continue. Similarly, efforts in Congress to reform Medicare and Medicaid may impact the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of inclisiran, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the product will be covered by third-party payers, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive health economic studies in order to demonstrate the economics of the product, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if a drug product is covered, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and economic benefit of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider inclisiran to be economically beneficial compared to other available therapies, they may not cover it after approval as a benefit under their plans. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of inclisiran to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for inclisiran.
 13

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Foreign Regulations
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee for each clinical trial, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed in that country.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or BLA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Drugs can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralised authorisation procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralised EMA Procedure.  The EMA, formerly the EMEA, implemented the centralised procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorisations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorisation issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralised procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralised marketing authorisation to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
National Procedures.  There are also three other possible routes to authorize medicinal products outside the scope of the centralised procedure and the EMA:

• | National procedures. A medicine is authorised in one European Union member state in accordance with the national procedures of that country. If a marketing authorisation holder wishes to apply subsequently for additional marketing authorisations in other member states for that product, the mutual recognition procedure must be used.


• | Decentralised procedure. Using the decentralised procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralised procedure. 

 14


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country, as described above. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

Research and Development 
Our research and development expenses, excluding discontinued operations, totaled $133.0 million in 2018, $138.4 million in 2017 and $92.1 million in 2016.
Employees
As of February 25, 2019 we employed approximately 62 persons worldwide. We believe that our success depends greatly on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. We have assembled a management team with significant experience in drug development and commercialization. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Workforce Restructuring
In 2017 and 2018, we conducted a series of workforce reductions, as described below. Our intention was to reduce our personnel to less than 60 employees. Upon signing release agreements, affected employees received a severance package, including reduction payments and fully paid health care coverage and outplacement services for six months to a year.
In June 2017, in connection with our voluntary discontinuation and withdrawal of Ionsys from the market in the United States, we commenced a workforce reduction, which resulted in the reduction of 57 employees, which represented approximately 15% of our workforce. 
Commencing in December 2017 and continuing through 2018, we implemented a series of workforce reductions to focus on inclisiran, improve efficiencies and better align costs and structure. Through December 31, 2018, 136 employees have been terminated and 137 employees were transferred as part of the sale of the infectious disease business unit to Melinta. These workforce reductions are expected to reduce headcount costs included in operating expenses by approximately $74.0 million on an annualized basis.
