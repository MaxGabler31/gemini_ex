ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
Zynex Inc. was founded by Thomas Sandgaard in 1996, when he founded smaller private companies that eventually were folded into Zynex, Inc.  Zynex Inc., a Nevada corporation,  that was formed in December 2001, is the parent company of and conducts business within six subsidiaries: Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI”), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Neurodiagnostics, Inc. (“ZND”), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS”), a Colorado corporation, Zynex Billing and Consulting, LLC (“ZBC”), a Colorado limited liability company, Zynex Europe (Zynex Europe ApS) (“ZEU”), a Danish corporation, and Pharmazy, Inc. (“Pharmazy”), which was incorporated under the laws of Colorado in June 2015 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZMI collectively referred to as “Zynex” or the “Company”.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s only active subsidiary is Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) through which the Company conducts most of its operations. One other subsidiary, Zynex Europe, ApS (“ZEU,” a wholly-owned Denmark corporation), generated minimal revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 from international sales and marketing. Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) has developed a blood volume monitoring device which is in the process of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the United States of American and CE Marking in Europe. As a result, ZMS has achieved no revenues to date. Its inactive subsidiaries include Zynex NeuroDiagnostics, Inc. (“ZND,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation), Zynex Billing and Consulting, LLC (“ZBC,” an 80% owned Colorado limited liability company) and Pharmazy, Inc. (“Pharmazy”), which was incorporated in June 2015 as a wholly-owned Colorado corporation. The Company’s compound pharmacy operated as a division of ZMI dba as Pharmazy through January 2016.
 
Over 99% of total 2016 and 2017 consolidated revenue is attributable to ZMI. Our headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado.
 
Subsidiaries
 
Zynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI): ZMI designs, manufactures and markets medical devices that treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. ZMI devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on drugs and medications and provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (“IFC”), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (“NMES”) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”). All our medical devices are intended to be patient friendly and designed for home use. The ZMI devices are small, portable, battery operated and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. The products are cost effective when compared to traditional physical therapy, and often result in better mobility, less pain and increased potential for a patient to return to work and live a fuller life significantly earlier than with traditional therapies alone. All of our medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and are subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation and approval.  Our products require a physician’s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. We consider the physician’s prescription as an “order”, and it is on this basis that we provide the product to the patient and either bill the patient directly or the patient’s private or government insurer for payment. ZMI’s primary product is the NexWave device.  The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by our field sales representatives.   The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients on a recurring monthly basis, as needed.  
 
ZMI also designs, manufactures and markets the NeuroMove product. The NeuroMove contains electromyography and electric stimulation technology that is primarily used for stroke, spinal cord and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation (“SCI”), by reaching parts of the brain to re-connect with muscles, also known as neuroplasticity.  The NeuroMove product is primarily marketed to medical clinics. Zynex did not have material sales of this product in 2016 or 2017.
 
Zynex Medical, Inc. dba Pharmazy (ZMI) and Pharmazy, Inc (Pharmazy):
 
In 2012,  many industry sales representatives, including those representing Zynex, began offering prescription TransDermal Pain Creams (TDPC) to their accounts, a product that paid much higher commissions with less paperwork than TENS devices.  TDPC, like TENS, offers very effective, non-addictive pain management with minimal side effects. In late 2013, Zynex opened a compound pharmacy to enter the prescription TransDermal Pain Cream (“TDPC”) market. The new pharmacy operated within ZMI, (ZMI dba “Pharmazy”) and obtained its first state license in February 2014. In June 2015, we incorporated Pharmazy, Inc. in Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary of ZMI. During January 2016, we shut down our compound pharmacy business.  The business struggled due to the unfavorably changing pharmacy insurance reimbursements. In addition, we focused on our core electrotherapy product business and our potential and future blood volume monitor business described for ZMS, below.
Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):
 
ZMS was formed in 2011 to develop and market medical devices for non-invasive cardiac monitoring. During 2015, ZMS was still in development and did not have any revenue. The blood volume monitor is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring central blood volume that would be used in operating and recovery rooms to detect blood loss during surgery and internal bleeding during recovery. This device has been subjected to multiple clinical studies, which are being utilized for collecting data to further validate the algorithm used to determine changes in central blood volume and planning for future, additional clinical studies. We have submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA and are responding to their questions. There is no guarantee when or if the product will be cleared for marketing by the FDA.

Concurrent to our FDA application, we are pursuing European Union (“EU”) Certificate European (“CE”) Marking. CE Marking is a certification that a product meets the standards established by the 28 nations of the EU and qualifies for sale in the EU and 4-nation European Free Trade Association.
 
The blood volume monitor has been tested in several International Review Board (“IRB”) approved studies and, during 2015, was used in several blood donation settings where hundreds of subjects have donated half a liter of blood with strong correlation to the index on the device. We have built a number of commercial devices in pilot-production and continue to refine the algorithms for the Blood Volume Index (BVI). Two utility patents have been filed for this unique application (pending), which we believe could serve a currently unmet need in the market for safer surgeries and safer monitoring of patients during recovery. ZMS did not produce any revenue for the years ending December, 31, 2017 and 2016. 
 
Zynex International (Zynex Europe) (ZEU):
 
ZEU was formed in 2012 to further progress Zynex’s international expansion. ZEU is currently conducting business and focused on sales and marketing our products within the international marketplace, upon receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. ZEU did not produce significant revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Zynex NeuroDiagnostics (ZND):
 
ZND was formed in 2011 to market electromyography (“EMG”), electroencephalography (“EEG”), sleep pattern, auditory and nerve conductivity neurological diagnosis devices to hospitals and clinics worldwide, through the utilization of existing ZMI diagnostic EMG technology.  ZND has not generated revenue for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and we are no longer actively pursuing sales of this product line.
 
Zynex Billing and Consulting (ZBC):
 
During the latter part of 2012, we established a medical billing and consulting subsidiary, ZBC. ZBC provided outsourced billing services for private medical practices, which include collection services, medical coding and general billing consulting. ZBC is majority owned by Zynex, Inc. (80%) and has a non-controlling interest member, owning 20%. We ceased providing billing and consulting services in April of 2015. ZBC produced 0.0% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Product Uses
 
Pain Management and Control
 
Standard electrotherapy is a clinically proven and medically accepted alternative to manage acute and chronic pain. Electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce most types of local pain, such as tennis elbow, neck or lower back pain, arthritis, and others. The devices used to accomplish this are commonly described as the TENS family of devices. Electrotherapy is not known to have any negative side effects, a significant advantage over most pain relief medications. The benefits of electrotherapy can include: pain relief, increased blood flow, reduced edema, prevention of venous thrombosis, increased range-of-motion, prevention of muscle disuse atrophy, and reduced urinary incontinence.
 
Electrotherapy introduces an electrical current applied through surface electrodes. The electrical current “distorts” a pain signal on its way to the central nervous system and the brain, thus reducing the pain. Additionally, by applying higher levels of electricity, muscles contract and such contraction may assist in the effects mentioned above.
 
Numerous clinical studies have been published over several decades showing the effectiveness of IFC and TENS for pain relief. Zynex’s primary TENS device, the NexWave has received FDA 510(k) clearance. The NexWave is a digital IFC, TENS and NMES device that delivers pain-alleviating electrotherapy.
 
Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation
 
Our proprietary NeuroMove product is a Class II medical device that has been cleared by the FDA for stroke and SCI rehabilitation. Stroke and SCI usually affect a survivor’s mobility, functionality, speech, and memory, and the NeuroMove helps the survivor regain movement and functionality.
 
The NeuroMove product utilizes the relatively new science of “neuroplasticity”, the process by which healthy parts of the brain learn to compensate and assume functions previously carried out by the damaged areas. To accomplish this task, the extraordinarily sensitive NeuroMove technology monitors muscle activity and detects brain signals that indicate, even without any visible movement, the brain’s effort to move a specific muscle or area of the body. Once the effort is detected, the NeuroMove induces actual movement through electrical stimulation, thus providing effective feedback to initiate relearning in the healthy part of the brain.
 
We believe the NeuroMove product is unique because its built-in microprocessor can recognize low-level attempts by muscles to contract and then “reward” such detection with electrical stimulation. We do not believe there are similar products in the stroke rehabilitation market. Some generic devices are being offered in international markets; however, we do not believe these products provide similar results with respect to stroke rehabilitation. When conscientiously using the NeuroMove product for three to twelve months, studies show that the majority of NeuroMove patients can re-establish the connection between the brain and impaired muscle and thus regain movement and functionality.  When movement and functionality are restored, the patient may experience increased mobility, increased productivity, an improved outlook, and a reduced risk of accidents, and may be able to engage in activities they were precluded from before using the NeuroMove. Sales of NeuroMove have not generated material revenue for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Our Markets
 
Zynex Medical (ZMI):
 
To date, the majority of our revenue has been generated by our ZMI electrotherapy products. Thus, we primarily compete in the home electrotherapy market, with products based on IFC, TENS and NMES devices and consumable supplies. We estimate the annual domestic market for home electrotherapy products at approximately $500 million. Due to our improved recent financial performance and related cash flows, we are currently growing our sales force to address what we believe is an unaddressed market in the electrotherapy market. The current opioid epidemic has been declared a health emergency and we are uniquely positioned to help reduce the amount of opioids prescribed for treatment of chronic and acute pain symptoms. We are committed to providing health care professionals with alternatives to traditional opioid based treatment programs with our prescription-strength products which have no side-effects. This has never been more necessary than it is today considering the staggering statistics.

· | Pain impacts the lives of more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pain is the leading cause of disability and the most common reason American’s seek health care is because they are seeking treatment for acute or chronic pain.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 1 in every 4 Americans (76.2 million people), suffer with pain that lasts longer than 24 hours.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approximately 25.3 million adults struggle with chronic pain, pain every day that has been present for more than 3 months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If pharmaceuticals such as opioids continue to be used as the first line of defense America will continue to see a rise in opioid misuse, addiction and drug-related deaths.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have added new products such as JetStream Hot/Cold Therapy, Aspen LSO Backbracing and Comfortrac cervical traction, all products targeted at treating acute as well as chronic pain without side-effects.
 
In the market segments in which we compete, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. The primary competitor in our market is International Rehabilitative Sciences, Inc. d/b/a RS Medical. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.

Key characteristics of our electrotherapy market are:
 

● | Collection cycles of initial payment from insurance carriers can range from 30 days to many months and considerably longer for many attorney, personal injury and worker’s compensation cases. Such delayed payment impacts our cash flow and can slow our growth or strain our liquidity. Collections are also impacted by whether effective billing submissions are made by our billing and collections department to the insurance carriers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prior to payment, the third party payors often make or take significant payment “adjustments or discounts.” This can also lead to denials and billing disputes with third party payors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale of medical devices and from recurring patient supplies, specifically from our electrotherapy products sold through ZMI. We are reliant on insurance reimbursement.

Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):
 
ZMS is focused on developing products within the non-invasive multi-parameter patient-monitoring marketplace. ZMS is currently focusing on developing its blood volume monitor. We believe our product, once released into the marketplace (of which there can be no guarantee), will compete against multiple competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited range of products. We have not yet identified competitors for this product. ZMS has not generated any revenue as this product is still in the process of FDA approval and CE Marking.
 
Zynex NeuroDiagnostics (ZND):
 
ZND is focused on developing products within the neurosensing marketplace in an effort to diversify our concentration of ZMI electrotherapy revenue. There were no significant revenues during 2017 or 2016 in ZND.
 
Sales and Growth Strategies
 
To date, ZMI accounts for substantially all of our revenue and profit. We are currently focused on expanding our sales force to address what we believe is an untapped market for electrotherapy products which has recently become more attractive due to large competitors exiting the market.
 
In an effort to increase revenue and diversification to become less sensitive to reimbursement changes, we are continually adding new products such as our hot/cold therapy, cervical traction and LSO back braces which are less impacted by insurance reimbursement to our ZMI sales channel and are pursuing other opportunities, including the Blood Volume Monitor. We believe these events and actions will serve to focus and increase our market share in the electrotherapy market and, in the future, diversify our product mix. We also continue to modify and refine our geographic sales channels through experienced sales representatives, representing a mix of Zynex employees, sales contractors and international distributors. As of December 31, 2017 we had approximately101 active field sales representatives. An insignificant amount of our revenue is derived from international sales; however we continue to take steps to penetrate the global medical device marketplace.
 
Manufacturing and Product Assembly
 
Our manufacturing and product assembly strategy consists of the following elements:
 

● | Compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Use of contract manufacturers as much as possible, thereby allowing us to quickly respond to changes in volume and avoid large capital investments for assembly and manufacturing equipment. Domestically and internationally, there is a large pool of highly qualified contract manufacturers for the type of devices we manufacture.
● | Utilization of in-house final assembly and test capabilities. 
● | Development of proprietary software and hardware for all products in house. 
● | Testing all units in a real-life, in-house environment to help ensure the highest possible quality and patient safety while reducing the cost of warranty repairs.

We utilize contract manufacturers (principally located in the United States) to manufacture components for our NexWave and NeuroMove units and for some of our other products; and manufacture / assemble in-house for our NexWave and NeuroMove units. We do not have long term supply agreements with our contract manufacturers, but utilize purchase orders with agreed upon terms for our ongoing needs. We believe there are numerous suppliers that can manufacture our products and provide our required raw materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of our required raw materials and components. We are always evaluating our suppliers for price, quality, delivery time and service. The reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations.
 
During 2016 and the first half of 2017, our inventory levels, which is driven by product assembly, was constrained by liquidity issues. Due to improved operating results in 2016 and 2017, we believe our liquidity constraints have been removed and we are in the process of building our inventory reserves to meet current sales demands. 
 
Distribution and Revenue Streams:
 
Currently, almost all of our revenue is generated through our ZMI subsidiary from our electrotherapy products.
 
We sell most of our medical devices through direct and independent sales representatives in the United States. Our field sales representatives are engaged to sell in predefined geographic markets and are compensated based on the amount of cash collected from products sold. Currently, the United States has been the market that we have focused on; however, we have established international distributors in Canada, Australia, Russia, China, India, Singapore, Holland, Germany, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Viet Nam. Typically, we sell and ship product directly to our international distributors, who work directly with the ultimate patient or end-user. To date these international customers have not generated significant revenue.
 
A significant portion of our revenue is derived from patients with private health insurance carriers with insurance plans, typically known as HMO or PPO, on behalf of their insureds as well as worker’s compensation agencies. The balance of the revenue is primarily received from attorneys representing injured patients, hospitals, clinics and private-pay individuals. We no longer accept Medicare and Medicaid orders.
 
A large part of our revenue is recurring. Recurring revenue results primarily from the sale of surface electrodes and batteries sent to existing patients on our units. Electrodes and batteries are consumable items that are considered an integral part of our products.
 
Private Labeled Distributed Products
 
In addition to our own products, we distribute, through our sales force, a number of private labeled products from other domestic manufacturers in order to complement our products. These products generally include patient consumables, such as electrodes and batteries plus cervical traction, lumbar support and hot/cold therapy. Customarily, there are no formal contracts between vendors in the durable medical equipment industry. Replacement products and components are easily found, either from our own products or other manufacturers, and purchases are made by purchase order.

Intellectual Property
 
Although we do not own any patents, we believe that our products contain certain proprietary software. We currently have applied for utility patents for products related to cardiac monitoring within ZMS in both US and Europe. In the future, we may seek patents for advances to our existing products and for new products as they are developed. During 2017 and 2016, we incurred approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. We expect our research and development expenditures will be limited throughout 2018.
 
Zynex is trademarked in the U.S.
 
We utilize non-disclosure and trade secret agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary information.
 
Regulatory Approval and Process
 
Federal Drug Association (FDA)
 
All our ZMI products are classified as Class II (Medium Risk) devices by the FDA, and clinical studies with our products are considered to be NSR (Non-Significant Risk Studies). Our business is regulated by the FDA, and all products typically require 510(k) market clearance before they can be put in commercial distribution. Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, is available in certain instances for Class II (Medium Risk) products. It requires that before introducing most Class II devices into interstate commerce, our introducing the product must first submit information to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to March 1976 or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that do not require approval of a premarket approval application. When the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent, the agency issues a “clearance” letter that authorizes marketing of the product. We are also regulated by the FDA’s GMP and QSR (Quality Systems Regulation). We believe that our products have obtained or are good candidates for the requisite FDA clearance or are exempt from the FDA clearance process. In November 2001, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market NeuroMove. In September 2011, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the NexWave, our current generation IFC, TENS and NMES device. In August 2012, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the InWave, our next generation muscle stimulator for treatment of female incontinence. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could adversely affect us.
International
 
Zynex has received CE Marking approval for several of its products. CE Marking is a certification that a product meets the standards established by the 28 nations of the EU and qualifies for sale in the EU and 4-nation European Free Trade Association.
 
The Far East, Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin American markets have different regulatory requirements. We comply with applicable regulatory requirements within the markets in which we currently sell. If and when we decide to enter additional geographic areas, we intend to comply with applicable regulatory requirements within those markets.
 
Zynex has received ISO13485: 2012 certification for its compliance with international standards in quality management systems for design, development, manufacturing and distribution of medical devices. This certification is not only important as an assurance that we have the appropriate quality systems in place but is also crucial to our international expansion efforts as many countries require this certification as part of their regulatory approval. The quality management system is audited on an annual basis and current recertification is pending final audit review.

Government Regulation
 
The delivery of health care services and products has become one of the most highly regulated of professional and business endeavors in the United States. Both the federal government and individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of health care services and products. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Each program is financed, at least in part, with federal funds. State jurisdiction is based upon the state’s interest in regulating the quality of health care in the state, regardless of the source of payment. Many state and local jurisdictions impose additional legal and regulatory requirements on our business including various states and local licenses, taxes, limitations regarding insurance claim submission and limitations on relationships with referral parties. Failure to comply with this myriad of regulations in a particular jurisdiction may subject us to fines or other penalties, including the inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.
 
Federal health care laws apply to us when we submit a claim to any other federally funded health care program, in addition to requirements to meet government standards. The principal federal laws that we must abide by in these situations include:
 

● | Those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs.

 
The federal government may impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on anyone who files a false claim for reimbursement from federally funded programs.
 
A federal law commonly known as the “anti-kickback law” prohibits the knowing or willful solicitation, receipt, offer or payment of any remuneration made in return for:
 

● | The referral of patients covered under federally-funded health care programs; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any goods, facility, items or service reimbursable under those programs.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 109 employees. We also engage a number of independent commission-only sales contractors.
