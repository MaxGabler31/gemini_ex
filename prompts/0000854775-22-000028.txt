ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Background and Product Offerings
Digi International Inc. ("Digi®," "we," "our," or "us") was incorporated in 1985 as a Minnesota corporation. We were reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol DGII. Our World Headquarters is located at 9350 Excelsior Blvd., Suite 700, Hopkins, Minnesota 55343. The telephone number at our World Headquarters is (952) 912-3444. 
We are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical Internet of Things ("IoT") connectivity products, services and solutions. We help our customers deploy, monitor and manage critical communications infrastructures that deliver important information in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. We have two reportable operating segments under applicable accounting standards: (i) IoT Products & Services; and (ii) IoT Solutions. 
Our IoT Products & Services segment offers products and services that help original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), enterprise and government customers create and deploy, secure IoT connectivity solutions.

Ongoing Impacts of Global Macro-Economic Conditions
The impacts of global macro-economic conditions, driven largely by the war in Ukraine and the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have disrupted supply chains for a range of goods and services, continue to create significant uncertainty regarding the nearer term outlook for our operations and the markets into which we sell. 
To date these conditions have primarily impacted our supply chain in adverse ways that include container ship backlogs, energy shortages in certain parts of the world, and components and material shortages. This has led to shortfalls in available components we need to make products as well as increased costs both to obtain components and to transport components and products. It has also lengthened the timelines for us to fulfill customer orders, increasing our backlog, and in some cases has led to an inability to meet an increasing level of demand for our products. The severity of the disruptions is changing continuously, meaning the impact on our ability to meet demand for particular products in a timely manner has been subject to ebb and flow. In some instances, these disruptions have been material and it is possible more material disruptions will occur. We are taking steps to attempt to mitigate the impact of the disruptions such as placing inventory demand further out into the future to secure our allocations of components, negotiating and engaging with suppliers to reserve components, encouraging customers to place orders earlier than normal due to longer lead times and attempting (in conjunction with customers) to influence political leaders to assure components needed to make products that are essential to the health and well-being of society are prioritized to our customer’s needs by suppliers. At present the ongoing duration and severity of these disruptions is not known. As such, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these disruptions on our business and financial results, which could be material.
We also continuously monitor customer demand for the products and services we sell and have not seen material decreases in demand.
Industry and Marketplace Conditions
We believe the IoT industry is in the midst of a multi-year expansion as many industries are undergoing a digital transformation within their business that drives demand for IoT capabilities across a broad spectrum of services. Among others, IoT use cases include condition-based monitoring of perishable goods, enabling remote work by employees, automating workflows and operations and providing and maintaining secure connectivity and monitoring of operating assets.
Our IoT Products & Services segment represented the majority of our sales in fiscal 2022. This segment sells both wired and wireless products that are either embedded into the products of OEMs or as stand-alone products. These offerings allow our customers to connect a wide range of assets to networks. This segment grew during fiscal 2022, led by increases in our cellular and console server revenues. The segment includes some products that are in the mature phase of their life cycle and have been experiencing sales declines for several years. We manage this segment with more focus on profitability and more modest revenue growth expectations relative to our IoT Solutions segment. Recently we have begun to place more emphasis on the delivery of subscription-based solutions offerings for many of these products.
Our IoT Solutions segment grew significantly in fiscal 2022 primarily because of our acquisition of Ventus in our first fiscal quarter. The segment is comprised primarily of our SmartSense and Ventus offerings. SmartSense provides condition-based monitoring services for perishable goods such as food and medicines for health-care, pharmaceutical and food industry. Ventus provides MNaaS offerings to manage and maintain network connectivity for assets such as ATMs and lottery kiosks. The offerings in this segment are offered on a subscription model and provide us with a stable base of recurring higher-margin revenues.
While our business performed well in fiscal 2022 and we expect an ongoing long-term trend of marketplace growth, each of our business segments is susceptible to downturns either because of general macro-economic conditions, the continued development of technology that can make products less competitive or even obsolete and uncertainty or changes in regulatory environments. Given the current uncertainty in macro-economic conditions, including, but not limited to, potential recessionary conditions, ongoing supply chain disruptions globally and the uncertain status of large project-based customer deployment opportunities, our results during fiscal 2023 may be inconsistent.
Strategy
We remain focused on taking steps that we believe will deliver consistent, long-term growth with higher levels of profitability. This includes continuously reviewing and managing the product and solution offerings we provide to align with customer interests and meet market demand. In addition, acquisitions have helped significantly advance our offerings and driven growth and profitability, in both business segments. Over time we expect to continue to be active in making further acquisitions. 
IoT Products & Services Segment
Our IoT Products & Services segment is being managed so our product management and sales personnel are aligned along specific product lines to bring greater market focus and potential growth to the product lines. We also continue to drive efforts to pair our hardware offerings with our Digi Remote Manager® device management platform as well as other support services. These bundled offerings allow customers to monitor and manage the performance of our hardware remotely. This segment generated over $14 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) as of September 30, 2022. Please see "Key Business Metrics" section in Part II, Item 7 for additional details on how ARR is measured.
IoT Solutions Segment
Our IoT Solutions segment is driven by recurring traditionally high margin subscription-based revenues. Following our acquisition of Ventus in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the segment now represents approximately 25% of total revenues. This segment generated $80 million in ARR as of September 30, 2022. We have high organic growth expectations and we will continue to explore added scale through acquisitions.
SmartSense by Digi helps customers monitor temperature and other conditions important to preserve the quality of perishable or other sensitive inventories and tracks the completion of employee tasks. Our efforts have created a market-leading, high-growth hardware enabled service business with a significant recurring revenue base. At present, this marketplace primarily is served by smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to provide hardware-enabled implementation services to customers in as effective and efficient a manner as we are able to do because of our long-standing history as an IoT hardware provider. 
SmartSense by Digi presently serves many leading brands in the following vertical markets: food service, healthcare (primarily pharmacies) and supply chain. These markets share similar needs for continuous monitoring and asset tracking for compliance and regulatory purposes and we believe they comprise a large addressable market with low customer penetration. 
In November 2021, we acquired Ventus Holdings. Ventus is a leader MNaaS solutions that simplify the complexity of enterprise WAN connectivity for an array of applications in banking, healthcare, retail, gaming, hospitality and other sectors. 
Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisitions
In addition to our fiscal 2022 acquisition of Ventus disclosed above, we have made the following acquisitions from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2021.
In December 2019, we acquired New Jersey-based Opengear, Inc. ("Opengear®"), a provider of secure IT infrastructure products and software. This acquisition provides products that are complementary to our IoT Products & Services segment.
In March 2021, we acquired Haxiot, Inc. ("Haxiot®"), a provider of low power wide area ("LPWA") wireless technology. This acquisition enhanced our IoT Products & Services segment by enhancing Digi's embedded systems portfolio and immediately extending the company's market reach with a complete LoRaWAN-based solutions offering.
In July 2021, we acquired Ctek, Inc. ("Ctek"), a provider that specializes in solutions for remote monitoring and industrial controls. Through the acquisition of Ctek, Digi is uniquely positioned to provide customers with both battery and hardwired options for the control and monitoring of critical infrastructure, furthering Digi’s reach in a rapidly expanding market.
Sales Channels
A significant portion of our IoT Products & Services segment sales are made through a global network of distributors, systems integrators and value added resellers ("VARs"). These third parties accounted for 50.0%, 47.0% and 37.5% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our IoT Solutions segment historically has not sold through these channels. We also complete sales of both IoT Products & Services and IoT Solutions through our own dedicated sales organization directly to a wide range of end user customers. This dedicated sales team accounted for 50.0%, 53.0% and 62.5% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Distributors
Our larger distributors, by sales volume, include Arrow Electronics, Avnet, Bressner Technology GmbH, Digi-Key, Express Systems & Peripherals, Ingram Micro, Mouser Electronics, Solid State Supplies, Symmetry Electronics, Synnex, Tech Data, Tokyo Electron Device and Venco Electrónica S.A. We also maintain relationships with many other distributors both domestically and internationally.
Strategic Sales Relationships 
We maintain alliances with other industry leaders to develop and market technology solutions. These include many major communications hardware and software vendors, operating system suppliers, computer hardware manufacturers, enterprise application providers and cellular carriers. Among others, relationships include: AT&T, NXP, Orange, Rogers, Silicon Laboratories, T-Mobile, Telus, Telit, Verizon, Vodafone and several other cellular carriers worldwide. 
We have established relationships with equipment vendors in a range of industries such as energy, industrial, retail, transportation, medical, and government that allow these partners to ship our products and services as component parts of their overall solutions. Our products are used by many of the world’s leading telecommunications companies and Internet service providers, including, among others, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.
No single customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for any of the fiscal years 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Competition
We compete primarily in the communications technology industry. This industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. This market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. It is possible new market entrants could market and sell disruptive technologies that impact one or more of our product or service offerings. In addition, we may compete with other companies to acquire new businesses or technologies and the competition to secure such assets may be intense. We compete for customers on the basis of 
existing and planned product features, service and software application capabilities, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, alliance relationships, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price and availability. While no competitor offers a comparable range of products and services, various companies do compete with us with respect to one or more of our products or solutions. With respect to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who dedicate more resources and attention to that particular offering than we are able to do given the breadth of our business. As the marketplace for IoT connectivity products and solutions continues to grow, we expect to encounter increased competition. Some of these competitors may have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess.
Manufacturing Operations
We outsource our manufacturing operations to certain contract manufacturers, which are located primarily in Thailand, Mexico, Taiwan and China. We rely on third party foundries or companies who rely on third party foundries for our semiconductor devices that are Application Specific Integrated Circuits ("ASICs"). We also outsource printed circuit board production. By outsourcing our operations to these manufacturers, we can leverage the manufacturing strength of our vendors, which allows us to focus on new product introductions. In addition, it allows us to reduce our fixed costs, maintain production flexibility and optimize our profits. 
Our products are manufactured to our designs with standard and custom components. Most of the components are available from multiple vendors. We have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. As disclosed elsewhere, our manufacturing operations, like those of other companies, are dependent on relationships with these suppliers who are also experiencing supply chain disruptions. If these suppliers are unable to provide a timely and reliable supply of components, we could experience manufacturing delays that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a material way. In an effort to mitigate supply chain exposure, we have increased our amount of inventory on hand.
In addition, as a result of the global pandemic, there has been increased attention focused on actions of the Chinese government with respect to how they attempt to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. Also, as a result of the war in Ukraine, governments around the world have imposed sanctions on Russia and Belarus. These situations could lead to potential adverse impacts on a wide range of businesses and could disrupt the supply of components or end-products that we produce.
In general, our business is not considered to be highly seasonal, although our first fiscal quarter revenue is often less than other quarters due to holidays and fewer business days. 
Research & Development and Intellectual Property Rights
Due to rapidly changing technology in the communications technology industry, we believe a large part of our success depends upon the product and service development skills of our personnel as well as our ability to integrate any acquired technologies with organically developed technologies. While we dedicate significant resources to research and development, many of our competitors are focused on a smaller set of products than us and are likely able to dedicate more resources than us toward the portions of the market in which we compete with them. In recent periods, as a result of supply chain constraints, a significant portion of our research & development spending has been focused on the re-design or reconfiguration of existing products using different components. This has lowered our ability to focus on new product development.
Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks.
We have established common law and registered trademark rights on a family of marks for a number of our products. Our IoT Products & Services primarily are sold under the Digi, Rabbit®, Digi XBee, and Opengear brands. We believe that the Digi and Rabbit brands have established strong identities with our targeted customer base and our customers associate the Digi brand with "reliability" and the Rabbit brand with "ease of integration." We believe that our customers associate Digi XBee with "ease of use." Many of our customers choose us because they are building a very complex system solution and they want the highest level in product reliability and ease of integration and use. Our IoT Solutions are offered under the Ventus and SmartSense by Digi brands.
Our patents are applicable to specific technologies and are valid for varying periods of time based on the date of patent application or patent grant in the U.S. and the legal term of patents in the various foreign countries where patent protection is obtained. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company and products.
