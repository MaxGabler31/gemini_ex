ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Introduction
 
As used in this report, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, the "Company" and terms such as "we," "us" "our," and "AIRI" refer to Air Industries Group, a Nevada corporation, and its directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
We are an aerospace and defense company. We manufacture and design structural parts and assemblies that focus on flight safety, including landing gear, arresting gear, engine mounts, flight controls, throttle quadrants, jet engines and other components. We also provide sheet metal fabrication of aerostructures, tube bending and welding services. Our products are currently deployed on a wide range of high profile military and commercial aircraft including Sikorsky’s UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Northrop Grumman’s E2 Hawkeye, Boeing’s 777, Airbus’ 380 commercial airliners and the US Navy F-18 and USAF F-16 fighter aircraft. Our Turbine Engine sector makes components for jet engines that are used on the USAF F-15, the Airbus A-330 and A-380, and the Boeing 777, in addition to a number of ground turbine applications.
 
We became a public company in 2005 when our net sales were approximately $30 million. At that time we had been manufacturing components and subassemblies for the defense and commercial aerospace industry for over 45 years and had established long term relationships with leading defense and aerospace manufacturers. We have capabilities and expertise in metal fabrication, welding and tube bending; the production of electromechanical systems, harness and cable assemblies; the fabrication of electronic equipment and printed circuit boards; the machining of turbine engine components; and the assembly of packages or “kits” containing supplies for all branches of the United States Defense Department, including ordnance parts, hose assemblies, hydraulic, mechanical and electrical assemblies.
 
As of December 31, 2017, our three operating segments consisted of:
 
Complex Machining: comprised of Air Industries Machining (“AIM”) and Nassau Tool Works (“NTW”). Since the lease for the premises occupied by NTW expires in October 2018, we are relocating and consolidating the operations of NTW into the facilities of AIM in Bay Shore, New York, approximately six miles from the premises presently occupied by NTW on Long Island.
Aerostructures & Electronics: comprised of Welding Metallurgy (“WMI”), Eur-Pac, Electronic Connections (“ECC”) and Compac Development (“Compac”). We previously relocated the operations of Miller Stuart, and Compac from their locations on Long Island to Welding Metallurgy’s facility in Hauppauge, Long Island NY, and merged Woodbine Products and Miller Stuart into WMI.
 
On March 21, 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI”) for the sale of Welding Metallurgy and related assets of our Aerostructures & Electronics segment, for a purchase price of $9,000,000, subject to a working capital adjustment. The SPA also provides for contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 if WMI enters into specified agreements by May 31, 2018 and July 31, 2018, respectively (the “Specified Dates”), which contingent payments are subject to reduction by $100,000 for each calendar month after the Specified Dates which passes before WMI enters into the specified agreements. The sale is subject to certain conditions, including CPI obtaining financing for the amount of the purchase price, and requires an escrow deposit of $2,000,000 to cover the working capital adjustment and our obligation to indemnify CPI against damages arising out of the breach of our representations and warranties and obligations under the SPA. It is anticipated that the sale will close in May or June of 2018.
 
Turbine Engine Components: comprised of The Sterling Engineering Corporation and, until its sale in January 2017, included AMK Welding.
 
Given the pending sale of WMI and our repositioning to achieve profitability and growth, in the future we may reallocate our business into different operating and reporting segments.

Our Market
 
We operate primarily in the military and, to a lesser degree, commercial aviation industries. Defense revenues represent a preponderance of our sales. Our principal customers include Sikorsky Aircraft, Goodrich Landing Gear Systems, Northrop Grumman, the United States Department of Defense, GKN Aerospace, Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, Piper Aircraft, M7 Aerospace, Vought Aerospace, Ametek/Hughes-Treitler and Airbus.
 
Our products are incorporated into many aircraft platforms, the majority of which remain in production, and of which there are a substantial number of operating aircraft in the fleets maintained by the military and commercial airlines. We believe that we are the largest supplier of flight critical parts to Sikorsky’s Black Hawk helicopter. We have made, or currently make, or have been awarded, products for the CH-47 Chinook helicopter, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Northrop Grumman’s E2 Hawkeye, Boeing’s 777, Airbus’ 380 commercial airliners, and the US Navy F-18 and USAF F-16 fighter aircraft. Our Turbine Engine Components segment makes components for jet engines that are used on the USAF F-15, the Airbus A-330 and A-380, and the Boeing 777, in addition to a number of non-military ground turbine applications.
 
Many of our products are “flight critical,” essential to aircraft performance and safety on takeoff, during flight and when landing. These products require advanced certifications as a condition to being a supplier. For many of our products we are the sole or one of a limited number of sources of supply. Many of the parts we supply are subject to wear and tear or fatigue and are routinely replaced on aircraft on a time of service or flight cycle basis. Replacement demand for these products will continue, albeit at perhaps a lower rate, so long as an aircraft remains in service, which is usually many years after production has stopped.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our approach to sales and marketing can be best understood through the concept of customer alignment. The aerospace industry is dominated by a small number of large prime contractors and equipment manufacturers. These customers rely heavily upon subcontractors to supply quality parts meeting specifications on a timely and cost effective basis. These customers and other customers we supply routinely rate their suppliers based on a variety of performance factors. One of our principal goals is to be highly rated and thus relied upon by all of our customers.
 
The large prime contractors are increasingly seeking subcontractors who can supply and are qualified to integrate the fabrication of larger, more complex and more complete subassemblies. We seek to position ourselves within the supply chain of these contractors and manufacturers to be selected for subcontracted projects. Successful positioning requires that we qualify to be a preferred supplier by achieving and maintaining independent third party quality approval certifications, specific customer quality system approvals and top supplier ratings through strong performance on existing contracts. We believe that the various capabilities we have acquired through our acquisition program increase the likelihood we will qualify for and be awarded larger, more complex projects.
 
During our sales and marketing efforts we let customers know that we have employees with the talent and experience to manage the manufacture of sections of aircraft structures to be delivered to the final assembly phase of the aircraft manufacturing cycle, and customers have now engaged us for these services.
 
Initial contracts are usually obtained through competitive bidding against other qualified subcontractors, while follow-on contracts are usually retained by successfully performing initial contracts. The long term business of each of our current operating segments generally benefits from barriers to entry resulting from investments, certifications, familiarization with the needs and systems of customers, and manufacturing techniques developed during the initial manufacturing phase. We endeavor to develop each of our relationships to one of a “partnership” where we participate in the resolution of pre-production design and build issues, and initial contracts are obtained as single source awards and follow-on pricing is determined through negotiations.

Our Backlog
 
Within our Complex Machining and Turbine Engine Components segments, the production cycle of products can extend from several months to a year or longer. This gives rise to significant backlogs as customers must order product with sufficient lead time to ensure timely delivery.
 
We have a number of long-term multi-year General Purchase Agreements or GPA’s with several of our customers. These agreements specify part numbers, specifications and prices of the covered products for a specified period, but do not authorize immediate production and shipment. Shipments are authorized periodically by the customer to fit their production schedule. We recently received a renewal of our multi-year contract with Sikorsky, MY9, for the years 2018 to 2023. This contract is for $47 million worth of product during this period. This is the third multi-year contract award we have received from Sikorsky.
 
Our “firm backlog” includes only fully authorized orders received for products to be delivered within the forward 18-month period. As of February 28, 2018, our 18-month “firm funded backlog” was approximately $106 million.
 
Competition
 
Winning a new contract is highly competitive. For the most part we manufacture to customer design specifications, and we compete against companies that have similar manufacturing capabilities in a global marketplace. Consequently, the ability to obtain contracts requires providing quality products at competitive prices. To accomplish this requires that we strive for continuous improvement in our capabilities to assure our competitiveness and provide value to our customers. Our marketing strategy involves developing long-term ongoing working relationships with customers. These relationships enable us to develop entry barriers to would-be competitors by establishing and maintaining advanced quality approvals, certifications and tooling investments that are difficult and expensive to duplicate. Many of our competitors are well-established subcontractors engaged in the supply of aircraft parts and components to prime military contractors and commercial aviation manufacturers. Among our competitors are: Monitor Aerospace, a division of Stellex Aerospace; Hydromil, a division of Triumph Aerospace Group; Heroux Aerospace and Ellanef Manufacturing, a division of Magellan Corporation.
 
Many of our competitors are larger enterprises or divisions of significantly larger companies having greater financial, physical and technical resources, and the capabilities to timelier respond under much larger contracts.
 
Raw Materials and Replacement Parts
 
The manufacturing process for certain products, particularly those for which we serve as product integrator, requires significant purchases of raw materials, hardware and subcontracted details. As a result, much of our success in profitably meeting customer demand for these products requires efficient and effective subcontract management. Price and availability of many raw materials utilized in the aerospace industry are subject to volatile global markets and political conditions. Most suppliers of raw materials are unwilling to commit to long-term contracts at fixed prices. This is a substantial risk as our strategy often involves long term fixed price commitments to our customers. Recently, we have had difficulties in securing timely shipments of raw materials from certain vendors due to our liquidity problems. Once the sale of WMI is closed, we are optimistic that our supply chain difficulties will alleviate.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018 we employed approximately 275 people. Of these, approximately 45 were in administration, 20 were in sales and procurement, and 211 were in manufacturing. We estimate that if the sale of WMI is completed, we will employ approximately 208 people, 25 in administration, 18 in sales and procurement and 165 in manufacturing.
 
Air Industries Machining, one of the components of our Complex Machining segment, is a party to a collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”) with the United Service Workers, IUJAT, Local 355 (the “Union”) with which we believe we maintain good relations. The Agreement, dated January 1, 2016, expires December 31, 2018 and covers all of AIM’s production personnel, of which there are approximately 104 people. AIM is required to make a monthly contribution to each of the Union’s United Welfare Fund and the United Services Worker’s Security Fund. This is the only pension benefit required by the Agreement and the Company is not obligated for any future defined benefit to retirees. The Agreement contains a “no-strike” clause, whereby, during the term of the Agreement, the Union will not strike and AIM will not lockout its employees.

All of our employees are covered under a co-employment agreement with Extensis, Inc., a professional employer organization that provides out-sourced human resource services.
 
Regulations 
 
Environmental Regulation; Employee Safety
 
We are subject to regulations administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, various state agencies and county and local authorities acting in cooperation with federal and state authorities. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions that require us to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous chemicals and substances. The extensive regulatory framework imposes compliance burdens and financial and operating risks on us. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil and criminal fines in the case of violations.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on the present and former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. New York and Connecticut, the states where all of our production facilities are located, also have stringent laws and regulations governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, counterparts of CERCLA and RCRA. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which requires employers to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, obligates employers to provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances.
 
Federal Aviation Administration
 
We are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have never been subject to such fines or disqualifications.
Government Contract Compliance
 
Our government contracts and those of many of our customers are subject to the procurement rules and regulations of the United States government, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Many of the contract terms are dictated by these rules and regulations. During and after the fulfillment of a government contract, we may be audited in respect of the direct and allocated indirect costs attributed to the project. These audits may result in adjustments to our contract costs. Additionally, we may be subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations because of our participation in government procurement. Any inquiry or investigation can result in fines or limitations on our ability to continue to bid for government contracts and fulfill existing contracts.
 
We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits required for the operation of our business.
