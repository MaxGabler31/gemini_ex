ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Our Business
 
The Company is currently engaged in identifying and assessing new business opportunities.
 
On November 11, 2014, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation (“CURE”), a California company engaged in the development of oral thin film (“OTF”) for the delivery of nutraceutical, over-the-counter and prescription products. Initially this alliance was comprised of an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra) Products throughout Asia, Brazil, the Middle East and Canada acquired at a cost of $200,000 while a joint venture agreement for the procurement of converting and packaging equipment specific for oral thin film products was proposed through a Letter of Intent. In addition, Altair and Cure agreed to enter into further joint ventures or other business relationships for the purpose of completing the development and marketing of additional products, and for license and distribution agreements for additional Cure products such as aspirin, sleep-aid, topical muscle and joint pain relief, and electrolytes delivered through OTF or other methods. Altair advanced $360,000 to CURE in this regard.
 
On September 23, 2016, the Company and CURE agreed to terminate the Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil Products due to unanticipated costs of obtaining regulatory approvals for the introduction of these pharmaceutical products into the licensed markets. The Company and CURE agreed to replace it with an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for a family of sports related nutraceutical products including a topical active for joint and muscle pain and OTF products for delivery of electrolyte, energy, sleep and recovery actives. The Company was to become the exclusive worldwide distributor for these products. The fee for this new sport products agreement was $560,000, comprised of the $200,000 fee paid for the Sildenafil agreement and the $360,000 advanced as a deposit for future license and distribution agreements. The agreement called for minimum orders of the products by Altair of $1,500,000 in the twenty-four months from the date of signing. As of June 29, 2018, the Company has been unable to generate any sales of the products due to a lack of working capital and the human resources required to introduce the products to market. The Company anticipates that it will not meet the minimum order requirements for the initial 24 month period and accordingly wrote off its $560,000 investment in the agreement in these financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017.
 
The Company had previously planned to commence operations in the architectural field and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas. This plan was abandoned in the 2015 fiscal year in favor of the business operations described above.
