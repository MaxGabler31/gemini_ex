 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging our novel targeted oncology platform to develop a potential new standard of care across multiple cancer indications, with an initial focus on ocular and urologic oncology. Our proprietary platform enables the targeting of a broad range of solid tumors using Virus-Like Particles, or VLPs, that can be conjugated with drugs or loaded with nucleic acids to create Virus-Like Drug Conjugates, or VDCs. Our VDCs are largely agnostic to tumor type and can recognize a surface marker, known as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, or HSPGs, that are specifically modified and broadly expressed on many tumors. AU-011, our first VDC candidate, is being developed for the first line treatment of primary choroidal melanoma, a rare disease with no drugs approved. We have completed a Phase 1b/2 trial using intravitreal administration that has demonstrated a statistically significant growth rate reduction in patients with prior active growth and high levels of tumor control with visual acuity preservation in a majority of patients, as assessed using clinical endpoints in alignment with the feedback from U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. These data supported advancement into a Phase 2 dose escalation trial, where we are currently evaluating suprachoroidal, or SC, administration of AU-011. We plan to present six to twelve month safety and efficacy data from this trial in 2022 and, take a decision on the route of administration to, initiate a pivotal trial in the second half of 2022. We are also developing AU-011 for additional ocular oncology indications and plan to file an IND in the United States in the second half of 2022 for choroidal metastases. Leveraging our VDCs’ broad tumor targeting capabilities, we also plan to initiate a Phase 1a trial in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC, our first non-ophthalmic solid tumor indication, in the second half of 2022 and present Phase 1a data from this trial in 2023.
VDCs are a novel class of drugs with a dual mechanism of action that promotes cancer cell death by both the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to generate acute necrosis and by activating a secondary immune mediated response. VDCs are analogous to ADCs, another technology that employs a targeting moiety and a cytotoxic payload. In contrast to the limited tumor specificity of individual ADCs, the tumor targeting specificity of VDCs is driven by the selective binding of the VLPs to modified HSPGs expressed on the tumor cell membrane. This targeting mechanism enables the delivery of multiple types of cytotoxic payloads directly to a wide range of solid tumors.


   
Figure 1. Structure of our VDCs and HSPG Targeted Tumor Binding. The cytotoxic drug payload is covalently bound to the VLP to form the VDC. The capsid proteins that make up the VLP can recognize HSPGs modified by tumor cells and function analogously to the antibody of an ADC.
 We believe that our VDC platform has the potential to serve as a backbone for a broad portfolio of targeted oncology therapeutics and has the following potential key advantages:
1.A single VDC can deliver hundreds of cytotoxic molecules conjugated to its capsid proteins. 
 2.Based on the ability of VLPs to selectively recognize specifically modified and overexpressed HSPGs present on a large number of tumor types, VDCs have the potential to be used broadly across a wide range of cancers with limited off-target toxicity. 
 3.The VDCs have a high number of HSPG binding sites and this multi-valency permits the strong and selective binding to tumor cells. 
 4.VDCs have a dual mechanism of action, first by acute necrosis of the tumor cells, and subsequently by creating a highly immunogenic milieu that induces an antitumor specific immune response potentially leading to a more robust and durable therapy. 
 Our goal is to leverage our platform to develop a new class of targeted therapies that bring therapeutic benefit to multiple cancer indications, initially focusing on the field of ocular oncology, a field representing a potential $1.5 billion market opportunity. Our next area of focus, bladder cancer, is one of the most expensive cancers to treat on a per patient basis, and the global market for bladder cancer is expected to reach $4.0 billion by 2028 across the United States, EU5 and Japan. To date, we have produced a VDC, AU-011, that we are advancing in multiple indications, as shown in the pipeline below.
   
We are initially developing AU-011 for the treatment of primary choroidal melanoma, a vision- and life-threatening ocular cancer for which there are currently no drugs approved. Choroidal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer in adults, with an incidence of 11,000 patients/year in the United States and Europe. It is estimated that 96% of patients are diagnosed early without clinical evidence of metastatic disease. However, despite the current treatments with radiotherapy the long-term prognosis is poor with death occurring in more than 50% of cases and irreversible vision loss within 5 to 10 years in approximately 70% of cases. We intend to develop AU-011 as a first line therapy to treat early-stage disease which includes small melanomas and indeterminate lesions representing approximately 9,000 patients/year in the United States and Europe. AU-011 has also been granted Orphan Drug designation for treatment of uveal melanoma by the EMA.
AU-011 consists of an HPV-derived VLP conjugated to hundreds of infrared laser-activated molecules. The VDC is designed in a way that prevents the conjugation from interfering with tumor binding enabling its selectivity to specifically modified HSPGs on tumor cells but not to normal cells. Laser activation of AU-011 is designed to result in precise tumor cell killing with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. In the absence of AU-011 activation or binding to the tumor cell membrane, there is no cytotoxic effect. Multiple laser treatments, following a single dose of AU-011, increase antitumor activity because of the reoxygenation of the tumor and the photostability of AU-011. Finally, acute necrosis triggers immunogenic cell death leading to the generation of an adaptive, long-term antitumor immune response.
   In our completed Phase 1b/2 trial, AU-011, administered by intravitreal injection, was well-tolerated and demonstrated high levels of local tumor control while preserving vision at twelve months in patients that had prior active tumor growth. The therapeutic regimen of AU-011 achieved tumor shrinkage or a near-zero growth rate in the majority of patients and was associated with preservation of visual acuity in 71% of patients at twelve months. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 dose escalation trial of AU-011 with SC administration. We intend to initiate the first pivotal trial in the second half of 2022. Because our mechanism of action preserves key ocular structures, we also intend to develop AU-011 for additional ocular oncology indications, beginning with choroidal metastases.
In addition, we are developing AU-011 for the treatment of NMIBC. Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system and is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. While metastatic bladder cancer has several approved therapies, there are very limited options for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. We are planning to initiate clinical development of AU-011 with intramural administration, a novel route of administration, for the treatment of patients with intermediate high-risk NMIBC. This novel route of administration is intended to place high levels of the drug at the base of the tumor where laser activation of AU-011 can cause necrosis and prevent residual tumor cells from further growth and recurrence. We have generated preclinical in vivo data that supports that our dual mechanism of action can lead to cytotoxicity and long-term antitumor immunity which may further reduce the risk of metastases. We believe this immune response can play an even larger role in bladder cancer, given that bladder cancer has a well-documented response to immune activation. We are conducting IND-enabling studies with AU-011 and intend to begin clinical trials in the second half of 2022 and present Phase 1a data from this trial in 2023.

Prior to founding VelosBio Inc. he was the Chief Executive Officer at Acerta Pharma B.V. leading to its acquisition by AstraZeneca plc for $7 billion.
   Our Strategy
Our goal is to leverage our proprietary platform to develop a new class of targeted therapies that deliver meaningful therapeutic benefit to a range of cancer indications with high unmet need in which we believe we can establish a new standard of care. The key elements of our strategy include:

▪Advance AU-011 through late-stage clinical development and, if approved, commercialization for the first line treatment of primary choroidal melanoma. In our Phase 1b/2 trial for AU-011 using intravitreal administration, we observed in patients that had prior active tumor growth high levels of local tumor control while preserving vision at twelve months. We are currently evaluating SC administration of AU-011 in a Phase 2 trial in patients with choroidal melanoma and we plan to present the six to 12 month safety and efficacy data from this trial in 2022 at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. We believe SC administration will increase tumor exposure to the drug while reducing exposure in the vitreous. We expect to take a decision on the route of administration and decide on either the IVT or SC route of administration to initiate a pivotal trial by the end of 2022. We have received orphan drug designation for treatment of uveal melanoma and fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of choroidal melanoma and have aligned with FDA, EMA and the UK MHRA on the design and endpoints of this trial. If approved, this would represent the first therapy for primary choroidal melanoma as a first line treatment option for early-stage disease, reserving radiotherapy for a second line treatment option. If approved, we intend to independently commercialize AU-011 in ocular cancers using a limited sales force to target the approximately 50 ocular oncologists in the United States and approximately 50 ocular oncologists in Europe, who are a focused call point that treat most patients. 
 ▪Continue developing AU-011 for additional ocular oncology indications, starting with choroidal metastases. We intend to be at the forefront of ocular oncology innovation and believe we can apply our mechanism of action for AU-011, which has the potential to treat tumors while preserving key ocular structures, to multiple other ocular oncology indications. Beyond small primary choroidal melanoma and indeterminate lesions, we intend to develop AU-011 in multiple other ocular oncology indications, starting with choroidal metastases. We plan to file an IND with the FDA in the second half of 2022 for choroidal metastases. In addition, we plan to develop AU-011 for tumors of the ocular surface, including both melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Every year, approximately 4,500 patients are diagnosed with cancers of the ocular surface. We plan to leverage the sales force infrastructure we intend to build for primary choroidal melanoma for these additional ocular oncology indications. 
 ▪Pursue development of AU-011 for our first non-ophthalmic solid tumor indication in NMIBC. Our novel approach has the potential benefit of treating early-stage solid tumors, particularly NMIBC, while generating long-term antitumor immunity to prevent metastasis. We believe that local administration into the bladder, and the ability to use a focused laser to activate AU-011, provides the opportunity to apply our technology platform to this area of high unmet medical need. Bladder cancer represents an attractive indication given its sensitivity to immune response, high unmet medical need and expense in treating. AU-011’s pro-immunogenic mechanism of action has shown robust activity in preclinical models as a single agent and synergy with checkpoint inhibitors in this indication. Our preclinical data supports initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial, which we expect to begin in the second half of 2022, subject to FDA acceptance of our IND, with plans to present Phase 1 data from this trial in 2023. 
 ▪Broaden the application of our proprietary technology platform to expand our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the expression of specifically modified HSPGs across a wide range of solid tumors, we plan to evaluate our technology platform in other oncology indications. We also plan to expand the use of our proprietary technology platform by continuing to explore the potential to deliver other therapeutic agents, including nucleic acid therapies and non-light activated molecules, to broadly treat solid tumors. 
 ▪Evaluate and selectively enter into strategic collaborations to maximize the potential of our pipeline and accelerate the development of our programs. While we continue to retain worldwide rights to AU-011, we may opportunistically evaluate and enter into strategic collaborations around AU-011 or future product candidates, geographies, or disease areas. We believe our technology platform has the potential to enable the development of a broad scope of product candidates that reaches beyond AU-011. By selectively entering into collaborations, we believe our potential to expand and accelerate the development of our programs and maximize worldwide commercial potential may be enhanced. 

   Targeting a broad range of solid tumors with our proprietary technology platform
Our technology platform represents a novel approach of targeting a broad range of solid tumors using VLPs that can be loaded or conjugated with drugs creating a new class of targeted therapies. Our VDCs are analogous to ADCs, another technology that employs a targeting moiety and a payload. ADCs typically utilize a monoclonal antibody to traffic a cytotoxic payload preferentially to tumor cells. There are currently 11 FDA-approved ADCs, six of which have gained regulatory approval since 2019. The class achieved approximately $4 billion in sales in 2020 and is expected to garner over $27 billion in sales in 2026.
Despite the successful adoption of this modality, there remains room for improvement. Key challenges related to ADCs include the limited number of payloads that can be conjugated onto the ADC along with toxicities that have been reported. Only two to five toxin drug conjugate molecules per antibody can be delivered, potentially reducing potency, which can necessitate higher doses of toxic drug to be delivered. These higher doses and the expression of ADC target receptors on healthy tissue can lead to systemic toxicity. We believe our VDCs can expand upon the foundation built by ADCs, given VDCs are endowed with specific attributes designed to overcome the shortcomings of ADCs.
The key finding that launched our technology development efforts was the observation that human papilloma virus, or HPV, binds to specifically modified HSPGs on the tumor cell membrane. HSPGs are a large family of molecules found in the extracellular matrix and on the membranes of cells. Tumors cells specifically modify HSPGs with key sulfation modifications that provide high binding specificity to a number of ligands. Tumor modified HSPGs regulate many aspects of tumor progression, including proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastases. Our scientific founder, John Schiller, PhD, and his colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, identified that these specific modifications enable HSPG-selective binding of HPV on tumor cells, as illustrated below.
   
Figure 2. VDCs bind to specifically modified HSPGs on the tumor cell surface with multivalent binding and do not bind to normal healthy cells.

   This NIH team discovered that HSPG-selective binding of HPV was determined by the properties of the proteins that make up the viral capsid, or shell, not by the nucleic acids contained within the shell. Dr. Schiller pioneered the development of VLPs into a highly effective HPV vaccine to prevent cancer, work for which he received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award. He discovered that these capsid proteins could be recombinantly manufactured and could self-assemble into empty VLPs without any viral genome. Our technology platform is based on HPV derived VLPs that were further engineered to reduce cross-reactivity with pre-existing immunity against HPV, enabling the use of VLPs as oncology therapeutics. This platform leverages the tumor-specific targeting mechanism of HPV VLPs to enable their use to deliver cytotoxic payloads directly to a wide range of solid tumors. VLPs have also demonstrated the ability to deliver nucleic acids, potentially expanding our platform on which to base a novel class of oncology therapies.
We believe that our technology platform has the potential to serve as a backbone for a broad portfolio of therapeutics. There are four key potential advantages of VDCs compared to ADCs:
1.A single VDC can deliver hundreds of cytotoxic molecules conjugated to its capsid proteins. 
 2.The VDCs have a high number of HSPG binding sites and, it is this multi-valency that permits the strong binding of the VDCs with tumor cells. 
 3.Based on the ability of VLPs to selectively recognize specifically modified and overexpressed HSPGs present on a large number of tumor types, VDCs have the potential to be used broadly across a wide range of cancers with limited off-target toxicity. 
 4.Tumor treatment with VDCs results in a dual mechanism of action, both directly with acute necrosis of the tumor cells, and indirectly by creating a highly immunogenic milieu inducing an antitumor specific immune response leading to a more robust and durable therapy. 
 Choroidal melanoma overview
Choroidal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer in adults, with an incidence of 11,000 patients/year in the United States and Europe. This comprises approximately 90% of all cases of uveal melanoma, consisting of melanomas in the choroid, ciliary body and iris, which are collectively referred to as the uvea. It is estimated that 96% of patients are diagnosed early without clinical evidence of metastatic disease. There are approximately 2,000 new cases treated each year in the United States and 1,600 new cases treated each year in Europe. However, despite the current treatments with radiotherapy, the long-term prognosis is poor with death occurring in more than 50% cases and irreversible vision loss within 5 to 10 years in approximately 70% of cases. We intend to develop AU-011 as a first line therapy to treat early-stage disease which includes small melanomas and indeterminate lesions representing approximately 9,000 patients in the United States and Europe. Most cases are found in adults with a median age of 55, light eye color and fair skin. It is often discovered in patients who are asymptomatic, although some patients report decreased vision or non-specific visual symptoms such as flashes, floaters, blurry or distorted vision or visual field defects. Most choroidal melanomas result from transformation of a benign choroidal nevus. In early stage lesions, most of the tumor is composed of benign nevi cells with a small cluster of malignant melanoma cells. Benign choroidal nevi are found in approximately 5% of adults in the United States 40 years or older. There are 3,900 patients every year in the United States that are diagnosed with indeterminate melanocytic lesions that have risk factors and that are referred to the ocular oncologist.
Our goal is to develop AU-011 as a first line treatment option that can enable early treatment intervention of primary choroidal melanoma while preserving vision and reserving radiotherapy for a second line treatment option. Earlier diagnosis and early treatment intervention of lesions in the eye before the onset of metastatic disease may dramatically change outcomes for patients.
   Current treatment options for choroidal melanoma
There are no FDA-approved therapies for choroidal melanoma. There are three primary treatments that are routinely used for local control of choroidal melanoma: plaque brachytherapy; proton beam irradiation; and enucleation, or removal of the affected eye, each of which represent invasive surgical procedures.
   
Figure 3. Three primary treatments for choroidal melanoma.
 The limited options available to treat patients with choroidal melanoma pose challenges to clinicians and patients. The existing treatments are far from innocuous: all of them are invasive procedures that are associated with irreversible loss of visual acuity and other deleterious side effects. Because choroidal melanoma tends to metastasize early, even with radical treatments such as enucleation, metastatic disease still occurs, which results in a high degree of mortality. We believe that there is an urgent unmet medical need for an effective vision preserving therapy and that the availability of such a therapy may encourage treatment of early stage ocular lesions and increase the awareness of the importance of early diagnosis for this life-threatening disease.
Our solution AU-011
AU-011 is a VDC consisting of an HPV-derived VLP and IRDye 700DX, a laser activated cytotoxic payload. Our VLP was created using the capsid proteins of HPV that have been genetically modified to avoid cross-reactivity with pre-existing immunity against the virus and bind with high affinity to specifically modified HSPGs found on the surface of tumors cells, including ocular melanoma cells.
   
Figure 4. AU-011, administered by intraocular injection, binds to tumor cells. Activation using an ophthalmic laser leads to rupture of the tumor cell membrane, acute necrosis and a secondary immune activation leading to long term antitumor immunity.

   Goal of Treatment with AU-011
In ocular oncology, the goal of early stage local treatment is to achieve tumor control—to prevent the tumor from growing further while preserving the delicate ocular structures such as the retina. We believe that treatment early in the disease course can also limit the risk of metastasis for patients. After treatment, if tumors do not have an increase in thickness by ultrasound or an increase in diameter as evaluated with digital photography, it is believed that the malignant cells have been killed, tumor control has been achieved and the treatment is considered successful. Ocular oncologists measure the antitumor activity after plaque brachytherapy by evaluating tumor control as well as systemic disease to detect the presence of metastasis.
   
Figure 5. Goal of treatment with AU-011 is local tumor control with targeted killing of melanoma cells.
 We believe that patients with earlier stage tumors stand to derive the most benefit from AU-011. These tumors are not only the most likely to respond to our therapy but, based on historic data, these patients also have the highest likelihood of not having already developed life-threatening metastatic disease, and as such, AU-011 has the potential to confer the greatest long-term benefit.
Phase 1b/2 demonstrated robust antitumor activity
A total of 56 patients out of 57 patients enrolled with a clinical diagnosis of choroidal melanoma were treated with AU-011, due to one patient not having met predefined active growth criteria. Tumor growth measurements were obtained by one centralized reading center.
The tumor control rate at twelve months across all treatment doses and initial tumor sizes was 54% based on the predefined criteria of tumor control failure as an increase in thickness of greater than 0.5 mm or an increase in diameter of more than 1.0 mm.
The key two subgroups were patients with well-documented active growth (n=20) and those with well-documented active growth treated at the highest therapeutic regimen (n=14). The 20 patients with well-documented active growth treated at all doses had a tumor control rate of 60%. The 14 patients with well-documented active growth treated at the highest therapeutic regimen had a tumor control rate of 64%.
   When compared to each patient’s rate of tumor growth within the prior two years before enrollment, the growth rate after treatment with AU-011 at any dose demonstrated a statistically significant reduction both when assessing all patients with active growth as well as patients on the maximum therapeutic regimen.
Phase 1b/2 demonstrated preservation of visual acuity
We believe that showing preservation of visual acuity will be critical in our application for regulatory approval of AU-011 to show that it can both halt tumor growth and preserve visual acuity. Visual acuity was measured at regular intervals as a key efficacy endpoint. In the Phase 1b/2 trial we defined the loss of visual acuity as the loss of three lines of vision, or 15 letters, using best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, which the FDA considers a clinically meaningful vision loss. We found moderate loss of visual acuity immediately following treatment, which we believe was associated with short-term reversible adverse events such as ocular inflammation and corneal abrasions. Upon resolution of the short-term adverse events, visual acuity recovered in the majority of patients, and we observed a vision preservation rate of 86% across all 56 treated patients in the trial over the twelve months follow up period and 71% for the 14 patients enrolled with active growth and treated with two cycles of AU-011 therapy.
Only four out of 14 patients with small tumors with active growth had a long-term loss of more than 15 letters of vision that did not recover back to less than the 15 letters at 12 months. These were related to persistent adverse events, such as pigmentary changes, macular edema or subretinal fluid. Of the four patients that had persistent vision loss, two lost greater than 30 letters and the other two had a loss of 17 and 18 letters which is close to the threshold of 15 letters.
Importantly, 17 of the 20 patients with small tumors with active growth had tumors close to the fovea or optic nerve and were considered high risk for severe vision loss with radiotherapy. In this patient population, the vision preservation rate was 76% (13/17 patients) highlighting a potential important benefit AU-011 may have over the current standard of care.
Phase 1b/2 safety and tolerability data
Treatment with AU-011 was generally reported to be well-tolerated at all doses including when two cycles of therapy were administered. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate, transient and manageable with standard of care treatments in most patients. Expected AEs of vitreous inflammation, anterior chamber inflammation and increased intraocular pressure were manageable with steroid treatment and ocular antihypertensives.
Intraocular inflammation represented the most common treatment related AE, which was expected given the viral-like component of our drug and the pro-immunogenic mechanism of action. These inflammatory events included anterior chamber inflammation in approximately 71% of patients and posterior inflammation in 91% of patients. Posterior inflammation originated in and around the tumor, suggesting that this inflammation may, at least in part, be related to potential antitumor activity of AU-011. This inflammation was not prophylactically treated, which allowed the immune response to initiate before starting steroid therapy. Cases of anterior inflammation were treated with topical steroid drops, while posterior inflammation was treated with topical, oral, intravitreal or periocular steroids. Approximately 46% of patients also had transient increases in intraocular pressure that were managed with topical anti-hypertensives. One patient had a Grade III vitreous opacity that was removed with surgery.
Adverse events of pigmentary changes around the tumor margin were reported in approximately 38% of patients and were the cause of the only two drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, of vision loss. In these two subjects the edge of the tumor was within 1.0 mm of the fovea and the pigmentary changes occurred in the fovea causing the vision loss of greater than 30 letters. Two SAEs that were not related to treatment were reported in two patients, one event each of papillary renal cell carcinoma and diverticulitis.
   A high proportion of patients (43/56; 77%) in the trial were at high risk for vision loss with radiotherapy because their tumors were close to the fovea or optic disk (<3.0 mm). If these patients had been treated with radiotherapy, historical studies suggest that a large proportion would have a worse visual acuity prognosis, with many having vision of <20/200 or legal blindness within five years. Approximately 90 percent of high-risk patients with tumors near the fovea or optic nerve had a significant vision loss with plaque brachytherapy as the plaque led to irreversible damage to the fovea or optic nerve. In contrast, most of the high-risk patients in our trial were successfully treated with AU-011 without a significant impact on their visual acuity, highlighting the potential benefit relative to the current standard of care.
We believe that AU-011 has the potential to deliver meaningful clinical benefit to patients with early-stage choroidal melanoma as a first-line treatment while decreasing the likelihood of irreversible loss of visual acuity and other severe comorbidities that are often associated with radiotherapy.
Suprachoroidal delivery
As part of our overall development strategy, we are evaluating and developing the SC route of administration to optimize the delivery of AU-011 to the choroid where the tumor is located. The suprachoroidal space, or SCS, is a potential space bound between the external surface of the choroid and the internal surface of the sclera and encompasses the full circumference of the full posterior segment of the eye.
   
Figure 6. Suprachoroidal administration with SCS MicroinjectorTM.
 Our preclinical data supports the SCS as an attractive site for intraocular drug delivery for choroidal melanoma as it provides an optimization of the therapeutic index due to increased bioavailability at the tumor and lower exposure to key ocular structures.
Phase 2 suprachoroidal administration trial
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 dose escalation trial of AU-011 with SC administration in 22 patients with choroidal melanoma. The primary objective of this portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and treatment regimen. We believe SC administration can result in a better target product profile with reduced inflammation because of significantly lower exposure of the drug to the vitreous and potentially higher clinical activity than intravitreal administration because of increased drug exposure to the tumor in the choroid.
   The results from the initial patient cohorts with an average of six months follow-up demonstrated that SC administration was generally well tolerated with no serious treatment related adverse events reported. To date, drug and laser related adverse events have included four patients with mild anterior uveitis, two patients each with both punctate keratitis and eye pain, and one patient each with conjunctiva hyperemia, conjunctival edema, cystoid macular edema, eyelid edema, pupils unequal retinal pigment epitheliopathy, salivary gland enlargement and vision blurred. One moderate adverse event of anterior scleritis related to the injection procedure was also observed. All of the events resolved spontaneously or with standard of care treatment. Of note, no inflammation in the vitreous has been observed in this trial through the two cycles of the highest tested dose (40 µg). Given the tolerability profile with the 40 µg dose, we increased the highest dose to 80 µg per treatment and plan to explore a new treatment regimen with three cycles of treatment. Currently 2 cycles of 80 µg have been confirmed to be safe and the third cycle of treatment is underway. We plan to present the six to 12 month safety and efficacy data from this trial in the second half of 2022.
   
Figure 7. Adverse events among the 13 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 suprachoroidal trial to date.
 Pivotal trial plan in choroidal melanoma
In alignment with the FDA and EMA, we plan on conducting two pivotal trials with AU-011. We anticipate to start the first pivotal trial in the second half of 2022 in patients with high-risk indeterminate lesions and small choroidal melanoma who have active growth prior to enrollment. We intend to randomize a minimum of 70 patients in this trial to three arms 2:1:2 to receive therapeutic regimen AU-011, low dose regimen AU-011 or a sham control. Patients will be selected based on having a small amount of active growth within two years of trial enrollment, and a tumor size of 0.5 mm to 3.0 mm in thickness and less than 10 mm in diameter.
Pivotal Trial
   
Figure 8. Preliminary design of the pivotal trial.

   The key primary endpoint agreed with the FDA is contemplated to be the tumor thickness growth rate over 12 months, comparing the growth rates between the AU-011 high dose group and the sham group. The first key secondary endpoint will be a composite time to event analysis that will evaluate the number of events of disease progression or visual acuity failure between the AU-011 high dose group and the sham group. We will also evaluate time to disease progression and change from baseline in BCVA letter score. There will be a minimum follow up for all patients of 12 months.
The trial has a power of >95% to meet the primary and the first key secondary endpoint. Since there is no drug approved for the treatment of choroidal melanoma, we have agreed with FDA that a statistically significant difference on these endpoints will provide support from a regulatory perspective to meet the requirement of clinical effectiveness.
Given that choroidal melanoma is a rare disease and, based on the limited natural history data of the growth rate of these early-stage tumors, this trial will follow an adaptive design with the ability to perform a sample size re-estimation. With this adaptive design, the sample size will be increased if either (1) the observed growth rate in the sham arm is lower than assumed or (2) the estimated treatment effect comparing the sham arm and the high dose arm is less than expected. With this strategy, we believe we will improve the probability of success of the trial.
We also plan to conduct a second pivotal trial, which will be a Phase 3 randomized trial, that is expected to start enrolling when the first pivotal trial completes enrollment. This Phase 3 trial is planned to be an identical design to the Phase 2b pivotal trial described above with the same primary and secondary endpoints. The final sample size of this second pivotal trial will be determined by the final sample size of the Phase 2b pivotal trial.
If warranted by the data, we plan to submit the results of the first pivotal trial to support approval of AU-011 for the treatment of primary indeterminate lesions and small choroidal melanoma. Based on the results of the first pivotal trial, if positive, and the fact that there are no therapies approved for the treatment of this rare disease, the FDA and EMA may agree to grant approval based on the first pivotal trial with the condition that the second Phase 3 pivotal trial should be completed as a post-approval commitment. However, the FDA and/or EMA may require both trials for approval, which will be addressed subsequent to submission of the data from the first pivotal trial.
Registry Trial
We have agreement with the FDA that we will monitor all patients for a total of five years after dosing to evaluate the long-term tumor response, visual acuity preservation and safety, as well as the risk of metastatic disease and mortality, which we are doing in a Phase 4 registry trial. To date, all 57 patients in the Phase 1b/2 trial with intravitreal administration have completed the Phase 1b/2 trial and 41 (72%) have entered the registry trial. There are also 7 patients from the Ph2a portion of the SC trial that have entered the registry trial. The data collected with an average follow up of more than two years from initial enrollment in the Phase 1b/2 trial or the Phase 2 SC trial and follow up in the registry demonstrates durability of tumor control, visual acuity preservation and related safety profile from treatment of AU-011. All subjects in the registry trial treated only with AU-011 had stable vision and only 2 local progressions of disease after more than two years of average follow-up. For those patients who progressed in tumor size in the Phase 1b/2 trial and who received standard of care with radiotherapy, two patients lost visual acuity and one additional patient had to have their eye enucleated because of tumor recurrence after radiotherapy, reaffirming our belief that there is a high unmet medical need in this patient population.
Only one of 40 patients in the registry had onset of metastatic disease which is an encouraging result as usually the metastatic risk for small melanomas is approximately 12% up to 10 years’ follow up.
Matched case control studies
The ability to demonstrate tumor control with long term visual acuity preservation could provide a favorable benefit-risk profile of AU-011 for the first line treatment of patients with early-stage choroidal melanoma compared to an invasive radiotherapy procedure. To demonstrate the long-term value of visual acuity preservation for patients treated with AU-011, we are conducting two Matched Case Control, or MCC, studies that will provide data comparing AU-011 to radiotherapy. A retrospective MCC study has been performed to provide an estimate of the vision benefit of AU-011 versus radiotherapy and to help estimate the treatment effect and powering of the prospective MCC study that was initiated in 2021. These studies are discussed below.
   Retrospective matched case control study analysis
To estimate the vision preservation of AU-011 compared to radiotherapy we are conducting a retrospective MCC analysis comparing the group of patients in our Phase 1b/2 trial who had tumors at high risk for vision loss due to its location close to the fovea or optic disk and were treated with AU-011 (n=43) to patients with tumors of similar size and location previously treated with radiotherapy at the Wills Eye Hospital Ocular Oncology Service led by Dr. Carol Shields. This analysis will match up to 5:1 patients using the key baseline characteristics that impact long term visual acuity – tumor location, tumor size and baseline visual acuity – and will compare the visual acuity after treatment with each therapy in terms of a change from baseline in vision and absolute vision at years one, two and three. Results from our Phase 1b/2 trial with intravitreal administration show visual acuity preservation in a majority of patients after two cycles of treatment with AU-011 at twelve months. In addition, data from our ongoing registry trial to date do not show a change or decline in vision for patients treated with AU-011 with long term follow up, while two patients that failed treatment with AU-011 and were treated with radiotherapy are having vision loss. We believe that the results of the retrospective study will further validate these results and strengthen our thesis that the mechanism of AU-011 enables durable preservation of visual acuity providing an important advantage to radiotherapy. The results of the retrospective study are expected to be published with Dr. Carol Shields in the first half of 2022 and will be used to estimate the assumptions to power a prospective Matched Case Control study that we plan to start shortly thereafter.
Prospective matched case control study
Based on the results of the retrospective MCC analysis we are initiating a prospective matched case control trial where we will compare, after one, two, and three years, the visual acuity of patients treated with AU-011 versus patients treated with radiotherapy. Like the retrospective MCC analysis, patients will be matched based on similar tumor size, location, and baseline vision at the beginning of the trial.
   
Figure 9. Matched case control prospective trial comparing visual acuity outcomes after treatment with AU-011 or plaque radiotherapy.
 The patients are planned to be matched on average 3:1 (Radiotherapy: AU-011) to increase the power. The matching and analysis will be masked and performed independently. The objective is to show the vision benefit of AU-011 compared to radiotherapy using prospective data for both groups. Based on initial results in the retrospective MCC study, we believe these results may support the benefit/risk discussion of our regulatory submission and to serve as support for pricing and reimbursement discussions.
   Choroidal metastases from other tumors
We can apply our mechanism of action for AU-011, which we believe has the ability to preserve key ocular structures, in multiple other ocular oncology indications. Beyond primary choroidal melanoma, we are developing AU-011 in additional ocular oncology indications, starting with choroidal metastases. Choroidal metastases are a common intraocular malignancy that are caused by multiple primary cancers in the body that metastasize to the eye due to the high blood flow and perfusion that provides an environment receptive to metastases and tumor growth. Approximately 22,000 patients have choroidal metastases globally every year. and approximately half (~47%) of the patients with choroidal metastases have primary breast tumors. Other common primary cancers include lung (approximately 21%), gastrointestinal (4%), kidney (2%), cutaneous melanoma (2%) and prostate cancer (2%), and approximately 17% of cases with an unknown primary tumor type. The majority of these malignancies are solitary small tumors in the choroid associated with subretinal fluid and, as opposed to choroidal melanoma, they can occur in and adversely affect vision in both eyes. These lesions are typically treated with radiation, which has the same comorbidities as previously described for the treatment of choroidal melanoma. Given their poor prognosis, the quality of life and, in particular, maintenance of vision, for patients with metastatic cancer is critical and as such there is a significant unmet need for an effective vision sparing ocular treatment that enables patients to avoid additional surgical interventions.
We are planning to initiate clinical development in this indication in the second half of 2022, subject to FDA acceptance of an IND.
AU-011 for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
We are developing AU-011 for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC. We are planning to initiate clinical development with AU-011 with intramural administration, a novel route of administration for the treatment of patients with intermediate and high-risk bladder cancer lesions. This novel route of administration is based on the direct administration of AU-011 into the lamina propria of the bladder wall at the tumor edge. It is intended to place high levels of AU-011 at the base of the tumor where laser activation can cause localized necrosis preventing residual tumor cells from further growth and recurrence. We are conducting IND-enabling studies with AU-011 to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and intend to begin clinical trials in the second half of 2022.
Bladder cancer disease background
Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system and is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. Estimates are that there will be 61,300 new cases of bladder cancer and 17,000 deaths in 2021 in the United States. Globally, bladder cancer accounts for approximately 570,000 cases, with 422,000 cases comprised of NMIBC, and 165,000 deaths each year. Patients with bladder cancer classically present with painless blood in the urine, however, because this symptom is like those of benign disorders such as urinary tract infections, cystitis, prostatitis and the passage of kidney stones, the diagnosis of bladder cancer is often delayed while these other, more common, conditions are ruled out. Furthermore, symptoms are often intermittent. Delays in diagnosis can lead to a worsened prognosis due to the presence of more advanced stage disease by the time a confirmation of bladder cancer is made.
   Our solution AU-011
We are currently developing AU-011 for the treatment of NMIBC with IND-enabling studies and plan to initiate a Phase 1a trial in the second half of 2022, subject to FDA acceptance of an IND, to evaluate the feasibility of intramural administration and to assess distribution, safety and initial proof of mechanism with evaluation of local acute cellular necrosis after laser activation. We believe AU-011 represents a potential targeted therapy that can be activated using a similar laser as that currently utilized in our choroidal melanoma program, following a well-characterized approach with commercially available devices used by urologists.
AU-011 has been observed to be highly selective, through both its specific binding to modified HSPGs on cancer cells, combined with focused laser activation leading to cytotoxicity and subsequent immune activation. We believe the immune response could play an even larger role in bladder cancer, given that bladder cancer has a well-documented response to immune activation. This immune sensitivity is substantiated by the effectiveness of immune modulatory agents like BCG. We have observed in preclinical experiments that AU-011 was able to target bladder cancer cells in both in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Laser activation of AU-011 resulted in cell killing of bladder tumor cells while sparing other normal surrounding cells as a single agent. This cell killing induced a pro-immunogenic antitumor response that resulted in complete elimination of tumors in a mouse xenograft model and durable responses as well as the prevention of tumor re-implantation. This highlights the value of AU-011 to generate antitumor immunity and prevent tumor recurrence. Based on our preclinical data, AU-011 was also observed to be highly synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors that have already been approved for the treatment of a subset of NMIBC and metastatic bladder cancer patients.
   
Figure 10. Overview of AU-011’s dual mechanism of action with acute tumor cell necrosis and secondary antitumor immunity.
 Clinical plans in NMIBC
We intend to conduct a Phase 1 trial in intermediate and high risk NMIBC patients that are either candidates for TURBT or cystectomy beginning in the second half of 2022, subject to FDA acceptance of our IND. We plan to evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of AU-011 using the intramural route of administration. After removal of the tumors, we plan to further assess the tumor tissue with histopathology to evaluate the presence of acute cellular necrosis as an early sign of antitumor response.
      
Figure 11. Phase 1 window of opportunity trial to establish route of administration and tumor necrosis.
 In this Phase 1 trial, we intend to evaluate the tumor distribution of AU-011 after intramural administration in intermediate to high-risk subjects with NMIBC. In cohort 1, we will assess AU-011 local and systemic exposure without laser activation. In cohorts 2 and 3 we will assess AU-011 and laser activation in patients with intermediate risk that are planned to receive TURBT and high risk patients that are unresponsive to BCG and that are planned to receive cystectomy. In these cohorts, we plan to administer AU-011 followed by laser activation, and one week later the tumor will be removed by TURBT (cohort 2) or the entire bladder by cystectomy (cohort 3), and we will assess tumor response in the form of necrosis and the immune response by pathology and immunohistochemistry. This Phase 1a trial is planned to be conducted in association with the National Cancer Institute at approximately three selected private sites in the United States and is planned to be initiated in the second half of 2022.
Shortly after this initial trial, we are planning to conduct a Phase 1b/2 dose escalation and expansion trial in the treatment of NMIBC. We believe this Phase 1b/2 trial will help establish the treatment regimen and we are planning to involve multiple leading sites in the treatment of bladder cancer.
Other HSPG-Expressing Tumors
Our HPV-derived VLPs have a unique tropism towards cancer cells based on their multivalent binding to modified HSPGs that are specifically found in tumor cells. In vitro, we have observed our VLPs bind to multiple cancer cell lines. In vivo, we have also observed binding using our HPV-derived VLPs using xenografts of human tumor cell lines and allografts of murine tumor cell lines, like lung, ovarian, bladder, melanoma and colon. These results help to corroborate the thesis that multiple tumors appear to consistently express and specifically modify HSPGs. Accordingly, we believe we may be able treat a broad spectrum of solid tumors. We plan to select our next solid tumor indication for clinical development with AU-011 based on its status as a tumor type with high HSPG expression, such as cutaneous melanoma and head and neck cancer.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid innovation of new technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that AU-011 and our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
   We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and companies focusing on developing therapies in the oncology field. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue oncology therapeutics. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize AU-011 and any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
Ocular oncology
Currently we are not aware of any other company that has a drug in clinical development for the treatment of primary choroidal melanoma or for the treatment of choroidal metastases, which are our first two planned ocular oncology indications. The standard of care as a first line treatment for patients is plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy. Verteporfin (Visudyne) is currently used off label in some cases of early stage disease alone or in combination with transpupillary thermotherapy. It is possible that there may be other companies with compounds in pre-clinical development but we are not aware of any data that has been published or presented at any conference. Given our stage of development, we believe we are the furthest along in development. Our focus in ocular oncology is the treatment of the primary cancer in the eye before it metastasizes. Immunocore Holdings PLC, or Immunocore, recently received FSA approval for KIMTRAK® (tebentafusp-tebn) injection for metastatic uveal melanoma. Immunocore’s drug is indicated for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma and has not been developed to treat the early stage disease in the eye.
 Urologic oncology
There are multiple companies that have drugs in clinical development for the treatment of intermediate and high risk NMIBC patients that are unresponsive to BCG. ImmunityBio, Inc. has presented Phase 2/3 data for their drug Anktiva in combination with BCG in patients with BCG unresponsive high grade NMIBC and they plan to submit a BLA in 2022. Sesen Bio, Inc. presented Phase 3 data for their lead candidate, Viceneum, as a treatment for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, but in August 2021 the FDA sent Sesen Bio, Inc. a Complete Response Letter, indicating that the agency would not approve the application. The agency recommended additional clinical and statistical data analyses, and had concerns related to the company's Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC). FerGene, Inc. announced positive data of their pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3), an investigational gene therapy, for the treatment of high-grade, BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, however, they have announced delays due to chemistry, manufacturing and controls problems, so it is uncertain when they marketing application will be submitted (last update on BLA filing was May 2020). UroGen Pharma Ltd. has a drug Jelmyto, a gel reformulation of mytomicin that is currently approved to treat low grade upper tract urothelial cancer, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of NMIBC. CG Oncology, Inc. has a drug (CG0070) that is being investigated in a global Phase 3 clinical trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.

Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidate. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
   In the United States, where we initially focused our product development, the FDA regulates biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidate, AU-011, has not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
The process required by the FDA before any product candidates we develop are approved for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 ▪approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 ▪preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal trials, accompanied by payment of FDA user fees; 
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 ▪satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency; 
 ▪potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 ▪FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States. 
 Preclinical and clinical trials for biologics
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and it must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the protocol(s) for the initial clinical study and the general investigational plan. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial. A separate protocol submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted in the United States, each of which may begin following a 30 day period unless the FDA issues a clinical hold on the clinical trial.
   The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol to be conducted in the United States, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as an amendment to the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted, or by a central IRB, to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
While we plan to conduct any international clinical trials under our INDs, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States under its IND may need to obtain waivers for certain regulatory compliance requirements such as those requiring IRB review and approval. However, the FDA does not require that all foreign clinical trials be conducted under United States INDs. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which phases may overlap or be conducted in combination.
▪Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 ▪Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 ▪Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
   Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
Expanded Access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of intended clinical development to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes for the following expanded access requests: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. There is no requirement for a company to provide expanded access to its investigational product.
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our product candidates. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a biologics license application, or BLA. A BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
   The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA may refer an application for a biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation, for example, as to whether the biologic is sufficiently safe and efficacious in a given indication for a given population and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making marketing approval decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition for approving the BLA to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
   Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Expedited development and review programs for biologics
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and Accelerated Approval.
A new biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including priority review and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
A product intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive Accelerated Approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
   Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or biologic approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the confirmatory trials in a timely manner or the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Post-approval requirements for biologics
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by company employees but also by agents of the company or those speaking on the company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
   In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program fee for any marketed product. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 ▪safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 ▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information; 
 ▪fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 ▪holds on clinical trials; 
 ▪refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 ▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 ▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular clinically active component for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
   A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty.
   Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as biologic components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
▪a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
 ▪two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
 ▪a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration or significant change in dose; or 
 ▪any investigational drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect. 
 Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a biologic-device combination product is attributable to the biologic product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office is responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
A combination product with a biologic primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to FDA’s biologic approval processes. In reviewing the BLA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the biologics center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA’s regulations, combination products are subject to applicable current GMP requirements for drugs, biologics and devices, including the Quality System regulations applicable to medical devices.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
   Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the DHHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost/will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products. It is unclear what effect, if any, the American Rescue Plan will have on the number of covered individuals.
Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
▪a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 ▪safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 ▪appropriate for the specific patient; 
 ▪cost-effective; and 
 ▪neither experimental nor investigational. 
 Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs.
   Health Care Laws and Regulations
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation:
▪the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 ▪the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false of fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 
 ▪the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 ▪the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act” under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to HHS information related to physician (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) payments and other transfers of value and the ownership and investment interests of such physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include payments and other transfers of value made in the previous year to certain nonphysician providers, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives; 
 ▪HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, as well as their covered subcontractors, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 ▪analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures; and 
 ▪state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts, and analogous foreign laws and regulations. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.
   Health Care Legislative Updates
Payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies such as gene therapy and therapies addressing rare diseases such as those we are developing. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
   Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, at the federal level, in a recent executive order, the Biden administration expressed its intent to pursue certain policy initiatives to reduce drug prices. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Regulation in the European Union
Drug Development
In the European Union, our product candidates may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the Directive, has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the national competent authority, or CA, and one or more independent ethics committees, or ECs. Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the CA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Regulation, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Regulation will become fully applicable at the end of January 2022. The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU, for instance by providing for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications.
We are in the process of applying to renew our status with EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise, or SME. If we obtain SME status with EMA, it will provide access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures.
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
   Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
▪The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, and we therefore consider our product candidates would fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 ▪National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
As part of its marketing authorization process, the EMA may grant MAs for certain categories of medicinal products on the basis of less complete data than is normally required, where the benefit of immediate availability of the medicine outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required or in the interests of public health. In such cases, it is possible for the CHMP to recommend the granting of an MA, subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually, which is referred to as a conditional marketing authorization. This may apply to medicinal products for human use that fall under the jurisdiction of the EMA, including those that aim at the treatment, the prevention, or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases.
   A conditional marketing authorization may be granted when the CHMP finds that, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, all the following requirements are met:
▪the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is positive; 
 ▪it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data post-authorization; 
 ▪unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; and 
 ▪the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data is still required. 
 The granting of a conditional marketing authorization is restricted to situations in which only the clinical part of the application is not yet fully complete. Incomplete preclinical or quality data may only be accepted if duly justified and only in the case of a product intended to be used in emergency situations in response to public health threats. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis. The MA holder will be required to complete ongoing trials or to conduct new trials with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. In addition, specific obligations may be imposed in relation to the collection of pharmacovigilance data.
Compassionate Use
Compassionate use programs allow for the use of unauthorized medicines for a specific group of patients under strict conditions. The EMA provides recommendations on how a medicine should be used in a compassionate use program and the type of patient who may benefit from treatment, however the individual Member States implement their own rules in respect of the administration of such programs. Competent authorities of the Member States can also ask the EMA for an opinion on how to administer, distribute and use certain medicines for compassionate use.
Compassionate use programs are only available for a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. The medicinal product provided through a compassionate use program must either be the subject of an MA application or must be undergoing clinical trials.
New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EEA, new chemical entities (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions with either (i) affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or (ii) where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition must have been authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
   In the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Pediatric Investigation Plan
In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, extension, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which where is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the European Union or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
   Post-Approval Requirements
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the Member States. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MA applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conducting of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Pricing and Reimbursement
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.
The European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union Member States may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union Member States and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States) can further reduce prices. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs. Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results-based rules of reimbursement may apply.
   European Union Data Collection
The collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, governed by the GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the European Union. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR.
Regulation in the United Kingdom
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The impact of Brexit on the ongoing validity in the UK of current EU authorizations for medicinal products, whether granted through the centralized procedure, decentralized procedure or mutual recognition, and on the future process for obtaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the UK remains uncertain. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement. The Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of the Agreement includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to the Agreement. The Annex provides a framework for the recognition of GMP inspections and for the exchange and acceptance of official GMP documents. The regime does not, however, extended to procedures such as batch release certification. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. As part of the Agreement, the EU and the UK will recognize Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official GMP documents issued by the other party. The Agreement also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The UK has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release for a period of at least two years until January 1, 2023. However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the UK must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use. As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain will have a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national MA. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission.
Clinical Trials
The UK has implemented Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended), and therefore UK legislation currently is broadly aligned with the position in the European Union, where Member State regimes are derived from Directive 2001/20/EC. The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new European Union Regulation once that comes into effect is unknown at present.
Great Britain Marketing Authorizations
As a result of the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized European Union MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland. A separate MA is, however, required in order to place medicinal products on the market in Great Britain.
   On January 1, 2021, all medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure, or ECDRP. Under the ECDRP, submission of an MA application can be submitted to the MHRA at any time after the approval of a European Union MA; however, a delay in submission may affect the delivery of a decision within the specified timelines. Where a submission is made within five days of a positive opinion issued by the CHMP, the MHRA will aim to determine the Great Britain MA as soon as possible after European Commission approval, and by day 67 at the latest provided that the European Commission decision has been received.
The MHRA also offers a 150-day assessment timeline for all high quality applications for a UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland MA. The 150-day timeline does not include a “clock-off” period which may occur if issues arise or points require clarification following an initial assessment of the application. Such issues should be addressed within a 60-day period, although extensions may be granted in exceptional cases.
Early Access to Medicines Scheme
The Early Access to Medicines Scheme, or EAMS, applies in relation to patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions and aims to give such patients access to unauthorized medicines, when there is a clear unmet medical need. Under EAMS, the MHRA will undertake a two-step evaluation process of a medicine, which includes a promising innovative medicine designation (an indication that a product may be eligible for EAMS based on early clinical data) and a scientific opinion on the risks and benefits of the medicine based on data gathered from the patients who will benefit from the medicine. A positive EAMS scientific opinion is valid for one year (which can be renewed) and regular updates must be provided to the MHRA following such positive opinion.
Orphan Designation
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan drug designation to the European Union process has applied Great Britain. There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the European Union) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation remain the same as in the European Union, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g. there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the European Union).
U.S. Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
We collect, store, transmit and process sensitive and confidential data and information, including health information, and personal data. As we seek to expand our business, we are, and will increasingly become, subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, rules and government and industry standards relating to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of sensitive and personal information in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory framework for data privacy, data security and data transfers worldwide is rapidly evolving, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues.
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), and their implementing regulations impose obligations on covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as business associates that provide services involving the use or disclosure of personal health information to or on behalf of covered entities. These obligations, such as mandatory contractual terms, relate to safeguarding the privacy and security of protected health information. Many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. In addition, many states and foreign countries in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information. Certain of these laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other.
   Employees and human capital resources
As of February 28, 2022, we had 52 full-time employees, of which 14 have M.D. (or its equivalent) Ph.D. or J.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 40 employees are engaged in research and development and 12 are engaged in business development, finance, legal and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
