Item 1.  BUSINESS
Our Business 
 
Starco Brands, Inc. (formerly Insynergy Products, Inc.), which we refer to as "the Company," "our Company," "STCB", "we," "us" or "our," was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010 under the name Insynergy, Inc. On September 7, 2017, the Company filed an Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the corporate name to Starco Brands, Inc. The Board determined the change of the Company’s name was in the best interests of the Company due to changes in our current and anticipated business operations at that time. In July 2017, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with The Starco Group ("TSG"), located in Los Angeles, California. TSG is a private label and branded aerosol and liquid fill manufacturer with manufacturing assets in the following verticals: DIY/Hardware, paints, coatings and adhesives, household, hair care, disinfectants, automotive, motorcycle, arts & crafts, personal care cosmetics, personal care FDA, sun care, food, cooking oils, beverages, and spirits and wine. Upon entering into the licensing agreement with TSG, the Company pivoted to commercializing novel consumer products manufactured by TSG.
Executive Overview
 
In July 2017, our Board of Directors entered into a licensing agreement with TSG to pursue a new strategic marketing plan involving commercializing leading edge products with the intent to sell them through brick and mortar and online retailers.  We are a company whose mission is to create behavior-changing products and brands. Our core competency is inventing brands, marketing, building trends, pushing awareness and social marketing. The licensing agreement with TSG provided STCB with certain products on an exclusive and royalty-free basis and other products on a non-exclusive and royalty basis, in the categories of food, household cleaning, air care, spirits and personal care. 
 
The current CEO and owner of TSG, Ross Sklar, was named the CEO of STCB in August of 2017. Mr. Sklar has a long track record of commercializing technology in industrial and consumer markets. Mr. Sklar has built teams of manufacturing personnel, research and development, and sales and marketing professionals over the last 20 years and has grown TSG into a successful and diversified manufacturer supplying a wide range of products to some of the largest retailers in the United States.
 
STCB conducted extensive research and has identified specific channels to penetrate with its portfolio of novel technologies. STCB is now executing on this vision and since its inception has launched four product lines. The Breathe® Household cleaning aerosol line is an environmentally friendly line of household cleaning aerosol products. It is the world’s first aerosol household cleaning line to be approved by the EPA’s Safer Choice program. This line is biodegradable and is propelled by nitrogen, which makes up approximately 80% of the earth’s breathable air. Breathe was named Partner of the Year by the EPA’s Safer Choice Program and also achieved the Good Housekeeping Seal of approval.
 
STCB also launched the Breathe® Hand Sanitizer Spray in April 2020. This invention was created and patents were filed by Alim Enterprises, LLC, (“AE”) an entity owned by Mr. Sklar. Originally the technology was developed for Blue Cross Laboratories, LLC, (“BCL”) a personal care consumer products manufacturer owned by Mr. Sklar’s TSG. The product was developed as a result of supply chain collapse during the Covid-19 outbreak and increased demand for hand sanitizers. The traditional packaging components used in manufacturing hand sanitizer became very difficult to procure. BCL, located in Santa Clarita, California, is an at scale manufacturer that started approximately 50 years ago with personal care products, including hand sanitizer. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, many traditional component supply chains became overly stressed and BCL could not source enough bottles and caps. Through Mr. Sklar’s AE, the concept of a spray hand sanitizer was invented. AE filed patents on what it believes to be the first ever aerosol spray hand sanitizer with a 75% alcohol solution that utilizes only compressed air and nitrogen as the product’s propellant. AE and its intellectual property counsel believe the product is novel and warrants a utility patent. In February 2021, AE assigned the patent application to STCB as contemplated by a 2020 memorandum of understanding among AE, STCB and TSG.
 
The product is being manufactured by BOV Solutions, a division of TSG that is an at scale FDA, CFR210/211 manufacturer of aerosol and OTC products. The Breathe Hand Sanitizer Spray can only be made in an FDA facility that has at scale aerosol capabilities. The product is being sold through BOV Solutions and TSG’s existing distribution footprints in the United States. STCB launched the product in April 2020 via a press release in partnership with Dollar General, announcing its distribution in each of their 15,000+ stores. STCB has also partnered with Wegmans, HLA and J Winkler. Since then, the product is in distribution through The Home Depot, Lowes, American Pharmacy, AutoZone, The Farm Shop, Harris Teeter, UNFI, Kehe, Macy’s, Smart & Final, Weeks and others. The product comes in three sizes, 1oz., 5oz., and 9.5oz. sprays and is available directly on STCB’s website www.breathesanitizer.com and on Amazon.com and Walmart.com.         
 
STCB is also the marketer of record, but not the owner of record of, Betterbilt Chemical’s Kleen Out® branded drain opener and for the Winona® Butter Flavor Popcorn Spray. STCB provides marketing services for these brands pursuant to the terms of agreements governing STCB's marketing. Both products are available in Walmart stores. 
 
Through STCB’s relationship with TSG and their marketing partner Deutsch Marketing, STCB launched a new label in June 2019 for Winona Popcorn Spray throughout all Walmart stores. STCB also launched the Winona Popcorn Spray on Amazon through our strategic partner Pattern (formally iServe), who is a shareholder in STCB. Winona Popcorn Spray is also sold in H-E-B grocery stores. The Company also launched a new caramel flavor which is also distributed through Walmart and H-E-B. Sales grew significantly in 2021 and the Company expects sales to continue to grow in this space as management plans to increase the Company's sales personnel in 2022 for this product line.
 
On September 8, 2021, STCB (via its newly formed Wyoming subsidiary, Whipshots, LLC “Whipshots LLC”) entered into an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement effective August 24, 2021, with Penguins Fly, LLC, pursuant to which the Company purchased the trademarks “Whipshotz” and “Whipshots”. The purchase price for these trademarks is payable to Penguins Fly, LLC over the course of seven years, based on a sliding scale percentage between 2% and 5% of gross revenues actually received by the Company solely from the Company’s sale of Whipshots/Whipshotz products.
 
On September 14, 2021, STCB (via newly formed Delaware subsidiary Whipshots LLC (DE), which was subsequently renamed to Whipshots Holdings LLC “Whipshots Holdings”), entered into a License Agreement with Washpoppin Inc., a New York corporation (“Washpoppin”) pursuant to which Washpoppin licensed certain intellectual property of the recording artist professionally known as “Cardi B” to the Company for use associated with the Company’s new product line consisting of vodka-infused, whipped-cream aerosols, under the brand name “Whipshots.” The Company launched these products under the Whipshots™ brand in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. In addition, STCB entered into Distribution Agreements with various distributors pursuant to which such distributors will act as the exclusive distributors of Whipshots™ in various geographic locations.

On December 2, 2021, the Company launched Whipshots at Art Basel in Miami.  This launch event garnered over 1 billion impressions world-wide.  The Company launched the product on whipshots.com with a limited quantity of cans to be sold each day for the month of December.  The Company sold out every single day of the month.  The Company launched brick and mortar retail distribution in the first quarter of 2022 and signed a distribution agreement with RNDC, one of the largest spirits distributors in the nation.  The Company also announced a distribution deal with GoPuff and BevMo.  The Company expects to register Whipshots in all states but is starting in select markets with plans to grow cautiously.
 
As long as the Company can raise capital, the Company plans to launch other products in spray foods and condiments, air care, sun care, hair care, personal care, spirits and beverages over the next 48 months. Although the initial market reception to our new lines has been encouraging, the Company may encounter a number of hurdles that could prevent this and future product launches from achieving sustained commercial success. Financing growth and launching of new products is key and the Company’s ability to raise further capital is critical. In December 2021, the Company pursued financing via a Regulation A offering which was qualified on December 9, 2021. The Company engaged The Dalmore Group to assist as the broker dealer of record in this process, in which up to 56,818,181 shares of common stock may be sold to the public at a per share price of $1.00.
 
We will need to rely on sales of our common stock and other sources of financing to raise additional capital. The purchasers and manner of any share issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company is planning to utilize, as best as possible with limited financing, the services of Deutsch Marketing in order to help support the Company’s plan. The Company will also utilize the marketing capabilities of Hearst Media with its co-branding arrangement on some of its products. This provides significant support for its current retail and online distribution.  
 
The Company’s ultimate goal is to become a leading brand owner and third-party marketer of cutting edge technologies in the consumer products marketplace whose success is expected to increase shareholder value. The Company will continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to further set its strategy for 2022 and beyond.
