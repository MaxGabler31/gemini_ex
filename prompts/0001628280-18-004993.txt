ITEM 1.    Business
Company Overview
Incorporated in 1989, the Company is a provider of transformational data-driven solutions for healthcare, improving healthcare providers’ financial performance by moving later revenue cycle interventions earlier in the process via optimizing coding accuracy for every patient encounter prior to bill submission. By improving coding accuracy before billing, providers can reduce revenue leakage, mitigate the risk of overbilling, and reduce denials and days in accounts receivable. This enables providers to turn previously unpredictable revenue cycles into more predictable revenue streams. 
The Company provides computer software-based solutions and auditing services, which capture, aggregate and translate structured and unstructured data to deliver intelligently organized, easily accessible predictive insights to its clients. Hospitals and physician groups use the knowledge generated by Streamline Health® to help them improve their financial performance.
The Company’s software solutions are delivered to clients either by a purchased fixed-term or perpetual license, where such software is installed locally in the client’s data center, or by access to the Company’s data center systems through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery method.
The Company operates exclusively in one segment as a provider of health information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flows within a healthcare facility. The Company sells its solutions and services in North America to hospitals and health systems, including physician practices, through its direct sales force and its reseller partnerships.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Streamline Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” are intended to mean Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year commencing February 1 in that calendar year and ending on January 31 of the following calendar year.
Solutions
The Company offers solutions and services to assist its clients in revenue cycle management including Health Information Management (HIM), Coding and Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) and Financial Management. The Company’s solutions are designed to improve the flow of critical patient information throughout the enterprise. The solutions and services help to transform and structure information between disparate information technology systems into actionable data, giving the end user comprehensive access to clinical and business intelligence to enable better decision-making. Solutions can be delivered either by a perpetual license installed locally, or by a fixed-term license installed locally or accessed securely through SaaS.    
HIM, Coding & CDI Solutions - These solutions provide an integrated cloud-based software suite that enhances the productivity of CDI and Coding staff and enables the seamless sharing of patient data. This suite of solutions includes individual workflows such as content management (ECM), release of information, computer-assisted coding (eCAC), CDI, abstracting and physician query. The eCAC solution includes patented Natural Language Processing (NLP) that streamlines concurrent chart review and coding workflows.
eValuatorTM Coding Analysis Platform - This new technology is a cloud-based SaaS analytics solution that delivers the capability of a fully automated analysis on 100% of billing codes entered by a healthcare provider’s coding team. This is done on a pre-bill basis, enabling providers to identify and address their highest-impact cases prior to bill drop. Rule sets are enabled for inpatient, outpatient and pro-fee cases. With eValuator, providers can add an audit and review function on a pre-bill basis to all cases, allowing the provider to better optimize reimbursements and mitigate risk on its billing practices. 
Financial Management Solutions - These solutions enable financial staff across the healthcare enterprise to drill down quickly and deeply into actionable and real-time financial data and key performance indicators to improve revenue realization and staff efficiency. This suite of solutions includes individual workflows such as accounts receivable management, denials management, claims processing, spend management and audit management. These solutions provide dashboards, data mining tools and prescriptive reporting, which help to simplify, facilitate and optimize overall revenue cycle performance of the healthcare enterprise. These solutions are also used to increase the completion and accuracy of patient charts and related coding, improve accounts receivable collections, reduce and manage denials, and improve audit outcomes.
Patient Care Solution - The Company’s Clinical Analytics solution enables healthcare providers to improve their patient care via cohort building and data visualization, fostering an open, continuous learning culture inside a healthcare organization, empowering it with real-time, on-demand predicative insight for improved patient outcomes.

Contracts, License and Services Fees
The Company enters into agreements with its clients that specify the scope of the system to be installed and/or services to be provided by the Company, as well as the agreed-upon aggregate price, applicable term duration and the timetable for the associated licenses and services. 
For clients purchasing software to be installed locally or provided on a SaaS model, these are multi-element arrangements that include either a perpetual or term license and right to access the applicable software functionality (whether installed locally at the client site or the right to use the Company’s solutions as a part of SaaS services), terms regarding maintenance and support services, terms for any third-party components such as hardware and software, and professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, optimization and training, as well as fees and payment terms for each of the foregoing. If the client purchases solutions on a perpetual license model, the client is billed the license fee up front. Maintenance and support is provided on a term basis for separate fees, with an initial term typically from one to five years in length. The maintenance and support fee is charged annually in advance, commencing either upon contract execution or deployment of the solution in live production. If the client purchases solutions on a term-based model, the client is billed periodically a combined access fee for a specified term, typically from one to seven years in length. The access fee includes the access rights along with all maintenance and support services. 
The Company also generally provides software and SaaS clients professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, optimization and training. These services and the associated fees are separate from the license, maintenance and access fees. Professional services are provided on either a fixed-fee or hourly arrangements billable to clients based on agreed-to payment milestones (fixed fee) or monthly payment structure on hours incurred (hourly). These services can either be included at the time the related locally installed software or SaaS solution is licensed as part of the initial purchase agreement, or added on afterward as an addendum to the existing agreement for services required after the initial implementation. 
For coding audit services clients, these review services are provided either through a stand-alone services agreement or services addendum to an existing master agreement with the client. These review services are available as either a one-time service or recurring monthly, quarterly or annual review structure. These services are typically provided on a per reviewed account/chart basis. Monthly minimums are required where material discounts have been offered. Payment typically occurs upon completion of the applicable review project. 
The commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system and/or services involved, the implementation or performance schedule requested by the client and usage by clients of SaaS for software-based components. The Company’s agreements are generally non-cancelable but provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by the Company and/or or may delay certain aspects of the installation or associated payments in such events. The Company does allow for termination for convenience in certain situations. The Company also includes trial or evaluation periods for certain clients, especially for new or modified solutions. Therefore, it is difficult for the Company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period, and a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement, or the failure of the Company to procure additional agreements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, as further discussed in Section 1A Risk Factors herein. Historically, the Company has not experienced a material amount of contract cancellations; however, the Company sometimes experiences delays in the course of contract performance and the Company accounts for them accordingly.
Third-Party License Fees
The Company incorporates software licensed from various third-party vendors into its proprietary software. Stand-alone third-party software is also required to operate certain of the Company’s proprietary software and/or SaaS services. The Company licenses these software products and pays the required license fees when such software is delivered to clients. For information regarding royalty agreements, see Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein.
Associates
As of January 31, 2018, the Company had 116 employees (with 113 as full-time employees and 3 as part-time employees), a net decrease of 13 during fiscal 2017. The Company utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff, as needed. None of the Company’s associates are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good. The Company’s success depends, to a significant degree, on its management, sales and technical personnel.
For more information on contracts, backlog, acquisitions and research and development, see also Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Competition

Index to Financial Statements

Regarding our Patient Care Solutions, HIM, Coding and CDI Solutions, eValuatorTM Coding Analysis Platform, and Financial Management Solutions, several companies historically have dominated the clinical information system software market and several of these companies have either acquired, developed or are developing their own document management and workflow technologies. The industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively. Strategic alliances between vendors offering HIM workflow and document management technologies and vendors of other healthcare systems are increasing. Barriers to entry to this market include technological and application sophistication, the ability to offer a proven product, creating and utilizing a well-established client base and distribution channels, brand recognition, the ability to operate on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms, the ability to integrate with pre-existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities. The Company has many competitors including clinical information system vendors that are larger, more established and have substantially more resources than the Company.
Regarding our Audit Services, there are numerous medium and small companies and independent consultants who offer these services. Barriers to entry to this market include creating and utilizing a well-established client base and distribution channels, brand recognition, establishing differentiators for our services and capital for sustained development and marketing activities. 
The Company believes that these obstacles taken together represent a moderate to high-level barrier to entry. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are client recommendations and references, company reputation, system reliability, system features and functionality (including ease of use), technological advancements, client service and support, breadth and quality of the systems, the potential for enhancements and future compatible products, the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts, price, and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor. In addition, the Company believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors.
Additional Intellectual Property Rights
In addition to the software licenses described in other sections of this Item 1, “Business”, the Company also holds registered trademarks for its Streamline Health® and other key trademarks used in selling our products. These marks are currently active, with registrations being valid for a period of 3 years each. The Company actively renews these marks at the end of each registration period. 
Regulation
Our clients derive a substantial portion of their revenue from third-party private and governmental payors, including through Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs. Our clients also have express handling and retention obligations under information-based laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. There are no material regulatory proposals of which the Company is aware that we believe currently have a high likelihood of passage that we anticipate would have a material impact on the operation or demand of the Company’s products and services. However, the Company acknowledges there is currently great uncertainty in the US healthcare market generally from a regulatory perspective. In addition, there is regulatory uncertainty in the data and technology sectors as it relates to information security regulations. Material changes could have unanticipated impact on demand or usability of the Company’s solutions, require the Company to incur additional development and/or operating costs (on a one-time or recurring basis) or cause clients to terminate their agreements or otherwise be unable to pay amounts owed to the Company, as further discussed in the risk factors in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” herein.
