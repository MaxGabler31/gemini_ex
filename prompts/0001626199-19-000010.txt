Overview
Our company is focused on discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer, autoimmune/inflammatory disorders, and other diseases. Our proprietary scientific platform uses a process known as directed evolution to convert native immune system proteins from the Immunoglobulin Super Family, or IgSF, into multi-targeted therapeutics potentially capable of modulating the human immune system.
Our lead program is ALPN-101, a dual ICOS and CD28 antagonist intended for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Preclinical data have demonstrated potential efficacy in models of graft versus host disease, or GvHD, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. In January 2019, we initiated dosing in a Phase I healthy volunteer study in Australia. We anticipate presenting data from this study at a conference in 2020 and using the data from this study to begin one or more proof-of-concept Phase II studies in indications such as psoriatic arthritis and GvHD. Our goal is to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, or IND-equivalent in 2019 for a Phase Ib trial of ALPN-101 in GvHD.
Our second program is ALPN-202, a dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 antagonist with PD-L1 dependent CD28 costimulation intended for the treatment of cancer. Preclinical data have demonstrated potential efficacy in tumor models with an immune stimulatory profile significantly different than PD-L1 checkpoint antagonism alone. Our goal is to file an IND or IND-equivalent in 2019 for authorization to initiate human clinical trials with ALPN-202.
Our scientific platform has also generated immune modulatory proteins with the potential of improving engineered cellular therapies, or ECT, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T, T cell receptor-engineered T cells, or TCR-T, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs. In October 2015, we signed a collaboration agreement with Kite Pharma (now a Gilead Company), or Kite, covering two IgSF targets addressable by our platform. Separate from this collaboration, we have developed multifunctional proteins based on other IgSF targets with the potential to improve CAR-T, TCR-T, TILs, and oncolytic virus based therapies.
Based on these advancements and other preclinical data to date, our scientific platform has proven capable of identifying novel molecules - including single domains capable of modulating multiple targets. These molecules have demonstrated efficacy in in vitro as well as in vivo preclinical models. We believe therapeutics generated by our scientific platform have the potential to provide benefit in a broad range of immune system disorders. 
Immunology Background
Our therapies are being evaluated for their potential to target immune system disorders, including oncology (cancer), and inflammatory/autoimmune disease. Based on preclinical data generated to date, we believe therapeutics generated by our platform have the potential to provide patient benefit in a broad range of immune system disorders. We have chosen to focus our initial efforts on select therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs in oncology and inflammatory/autoimmune disease.
The human immune system is a complex system evolved to protect the host from external infection and harmful alterations of the body’s own cells. At the most basic level, this system has evolved to detect antigens. Antigens are essentially anything causing the immune system to try and mount an immune response. Antigens vary from pathogens like a virus, mutated cells like those involved in causing cancer, or even otherwise healthy cells. In special situations such as transplanted organs or cells from a bone marrow transplant, the body sees antigens from these otherwise normal cells as “non-self”.
The immune system determines if an antigen is harmful or not, and then acts accordingly—activating to destroy cells displaying the target antigen or inhibiting the immune system from doing anything if the target antigen is determined not harmful. The immune system has a memory for antigens so it can mount an activating or inhibitory response more quickly if a previously-seen antigen is encountered again.
The basic actors within the immune system are as follows:

• | Antigen presenting cells, or APCs, responsible for gathering antigens and presenting them to the immune system.


• | T cells armed to destroy cells the immune system has decided are harmful—including pathogens, cancer cells, and transplanted cells.

2


• | B cells capable of recognizing foreign antigens and secreting antibodies to facilitate removal of the identified antigens.


• | Regulatory T cells and suppressive myeloid cells which inhibit the immune system from responding, preventing the immune system from attacking healthy cells.

Importantly, the APCs in the immune system gather antigens to determine whether they are harmful or not. If the antigens are determined harmful by the immune system, cytotoxic (effector) cells are activated to eliminate the harmful cells. If the antigens are determined not harmful by the immune system, regulatory cells inhibit the immune system to ensure no normal healthy cells are eliminated. There are several components and signaling pathways involved in regulating the activation or inhibition of the immune system.
Activation and inhibition can be thought of like applying the gas or pressing the brake in an automobile. When viewed through the lens of activation (costimulation) and inhibition, our scientists work to develop therapies seeking to do one of four things:

• | Deliver an activating signal (press on the gas) to get a stronger immune response


• | Block an inhibitory signal (release the brake) to get a stronger immune response


• | Deliver an inhibitory signal (press on the brake) to slow down an existing immune response


• | Block an activating signal (release the gas) to slow down an existing immune response

The above can also be expressed in more precise scientific terminology this way:

• | Agonize a costimulatory receptor to press on the gas


• | Antagonize an inhibitory receptor to release the brake


• | Agonize an inhibitory receptor to press on the brake


• | Antagonize a costimulatory receptor to release the gas

For cancer, patients need a stronger immune response, so we seek to develop therapies delivering an activating signal, blocking an inhibitory signal, or both. If a patient has an inflammatory/autoimmune disease or has received a transplant, we seek to develop therapies delivering an inhibitory signal, blocking an activating signal, or both. 
Inflammatory/Autoimmune Disease
Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases like arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (“lupus”), inflammatory myositis (for example, polymyositis and dermatomyositis), Sjögren’s syndrome, Type I diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease are a result of the immune system targeting the body’s healthy tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 known types of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, many of which are severely debilitating and/or life threatening. A related condition is when a transplant patient’s body attacks the newly transplanted organ (host versus graft rejection) or, in the case of stem cell transplants, the newly transplanted cells attack the patient’s body (graft versus host disease). These are all immune system disorders caused by the immune system having too much activation or too little inhibition. For simplicity, we will refer to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as simply “inflammatory diseases”.
Substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing disease-modifying therapies to slow or stop disease progression in multiple inflammatory diseases. Inhibitors of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, as well as approved drugs like abatacept, which blocks T cell costimulation, have led to disease reductions and improvements in quality of life for patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases.
Our therapeutic goal in inflammatory disease is to press on the brake by delivering an inhibitory signal or release the gas by blocking an activating signal. We believe one novel aspect of our proprietary scientific platform is the potential ability to create a single protein-based therapeutic capable of doing both. We do not currently have a therapeutic targeting inflammatory disease on the market. However, based upon evidence from preclinical studies to date, we believe our scientific platform has the potential to produce IgSF‑based therapeutics targeting inflammatory diseases.

Oncology
Cancer is broadly defined as normal human cells growing in an uncontrolled fashion and capable of spreading this aberrant activity elsewhere in the body. Cancer can also be seen as a failure of the immune system to recognize transformed, harmful cells. Tumors develop because cancer cells learn to evade the immune system or dampen immune system activity to such a low level the tumor grows despite an otherwise healthy immune system.
Traditional cancer treatments have focused on directly killing tumor cells using toxic chemicals like chemotherapy or other approaches like irradiating cells. The 2010 FDA approval of sipuleucel-T marked a meaningful change in how tumors are treated. Sipuleucel-T represented the FDA’s first approval of an active cancer immunotherapy. It was designed to help a patient’s immune system attack prostate cancer cells. Brought to FDA approval by one of the founders of our company, the approval of sipuleucel-T energized the field to focus more closely on how to make use of the immune system to treat cancer.
The subsequent development of therapies targeting “checkpoint inhibitors” or pathways responsible for inhibiting an immune response has resulted in several FDA-approved therapeutics. Targeting checkpoint inhibitors, thereby releasing the brake on the immune system, has provided meaningful efficacy for a subset of cancer patients.
The first drug approved in this therapeutic class was ipilimumab, an antibody interfering with inhibitory signals from an IgSF protein called CTLA-4. In 2014, two antibodies blocking the inhibitory IgSF protein PD-1— pembrolizumab and nivolumab—were approved in multiple indications, and a third, cemiplimab, was approved in 2018. Antagonists of the IgSF protein PD-L1 have also been approved in multiple indications, including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab.
In addition to modulators of these IgSF proteins, several other immunotherapies for cancer are either approved or in development including engineered cellular therapies (CAR-T, TCR-T and TILs), cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses.
Our Scientific Platform
The human immune system is a complex system evolved to protect humans from external infections and harmful changes of internal cells. The Immunoglobulin Superfamily (abbreviated “IgSF”) is the name given to the largest family of adhesion, costimulatory (activating), and inhibitory (blocking) proteins found on the surface of immunological, neurological, and other human cell types. These cell surface and soluble molecules are broadly involved with recognition of antigens, assisting in the formation of the immune synapse, and performing costimulatory, coinhibitory, and cytokine receptor signaling functions. This family includes many well-known targets, such as those seen in Figure 1.
Figure 1
Our scientific approach and platform are based upon IgSF protein units (referred to as “domains”). We believe the IgSF protein family is particularly valuable because many IgSF proteins naturally bind multiple binding partners, also referred to as “counterstructures”.
IgSF proteins are the principal players in the immune synapse, which is another reason we chose to focus our scientific platform on IgSF proteins. Immune synapses are a temporary, dynamic interaction required for the immune system’s response to antigens. When the synapse is created between two cells (like an APC and a T cell, or a tumor cell and a T cell), adhesion molecules hold cell membranes in tight formation to enable sufficient antigen presentation and/or receptor signaling. When this exchange works well, the body is adequately defended against a wide range of pathologies, including cancer and infectious diseases. When this exchange malfunctions, harmful cells are not destroyed or normal/healthy cells are mistakenly attacked - eventually resulting in inflammatory diseases. We believe our scientific platform represents a novel approach to targeting the immune system. Our scientists create Variant Ig Domains, or vIgDs through directed evolution, which is an iterative scientific 
4

engineering process purposefully conducted to engineer an IgSF protein for a desired therapeutic function. The potential to create therapies capable of working within a formed synapse, forcing a synapse to occur, or preventing a synapse from occurring are important, novel attributes of our scientific platform.
The immune synapse is very small and often exists for just minutes. While intact, cells forming the synapse exchange a wide variety of information. Environmental cues, ligand/receptor expression ratios, and specific receptor orientations come together in a dynamic fashion to determine whether a T cell is going to respond to a given antigen or recognize it as harmless. 
Our scientific platform seeks to engineer native, or so-called “wild-type” IgSFs, turning them into therapeutics with potential benefit to patients with cancer or inflammatory diseases. We believe our scientific platform represents a novel approach to targeting the immune system. 
We believe the key advantages to our approach are:

• | potential broad applicability since many critical immuno-regulatory proteins are composed of IgSF members;


• | potentially rapid and precise selection of desired binding properties; and


• | potential recovery of affinity-modified proteins biased towards a well-folded, non-aggregated, and stable subset of proteins.

Figure 2 shows the process of directed evolution in our scientific platform. Our scientists utilize yeast display protein library strategies to identify variants of wild-type IgSFs with desired binding characteristics via so-called “affinity maturation” campaigns. We start with a wild-type IgSF protein and then enter a cycle of library generation and yeast display. Flow cytometry or other methods are used to sort for yeast clones displaying variants with desired binding characteristics. Biologic and biophysical assays of purified proteins assess biological function and manufacturing characteristics. The end product is an optimized vIgD. Additional cycles can be carried out by building next generation libraries from the output of prior libraries to result in further optimization.
Figure 2
Our scientific platform is generally able to improve upon native IgSF activity regardless of whether natural binding affinity is weak or strong. When starting affinity is very weak, techniques employed by our scientists have accomplished several thousand-fold increases in binding affinity with sometimes as few as two library generation cycles. Even when starting affinity is very high, our scientific platform can still improve binding affinities. The same general strategies can be used when the desired therapeutic profile requires reduced affinity compared to the wild-type IgSF.
5

We believe the advantages of our scientific platform allow us to identify new biology. Our lead program, ALPN-101, is an example where a single wild-type ICOSL domain, normally only binding ICOS with any physiological relevance, is engineered as a vIgD able to bind both ICOS and CD28. We have accomplished analogous modifications in other programs directed to disclosed and undisclosed targets, including the disclosed targets in Figure 3.
Figure 3
In preclinical animal models, we find our engineered vIgDs can outperform the relevant wild-type IgSF protein and/or other reference molecules when the vIgD differs from the wild-type IgSF by as few as one to three mutations. Based on in silico analyses and analogous FDA-approved therapies, we do not believe vIgDs are unusually susceptible to immunogenic effects causing adverse events or loss of drug activity.
Our scientific platform is highly productive. A single library run through the directed evolution process can potentially create vIgDs useful in both oncology and inflammatory diseases. While this potential advantage is not universal for every IgSF target, our experience is most of our successful discovery campaigns result in vIgDs applicable to a broad variety of therapeutic protein designs . We believe this is a novel attribute given most other platforms require each molecule to be painstakingly purpose-built for each intended therapeutic area.
6

We believe our vIgDs are highly flexible. In many cases, a single affinity-maturation campaign can result in potential multiple domains suitable for use in the formats such as those illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4
vIgD-Fc
The vIgD-Fc fusion protein is the simplest format. Our lead autoimmune/inflammation program, ALPN-101, and lead oncology program, ALPN‑202, are both examples of vIgD-Fc formats. The engineered vIgD protein is fused to an Fc backbone. Combining vIgDs with antibody Fc domains to make Fc fusion proteins potentially allows for better expression, facilitates purification, and improves pharmacokinetic (dosing) properties. Fc fusion proteins are a standard format in the industry, with examples such as etanercept, abatacept, and belatacept. A vIgD-Fc could potentially be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, or other methods of delivery.
Multifunction vIgD-based Molecule
Multiple vIgDs can be combined or “stacked” together with or without an Fc backbone to create a multifunctional, vIgD-based molecule. With the potential to make use of novel biology discovered using our scientific platform, an Fc fusion with just two domains can potentially affect three, four, or more IgSF targets
V-mAb
Our V-mAb technology potentially allows targeting a vIgD into the tumor microenvironment with a monoclonal antibody. A V-mAb is a vIgD joined with a monoclonal antibody recognizing a validated target (as depicted in Figure 4). Our V-mAbs use the targeting antibody to localize the vIgD to the tumor micro-environment or target tissue to potentially deliver specific, locally-active immuno-modulation.
Cell Therapy Enhancement
Our scientific platform has also generated immune modulatory proteins with the potential of improving engineered cellular therapies, such as CAR-Ts, TCR-Ts, or TILs. 
Collaboration with Kite Pharma, a Gilead Company
In addition to advancing programs internally, we continue to seek partners who can bring therapeutic area experience, development expertise, commercialization capabilities, and funding allowing us to maximize the potential of vIgDs and our scientific platform. In October 2015, we signed a research and license agreement with Kite, granting Kite an exclusive license to two of our TIP programs for use in Kite’s ECT programs. Under the terms of the license and research agreement with Kite, we have conducted initial research to deliver two program TIPs with certain pre-defined characteristics, and we are further responsible for conducting a research plan to deliver TIPs to two specified IgSF targets.
We received $5.5 million in up-front cash and are eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in developmental, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments in addition to royalties on any products containing our TIPs. In October 2017, we entered into an amendment with Kite to extend the research term of the Collaboration Agreement. Under the amendment, we are eligible to receive an additional $450,000 research support payment from Kite in two tranches (instead of a single tranche as previously contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement). In June 2018, we recognized the remaining deferred balance and the 
7

first support payment under the amendment. In October 2018, we entered into another amendment with Kite, which amended portions of the research plan.
ALPN-101, a Dual ICOS/CD28 Antagonist for Inflammatory Diseases
Our lead inflammatory disease program, ALPN-101, is comprised of a novel single domain vIgD binding both ICOS and CD28 at higher affinity than wild-type molecules. This vIgD is fused to an effectorless Fc backbone and is intended for the potential treatment of certain inflammatory diseases.
Notably, ALPN-101 is not a bispecific antibody construct. A traditional bispecific would be constructed of one domain binding ICOS and one domain binding CD28. Instead, ALPN-101 makes use of a novel single domain protein vIgD engineered by our scientists using our proprietary scientific platform.
Inducible T cell Costimulator, or ICOS, is part of the CD28 costimulatory family of molecules, including PD-1, CD28, and CTLA-4. ICOS is related to CD28, but, in contrast, is poorly expressed in naïve T cells. ICOS is, however, rapidly induced upon T cell activation. It appears to be a dominant costimulatory pathway in at least some effector or pathogenic T cells, such as potentially in the absence of CD28. Elevated levels of ICOS‑expressing T cells have been described in an increasing number of inflammatory diseases, correlating with disease activity. At the same time, inhibition of ICOS is effective in several preclinical inflammatory disease models. The ICOS pathway may therefore represent a major costimulatory pathway, nonredundant with CD28, and highly relevant to inflammatory diseases.
Cluster of Differentiation 28 (“CD28”) is the dominant costimulatory pathway in naïve, antigen-inexperienced T cells, and is required for their activation. However, optimal and/or durable development of activated and/or effector T cells often occurs independently of CD28. CD28 expression becomes progressively reduced during longer-term activation in at least some T cell populations, and CD28-negative T cells have been observed in a growing number of inflammatory diseases, often correlated with disease activity. 
While CD28 and ICOS both provide costimulatory signals, there is potentially a time-shifted dynamic to their evolved immune functions with CD28 providing initial costimulation and ICOS providing longer-term costimulatory effects. During activation, T cells eventually lose their dependence on CD28. ICOS, however, begins to be upregulated to provide an additional costimulatory signal.
Since ALPN-101 addresses potential deficiencies of single pathway blockade via its dual mechanism, we believe it is capable of delivering deeper clinical responses by blocking two key T cell costimulatory pathways with a single therapeutic. This hypothesis is supported by clinical data from CD28-only and ICOS-only therapeutics, both of which demonstrate only partial efficacy. Therapeutic agents directed against the CD28 pathway alone, such as the FDA-approved therapeutic abatacept, have proven only partially effective or ineffective in some inflammatory diseases, and/or induce only partial disease improvement in their approved indications.9 While few studies have examined the effect of therapeutic blockade of ICOS in humans, early clinical trial findings with the anti ICOSL monoclonal antibody prezalumab suggest inhibition of the ICOS pathway alone may also be insufficient to achieve complete remission in many inflammatory conditions.
We have performed a number of pre-clinical experiments demonstrating ALPN‑101 is active in both in vitro and in vivo models.

Superior Activity in Human Xenograft GvHD Model
ALPN-101 has been studied in an in vivo mouse model of GvHD, a damaging and even potentially fatal inflammatory disease most often brought about during stem cell and/or bone marrow transplant treatments for cancer or other serious diseases. 
The results represented in Figure 5 shows ALPN-101 had superior survival when dosed three times per week for four weeks compared to belatacept (an FDA-approved drug for prevention of renal allograft rejection – a type of inflammation-related rejection process analogous to GvHD). In fact, 100% of ALPN-101 multi-dose treated animals across three different dose levels survived. Animals given only a single dose of ALPN-101 performed comparably to animals treated with belatacept dosed 3x/week for four weeks, demonstrating the potency and efficacy of ALPN-101 in this disease model.
Figure 5
Arthritis Model
Figure 6 shows data from an in vivo collagen-induced arthritis model. This model is designed to test a drug’s ability to reduce inflammatory signals associated with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and other types of inflammatory arthritis conditions. In this experiment, an early molecule in the ALPN-101 program was superior to abatacept, a drug approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, in preventing arthritic inflammation. 
Figure 6

Inflammatory Bowel Disease Model
Inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, is a disease caused by dysregulation of the immune system characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease, ALPN-101 demonstrated nearly complete control of disease in the subject animals as seen in Figure 7.
Figure 7
Multiple Sclerosis Model
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is an abnormal response of the body’s immune system directed against the central nervous system, or CNS. The CNS is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. In an animal model of MS, ALPN-101 demonstrated improved disease scores compared to abatacept and superior disease scores against wild-type ICOSL as seen in Figure 8.
Figure 8
Summary of ALPN-101 Program Preclinical Data
Our scientists and collaborators have demonstrated in preclinical studies that ALPN-101:

• | improves survival compared to belatacept in an in vivo animal GvHD model;


• | reduces disease severity and delays disease onset time relative to control in a pilot in vivo arthritis model with activity superior to abatacept, an FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis;


• | demonstrates control of IBD in an animal model of IBD; and


• | shows improved disease scores in an animal model of MS compared to abatacept.

ALPN-101 Clinical Plans
In January 2019, we initiated dosing in a Phase I trial of ALPN-101 in healthy volunteers, referred to as our AIS-A01 trial. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending intravenous and/or subcutaneous doses of ALPN-101. In addition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory biomarkers are being evaluated to help determine ALPN-101’s potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The trial is being conducted in Australia. More information is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03748836). We expect to present data from the AIS-A01 clinical trial at a conference in 2020.
We plan to file an IND or IND-equivalent for a Phase Ib trial of ALPN-101 in GvHD in 2019. GvHD is a damaging and even potentially fatal inflammatory disease most often brought about during stem cell and/or bone marrow transplant treatments for cancer or other serious diseases. With a mortality rate of 75% or more, GvHD is an inflammatory disease which has been particularly challenging for development of new therapies and where there exists a substantial unmet need. Over the last two decades, a multitude of therapies including stem cell transplant, IL-2 antagonists, antithymocyte globulin, anti-CD52, anti-TNF therapies, and others have been studied. While ibrutinib was recently approved for chronic GvHD, as of December 31, 2018 there are no approved therapies for the treatment of acute GvHD and a significant number of chronic GvHD patients did not have durable responses to ibrutinib. 
We anticipate using the data from the AIS-A01 trial to begin proof-of-concept Phase II studies in inflammatory diseases such as psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the joints, typically associated with psoriasis, an itchy, flaky skin condition. Both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are inflammatory diseases, meaning that they occur when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, in this case the joints and skin. The faulty immune response causes inflammation that triggers joint pain, stiffness and swelling. The inflammation can affect the entire body and may lead to permanent joint and tissue damage if it is not treated early and aggressively. 
ALPN-202, a Dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 Antagonist with PD-L1 Dependent CD28 Costimulation for Oncology
ALPN-202 is our lead program for immuno-oncology. Our scientists used wild‑type CD80 as the basis for a directed evolution campaign using our proprietary scientific platform. They were able to create a vIgD capable of antagonizing PD-L1 and CTLA-4, while delivering PD-L1 dependent costimulation via CD28. 
Programmed cell death protein ligand 1, or PD-L1, and its counterstructure, PD-1, are responsible for suppressing immune system responses. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated protein 4, or CTLA-4, also suppresses immune system responses. Both are IgSFs commonly referred to as checkpoint proteins since they act as inhibitory checks against immune system activation, pressing the brakes on an immune reaction. As noted above, CD28 provides a costimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation and survival. 
It has long been recognized CD28 is required for T cell activation and CD28 is considered the most important of the costimulatory molecules. The tumor microenvironment often features exhausted T cells suppressed via PD-1/PD-L1 engagement as seen on the left of Figure 9 below. The development of anti PD-1/L1 mAbs have helped relieve one aspect of the exhausted phenotype, but less than 30% of patients typically respond – likely attributable to the minority of patients who do have sufficient CD28 costimulation as depicted in the center panel of Figure 9. More recent research has, in fact, suggested CD28 costimulation is required for anti PD-1/L1 efficacy, absent which tumors do not respond due to inadequate costimulation as seen in the third panel of Figure 9. Therefore, there may be a need for a therapeutic providing both checkpoint antagonism and CD28 costimulation.
Figure 9
11

The goal of the ALPN-202 program is to create a therapeutic capable of blocking checkpoint inhibition to take the brakes off the immune system while providing for CD28 costimulation to step on the gas and increase immune system response. We believe ALPN-202 has three modes of activity:

• | antagonize PD-L1 to decrease PD-L1’s ability to inhibit immune response;


• | agonize CD28 to increase immune response, but only in the presence of PD‑L1—a potential mechanism of action we call PD-L1 “dependent” activity; and


• | antagonize CTLA-4 to decrease CTLA-4’s ability to inhibit immune response.

This triple-action mechanism has been accomplished with a single vIgD domain-based protein. The fact we have engineered a single vIgD to accomplish this, instead of relying on multiple IgSF domains fused together, represents a potentially important scientific advance and emphasizes the potential power of our scientific platform to create novel therapeutics. We are currently studying ALPN-202 using in vivo models to better characterize its activity against tumors and performing appropriate enabling work towards our goal of filing an IND or IND-equivalent in the fourth quarter of 2019 for our first ALPN-202 human clinical trial.
In a mouse model where mice were implanted with mouse colon cancer tumors transfected with human PD-L1, ALPN-202 as a monotherapy demonstrated superior tumor control compared to durvalumab, an FDA-approved anti PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (Figure 10).
Figure 10
When tumor-free mice in the ALPN-202 arm of the same experiment were re-challenged with additional tumor, they continued to be tumor free despite no additional doses of ALPN-202. This potentially demonstrates ALPN-202 confers persistent anti-tumor immunity (Figure 11).
Figure 11
12

In a similar model of human PD-L1 transduced mouse colon cancer, the effects of ALPN-202 or durvalumab on various components of the immune system were compared using a technique called RNA sequencing. This technique generates a display of inflammatory gene signatures where green represents lower or no upregulation of inflammatory genes and red represents higher upregulation of inflammatory genes. For the treatment of cancer, it is thought the more upregulation of the immune system - indicated by higher upregulation of inflammatory genes - potentially results in better outcomes for patients.16 As seen in Figure 12 below, ALPN-202 upregulates a broader variety of different inflammatory genes connected with several different types of immune cells compared to durvalumab.

Summary of ALPN-202 Preclinical Data
Our scientists have demonstrated in preclinical studies that ALPN-202:

• | improves survival in a human PD-L1 transduced mouse model of colon cancer compared to the FDA approved anti PD-L1 therapeutic durvalumab;


• | creates potentially persistent anti-tumor immunity in the same model, as demonstrated by mice remaining tumor free after rechallenge, even without additional doses of ALPN-202; and


• | demonstrates a more robust intra-tumor inflammatory signature in the mouse colon cancer model than durvalumab, potentially indicating superior immune system upregulation to fight cancer.

ALPN-202 Program Clinical Plans
Our goal is to file an IND or IND-equivalent for authorization to initiate human clinical trials with ALPN-202 in the fourth quarter of 2019. We have not yet determined which cancer indication or indications we will investigate first.

Other Research Programs
In addition to our ALPN-101 and ALPN-202 programs, we have a number of other research efforts underway to address cancer and inflammatory diseases. We highlight two below: our programs to enhance ECTs and our V-mAb program.
Enhancement of Engineered Cellular Therapies 
ECTs in the form of CAR-T, engineered TCR-T, and engineered TILS have emerged as therapies with the potential to provide dramatic improvements in outcomes in certain cancer indications. In 2017, two CAR-T therapies were approved by the FDA (Kymriah (Novartis AG), and Yescarta (Kite Pharma, Inc.)). Despite the positive results observed with these and other ECTs in select tumors, there may be an opportunity to enhance efficacy and expand the utility of ECTs in additional indications. 
Our cell therapy enhancement programs were created to improve ECTs by increasing T cell proliferation, persistence, and effector functions, including tumor killing. We have approached this by creating vIgD-based TIPs, switch or decoy TIPs, and SIPs (Figure 13). 
Figure 13
Examples of such approaches include:

• | TIP: expression of a costimulatory vIgD, such as a CD86 vIgD, on the surface of an ECT to provide additional costimulation in cis and/or trans;


• | Decoy TIP: expression of a checkpoint vIgD, such as a PD-1 vIgD, on the surface of an ECT in the absence of the normal inhibitory intracelluar domain, competing with checkpoint ligands in the tumor microenvironment, or TME;


• | Switch TIP: expression of a checkpoint vIgD, such as a PD-1 vIgD, on the surface of an ECT in association with an activating intracellular domain, turning a checkpoint signal into a T cell-activating signal; and


• | SIP: expression of a secreted checkpoint vIgD, such as a PD-L1 vIgD, by an ECT, competing with checkpoint ligands in the TME

We have observed encouraging in vitro data with such approaches, where vIgDs enhance the proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxicity of ECTs.
14

Transmembrane vIgD or TIP (Transmembrane Immunomodulatory Protein)
TIPs are engineered costimulatory ligands expressed on the cell surface of T cells to promote activation and survival of both endogenous and engineered therapeutic cells in the local tumor environment. We have engineered several molecules for use in ECTs, including proprietary CD86 vIgDs. In an in vitro HPV tumor model, expression of engineered CD86 vIgD TIPs in E6 TCR-engineered T cells resulted in superior HPV-specific tumor responses including T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity in comparison to TCR-alone and TCR with wild-type CD86 vIgDs (Figure 14).
Figure 14
V-mAb Program

Our V-mAb technology potentially allows delivering a vIgD into the tumor microenvironment, or TME, with a monoclonal antibody. A V-mAb is a vIgD joined with a monoclonal antibody, or mAb, recognizing a validated target (as depicted in Figure 15). Additionally, a V-mAb could potentially deliver a checkpoint inhibitor to the TME. Our V-mAbs use the targeting antibody to localize the vIgD to the TME or target tissue to potentially deliver specific, locally-active immuno-modulation.

Tumors thrive in environments of immune suppression. Immune cells have often been recruited to the TME, but are not responding correctly. In many cases, the T cells are recognizing antigen in the form of MHC peptide, but this signal is not supported by required costimulatory activity. In these cases, T cells could benefit from tumor or APC expression of costimulatory ligands such as CD80, CD86, or ICOSL. This strategy could potentially invigorate tumor immune responses in a tumor-specific context.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to create modern therapies targeting the immune synapse, using our directed-evolution based scientific platform to treat patients with serious conditions such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. To achieve our goals, we intend to:
Aggressively move our lead inflammation/autoimmune therapeutic ALPN-101 through clinical development for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
ALPN-101 is an ICOS/CD28 dual antagonist based on the discovery, using our scientific platform, of a single vIgD with increased binding affinity for both ICOS and CD28. ALPN-101 has demonstrated activity in vitro and in vivo in multiple models of inflammatory diseases. In January 2019, we initiated dosing in a Phase I trial of ALPN-101 in healthy volunteers. We anticipate using the data from this study to begin one or more proof-of-concept Phase II studies in inflammatory diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis and GvHD, and expect to present data from the AIS-A01 clinical trial at a conference in 2020.
Aggressively move our lead oncology program ALPN-202 to clinical trials.
ALPN-202 is designed to antagonize PD-L1 and CTLA-4, while also providing PD-L1 dependent CD28 agonism. ALPN-202 is thus potentially capable of blocking inhibitory signals from PD-L1 and CTLA-4 while providing CD28 costimulation, thereby removing the brake and pressing the gas on the immune system to treat cancer. The ALPN-202 program is based on the discovery, using directed evolution and our scientific platform, of a single domain capable of interacting with PD-L1, CD28, and CTLA-4. ALPN-202 has demonstrated in vivo activity in mouse models of PD-L1 positive tumors. Our goal is to file an IND or IND-equivalent for authorization to initiate human clinical trials with ALPN-202 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Maximize the value of our pipeline and platform via partnering activities.
We believe our scientific platform is highly productive, with affinity maturation campaigns potentially capable of producing dozens of vIgDs with desirable biologic activity. Our discovery efforts to date have resulted in vIgDs with potential uses in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We believe this provides significant opportunity for partnering discussions. Our first such collaboration, with Kite Pharma, a Gilead company, involved two targets for use in ECTs and provided us $5.5 million in cash as well as up to $530.0 million in potential developmental, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments. While difficult to predict the timing of such partnerships or whether we will be successful in our efforts to enter into further collaborations, we are continually in discussions with multiple potential partners ranging from small biotechnology firms to large pharmaceutical companies.

Product Pipeline
We have a diverse pipeline of potentially novel therapies as shown in Figure 16 below. In January 2019, we started the Phase I healthy volunteer trial for ALPN-101 . 
Figure 16
Manufacturing
We have established in-house non-cGMP recombinant protein generation capabilities enabling our scientific platform, including validation of new scientific discoveries in vitro and in vivo. Having protein production capabilities in-house allows more rapid progression for vIgDs generated by our scientific platform.
To date, our lead programs have been accomplished through standard protein production and purification methods. As noted above, we believe one advantage of our scientific platform is selection outputs are generally manufacturable. Because the directed evolution process itself requires some level of protein production, campaigns often select for proteins readily expressed with favorable biochemical properties. We produce our vIgDs and vIgD-Fc constructs in mammalian cell lines using both HEK293 and CHO cell expression systems in our in-house protein production processes.
We have successfully completed a cGMP manufacturing campaign for ALPN-101 and have produced sufficient quantities of drug product necessary to execute initial human clinical trials. The upstream and downstream manufacturing processes for ALPN-101 use unit operations amenable to further scale-up to support later stage clinical trials and commercial production. GMP scale-up for ALPN-202 is ongoing, and on track to facilitate our goal to file an IND or IND-equivalent for authorization to initiate human clinical trials with ALPN-202 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
We have not yet manufactured any of our proteins at commercial scale. Abatacept is a wild-type IgSF protein commercially approved for multiple indications with no publicly-reported manufacturing difficulties. Belatacept is an IgSF protein with two mutations, likewise approved in multiple countries. We believe these two examples are potentially similar (in manufacturing terms) to our vIgD-based products.
We have chosen U.S.-based contract drug substance and drug product manufacturers for our initial clinical trial supplies of ALPN-101 and ALPN-202. We believe these contract manufacturers’ particular expertise in protein production, analytical development and fill/finish provide us with the capability to meet rapid timelines encompassing the development of production cell-lines to manufacturing of clinical trial quantities of the biopharmaceutical product.
Competition
We participate in the highly competitive sector of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals and in the subsector of immune modulation. This subsector has undergone tremendous technological advancement over the last decade due to advancements in understanding the role of the immune system across multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammatory disease. While we believe our novel technology platform, discovery programs, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources offer 
17

competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, public and private research institutions, and others.
Any products we successfully develop and commercialize will face competition from currently approved therapies and new therapies potentially available in the future.
The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies we compete against may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruitment and retention of qualified scientific and management personnel; recruitment of investigative sites and participants for clinical trials; and the acquisition of technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Specifically, our competitors include companies developing therapies with the same target(s) as ALPN-101 in inflammatory diseases and ALPN-202 in oncology as well as companies building novel platforms to generate multi-specific antibody or non-antibody-based targeting proteins.
See the risk factor “We face competition from entities that have developed or may develop therapeutic candidates for our target disease indications, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms based on modalities and technology similar to us. If these companies develop technologies or therapeutic candidates more rapidly than we do, or their technologies, including delivery technologies, are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize therapeutic candidates may be adversely affected” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for more discussion of the effects of competition and competitors on our business.

Intellectual Property
Our scientific platform and substantially all our intellectual property have been developed internally. As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consists of over 60 pending patent applications. Our initial patent application is directed to our scientific platform itself. Our second patent application is directed to the TIP program. We filed subsequent patent applications directed to our SIP program as well as to various target domains under development. To date, some of these applications have published but none have yet matured into granted patents. Each of these patent applications is solely owned by us. As we continue the development of our scientific platform and target vIgDs, we intend to continue pursuing intellectual property protection for these technologies.
We have in-licensed some intellectual property and trade secret materials on a non-exclusive basis. To date, such non-exclusive in-licenses are solely related to commercially-available cell lines involved in the manufacture of our vIgD programs. To date, no other intellectual property related to our scientific platform has been in-licensed.  We have out-licensed two programs under our TIP technology to Kite on an exclusive basis. No other out-licenses have been made.
19

Although we do not believe our technology infringes any intellectual property rights owned by third parties, we are aware of one or more patents and patent applications that may relate to our technology. Third parties may assert claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights regardless of whether their allegations have merit. Allegations of infringement could harm our reputation, may result in the expenditure of significant resources to defend and resolve such allegations, and could require us to pay monetary damages if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of therapeutic candidates. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of therapeutic candidates and products.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices, and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our potential therapeutic candidates and products will be subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the U.S. None of our therapeutic candidates have been approved by the FDA for marketing in the U.S., and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before biologic therapeutic candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale, or shipment of the therapeutic product.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain any approvals for our therapeutic candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Once a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of protein chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. Currently, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. We have commenced only one clinical trial for any of our current therapeutic candidates, the AIS-A01 dosing study of ALPN-101 in healthy volunteers beginning in January 2019.
20

Clinical trials involve the administration of the therapeutic candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. For each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial, an institutional review board, or IRB, must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice requirements, including the requirements for informed consent.
All clinical research performed in the U.S. in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.
Clinical Trials
For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the therapeutic candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the therapeutic candidate for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study, evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, determine a dosage schedule, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.


• | Phase III clinical trials are commonly definitive efficacy studies of the experimental medication. Phase III trials are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate a dose range of the therapeutic candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase III clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the therapeutic candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate the therapeutic candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Biologics License Applications
The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the chemistry, pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and the clinical effects of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a biologic is safe, pure, and potent and whether the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
21

Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA will review the application and respond to the applicant, but the review process may be significantly delayed by FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA evaluates a standard original BLA submission within the first 60 days of its receipt to determine if it is sufficiently complete to conduct a full review, and the FDA has a goal of responding to the submission within ten months of the 60-day filing date, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and/or recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or for any reason, or it may require additional clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the biologic reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such biologic or require a recall of any biologic already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
A sponsor may also seek approval of its therapeutic candidates under programs designed to accelerate FDA review and approval of BLAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a therapeutic candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments, under the FDA’s accelerated approval program. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval confirmatory clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint.
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a new category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be subject to accelerated approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
Therapeutic candidates may also be eligible for “priority review,” or review within a six-month timeframe from the 60-day filing date, if a sponsor provides sufficient clinical data demonstrating its therapeutic candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed products. Even if a therapeutic candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide the therapeutic candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation and/or accelerated approval for our biologics. We cannot predict whether any of our therapeutic candidates will obtain a fast track and/or accelerated approval designation and, if so, whether such designation will be maintained or rescinded by FDA, or the ultimate impact, if any, of the fast track or the accelerated approval process on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of our proposed biologics.
Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes, equipment, or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance and will not approve the biologic unless compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements is satisfactory.
22

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our therapeutic candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing our therapeutic candidates. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals restricting the commercial application of the products. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, change in personnel, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement which may require additional studies to evaluate the effect of such change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product—must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. As with new BLAs, the review process for BLA supplements may be delayed by the FDA through requests for additional information or clarification.
We believe any of our therapeutic products approved as a biological product under a BLA might qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity currently permitted by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. Specifically, the BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted by an applicant until four years after the date the reference product was first licensed and cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was first licensed under a BLA. There is a risk the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period or the FDA will not consider our therapeutic candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and the courts. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes operating to limit the scope or length of exclusivity afforded by the BPCIA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products or for abbreviated pathways for follow on biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity.
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a therapeutic candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that therapeutic candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic for that particular rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. If a therapeutic candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the therapeutic candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same therapeutic candidate as defined by the FDA or if our therapeutic candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s therapeutic candidate for the same indication or disease.
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a “Written Request,” relating to the use of the active moiety of the therapeutic candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines information relating to the use of a therapeutic candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for 
23

which the therapeutic candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. Our company cannot be certain it or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If our company or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA for the therapeutic product.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses not described in the product’s labeling and different from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we refer to as the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, and fraud and abuse, impacting existing government healthcare programs and resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives, and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. The Affordable Care Act also does, among other things, the following:

• | Increases pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program due to an increase in the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs, and the application of Medicaid rebate liability to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans.


• | Expands the 340B Drug Pricing Program to require discounts for “covered outpatient drugs” sold to certain children’s hospitals, critical access hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospital.


• | Requires pharmaceutical companies to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the “Donut Hole.”


• | Requires pharmaceutical companies to pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on each company’s market share of prior year total sales of branded drugs to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense.


• | Establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.

• | Establishes The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the sale, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by the CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways significantly affecting our business and our products.
In particular, we expect the Administration and Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the U.S. healthcare reform legislation. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the ACA. President Trump has also issued an executive order in which he stated it is his Administration’s policy to seek the repeal of the ACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s Administration and Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop therapeutic candidates. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on our company.
Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform health care coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care benefits, controls on health care spending, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for, or the amounts federal and state governments will pay for, health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures, and limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the federal Medicaid program, a program for financially needy patients, among others, requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.
In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B, part of the federal Medicare program covering outpatient items and services for the aged and disabled, and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program, a federal program requiring manufacturers to provide discounts to certain safety-net providers. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based upon certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics reported by the manufacturer.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. However, under Medicare Part D - Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit - there are protections in place to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oncology products and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all anti-cancer agents. Furthermore, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
25

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product approved for sale, we may need to pursue compendia listings or conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing strategies. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws affecting our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;


• | provisions of HIPAA, prohibiting knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program and making false statements relating to health care matters;


• | provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act, requiring manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, which information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website; and


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides the government may assert a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Facilities
We lease a facility containing our research and development, laboratory, and office space, which consists of approximately 11,158 square feet located at 201 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, Washington. In January 2018, we entered into a lease amendment for approximately 6,184 square feet of additional office and laboratory space adjacent to our existing leased premises in Seattle, Washington. The lease expires on December 31, 2019 and has two options to extend the lease term with each option enabling us to extend the lease term by twelve months. In March 2019, we entered into a lease for 27,164 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 188 East Blaine Street, Seattle, Washington which we expect to occupy prior to the expiration of our current lease. See Part I, Item 2 of this report for more details on the terms of the lease. We believe that our existing facilities and the facilities we intend to occupy prior to the expiration of our current lease are adequate to meet our business requirements for the near-term and that additional space will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if required.
