Item 1.    Business.
General
We are engaged primarily in two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts.
As of December 30, 2021, our theatre operations included 85 movie theatres with 1,064 screens throughout 17 states (Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia). We also operate a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, that is adjacent to one of our theatres in Appleton, Wisconsin. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are the 4th largest theatre circuit in the United States.
As of December 30, 2021, our hotels and resorts operations included eight wholly-owned or majority-owned and operated hotels and resorts in Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska and Oklahoma. We also managed 11 hotels, resorts and other properties for third parties in Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Texas. As of December 30, 2021, we owned or managed approximately 5,400 hotel and resort rooms.
Both of these business segments are discussed in detail below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income or loss, assets and certain other financial information of these segments for the last three full fiscal years, please see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Note 14 in Part II below.
Strategic Plans
Please see our discussion under “Current Plans” in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Theatre Operations
At the end of fiscal 2021, we owned or operated 85 movie theatre locations with a total of 1,064 screens in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. We averaged 12.5 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 12.3 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2020 and 12.2 screens per location at the end of fiscal 2019. Our 85 company-owned facilities include 50 megaplex theatres (12 or more screens), representing approximately 70% of our total screens, 34 multiplex theatres (two to 11 screens) and one single-screen theatre.
We invested approximately $379 million, excluding acquisitions, to further enhance the movie-going experience and amenities in new and existing theatres over the last eight-plus years. These investments include:
New theatres. In October 2019, we opened our new eight-screen Movie Tavern® by Marcus theatre in Brookfield, Wisconsin. This new theatre became the first Movie Tavern by Marcus in Wisconsin. It includes eight auditoriums, each with laser projection and comfortable DreamLoungerSM recliner seating, a full-service bar and food and drink center, and a new delivery-to-seat service model that also allows guests to order food and beverage via our mobile phone application or in-theatre kiosk. We will consider additional sites for potential new theatre locations in both new and existing markets in the future. 
Theatre acquisitions. In addition to building new theatres, acquisitions of existing theatres or theatre circuits has also been a viable growth strategy for us. On February 1, 2019, we acquired the assets of Movie Tavern®, a New Orleans-based industry leading circuit known for its in-theatre dining concept featuring chef-driven menus, premium quality food and drink and luxury seating. Now branded Movie Tavern by Marcus, the acquired circuit consisted of 208 screens at 22 locations in nine states – Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. The purchase price consisted of $30 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and 2,450,000 shares of our common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $139.3 million, based upon our closing share price on January 31, 2019. The acquisition of the Movie Tavern circuit increased our total number of screens by an additional 23%.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in another challenging year for all theatre operators. A number of theatre operators have filed for bankruptcy relief and many others continue to face difficult financial circumstances. Although we will prioritize our own finances, we will continue to consider potential acquisitions as well as consider management agreements which may possibly lead to opportunities to own. The movie theatre industry is very fragmented, with approximately 50% of United States screens owned by the three largest theatre circuits and the other 50% owned by an estimated 800 smaller operators, making it very difficult to predict when acquisition opportunities may arise. We do not believe that we are geographically constrained, and we believe that we may be able to add value to certain theatres through our various proprietary amenities and operating expertise.
DreamLounger recliner additions. These luxurious, state-of-the-art recliners allow guests to go from upright to a full-recline position in seconds. These seat changes require full auditorium remodels to accommodate the necessary 84 inches of legroom, resulting in the loss of approximately 50% of the existing traditional seats in an average auditorium. To date, the addition of DreamLoungers has increased attendance at each of our applicable theatres, outperforming nearby competitive theatres and growing the overall market attendance in most cases. Initially, 12 of the 22 acquired Movie Tavern theatres had recliner seating. We added DreamLounger recliner seats to four additional existing Movie Tavern theatres during fiscal 2019, as well as one Marcus Wehrenberg® theatre and one newly built Movie Tavern theatre. We completed the addition of DreamLounger recliner seats at two additional Movie Tavern locations during fiscal 2020 and added DreamLounger recliner seats to one Marcus Wehrenberg theatre in fiscal 2021. As of December 30, 2021, we offered all DreamLounger recliner seating in 66 theatres, representing approximately 78% of our theatres. Including our premium, large format (PLF) auditoriums with recliner seating, as of December 30, 2021, we offered our DreamLounger recliner seating in approximately 81% of our screens, a percentage we believe to be the highest among the largest theatre chains in the nation.
UltraScreen DLX® and SuperScreen DLX® (DreamLounger eXperience) conversions. We introduced one of the first PLF presentations to the industry when we rolled out our proprietary UltraScreen® concept over 20 years ago. We later introduced our UltraScreen DLX concept by combining our premium, large-format presentation with DreamLounger recliner seating and Dolby® Atmos™ immersive sound to elevate the movie-going experience for our guests. During fiscal 2019, we opened one new UltraScreen DLX at an existing Marcus Wehrenberg theatre and converted one existing screen into an UltraScreen DLX auditorium at a Movie Tavern by Marcus theatre. During fiscal 2019, we also converted 28 existing screens at 15 Movie Tavern by Marcus theatres and two existing screens at one Marcus Wehrenberg theatre to SuperScreen DLX and opened one new SuperScreen DLX auditorium at a newly built Movie Tavern by Marcus theatre. During fiscal 2020, we converted two existing screens at two Movie Tavern by Marcus theatres and one existing screen at one Marcus Wehrenberg theatre to SuperScreen DLX auditoriums. Most of our PLF screens now include the added feature of heated DreamLounger recliner seats. As of December 30, 2021, we had 31 UltraScreen DLX auditoriums, one traditional UltraScreen auditorium, 85 SuperScreen DLX auditoriums (a slightly smaller screen than an UltraScreen but with the same DreamLounger seating and Dolby Atmos sound) and three IMAX® PLF screens at 66 of our theatre locations. As of December 30, 2021, we offered at least one PLF screen in approximately 78% of our theatres – once again a percentage we believe to be the highest percentage among the largest theatre chains in the nation. Our PLF screens generally have higher per-screen revenues and draw customers from a larger geographic region compared to our standard screens, and we charge a premium price to our guests for this experience. We continue to evaluate opportunities to convert additional existing screens to SuperScreen DLX auditoriums.
Signature cocktail and dining concepts. We have continued to further enhance our food and beverage offerings within our existing theatres. We believe our 50-plus years of food and beverage experience in the hotel and restaurant businesses provides us with a unique advantage and expertise that we can leverage to further grow revenues in our theatres. The concepts we are expanding include:
•Take FiveSM Lounge, Take Five Express and The Tavern – These full-service bars offer an inviting atmosphere and a chef-inspired dining menu, along with a complete selection of cocktails, locally-brewed beers and wines. We also offer full liquor service through the concession stand at two theatres. We acquired 22 new bars, known as The Tavern, in conjunction with our Movie Tavern acquisition and opened an additional Tavern at our new Brookfield, Wisconsin Movie Tavern by Marcus theatre in fiscal 2019. We closed three Movie Tavern by Marcus theatres in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. As of December 30, 2021, we offered bars/full liquor service at 49 theatres, representing approximately 58% of our theatres. We are currently evaluating opportunities to add bar service to additional locations.
•Zaffiro’s® Express – These outlets offer lobby dining that includes appetizers, sandwiches, salads, desserts and our signature Zaffiro’s THINCREDIBLE® handmade thin-crust pizza. In select locations without a Take Five Lounge outlet, we offer beer and wine at the Zaffiro’s Express outlet. We opened one new Zaffiro’s Express outlet during fiscal 2019 at our new Movie Tavern by Marcus location in Brookfield, Wisconsin, and our number of theatres with this concept totaled 29 as of December 30, 2021, representing approximately 45% of our theatres (excluding our in-theatre dining Movie Tavern theatres). We also operate three Zaffiro’s® Pizzeria and Bar full-service restaurants.
•Reel Sizzle® – This signature dining concept serves menu items inspired by classic Hollywood and the iconic diners of the 1950s. We offer Americana fare like burgers and chicken sandwiches prepared on a griddle 
behind the counter, along with chicken tenders, crinkle-cut fries, ice cream and signature shakes. Our new Movie Tavern by Marcus in Brookfield, Wisconsin includes a Real Sizzle. We added one Reel Sizzle outlet in fiscal 2021 to a Marcus Wehrenberg theatre that underwent a complete renovation. As of December 30, 2021, we operated nine Reel Sizzle outlets.
•Other in-lobby dining – We also operate one Hollywood Café at an existing theatre, and three of the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres offer in-lobby dining concepts sold through the concession stand. In addition, we have one Mexican food concept at one theatre, and we are considering expanding this new concept in the future. Including these additional concepts, as of December 30, 2021, we offered one or more in-lobby dining concepts in 39 theatres, representing approximately 60% of our theatres (excluding our in-theatre dining Movie Tavern theatres).
•In-theatre dining – As of December 30, 2021, we offered in-theatre dining with a complete menu of drinks and chef-prepared salads, sandwiches, entrées and desserts at 29 theatres and a total of 229 auditoriums, operating under the names Big Screen BistroSM, Big Screen Bistro ExpressSM, BistroPlexSM and Movie Tavern by Marcus, representing approximately 34% of our theatres.
We offer a “$5 Tuesday” promotion at every theatre in our circuit that includes a free complimentary-size popcorn to our loyalty program members. We have seen our Tuesday attendance increase dramatically since the introduction of the $5 Tuesday promotion. We believe this promotion has increased movie-going frequency and reached a customer who may have stopped going to the movies because of price, creating another “weekend” day for us without adversely impacting the movie-going habits of our regular weekend customers. We introduced our $5 Tuesday promotion with the free popcorn for loyalty members at our Marcus Wehrenberg theatres immediately upon acquisition in December 2016 and did the same thing in February 2019 with our newly acquired Movie Tavern theatres. We experienced an increase in Tuesday performance at the Marcus Wehrenberg theatres and have seen a similar response from customers at our Movie Tavern theatres. We also offer a “$6 Student Thursday” promotion at all of our locations that has been well received by that particular customer segment. In addition, we offer a $6 “Young-at-Heart” program for seniors on Friday afternoons that was also introduced to our Movie Tavern locations during our fiscal 2019 first quarter.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced Marcus Private Cinema (“MPC”) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Under this program, a guest may purchase an entire auditorium for a fixed charge, ranging from $99 to $275 (depending upon the film and number of weeks it has been in theatres). Early on, sales attributable to our MPC program exceeded expectations, offsetting reduced traditional attendance. As new film content became available and as vaccines were rolled out and theatre comfort level improved, the demand for these dedicated shows has slowed. At its peak during the majority of the weeks during our fiscal 2021 first quarter, we averaged over 1,500 MPC events per week, accounting for approximately 21% of our admission revenues during those weeks. 
We offer what we believe to be a best-in-class customer loyalty program called Magical Movie RewardsSM. We currently have approximately 4.4 million members enrolled in the program. Approximately 41% of all box office transactions and 40% of total transactions in our theatres during fiscal 2021 were completed by registered members of the loyalty program. The program allows members to earn points for each dollar spent and access special offers available only to members. The rewards are redeemable at the box office, concession stand or at the many Marcus Theatres® food and beverage venues. In addition, we have partnered with Movio, a global leader in data analysis for the cinema industry, to allow more targeted communication with our loyalty members. The software provides us with insight into customer preferences, attendance habits and general demographics, which we believe will help us deliver customized communication to our members. In turn, members of this program can enjoy and plan for a more personalized movie-going experience. The program also gives us the ability to cost effectively promote non-traditional programming and special events, particularly during non-peak time periods. We believe that this will result in increased movie-going frequency, more frequent visits to the concession stand, increased loyalty to Marcus Theatres and ultimately, improved operating results. The acquired Movie Tavern theatres did not offer a loyalty program to their customers. We introduced our Magical Movie Rewards program to these theatres during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
We have recently enhanced our mobile ticketing capabilities, our downloadable Marcus Theatres mobile application, and our marcustheatres.com website. We added food and beverage ordering capabilities to our mobile application, including our recently opened Movie Tavern location in Brookfield, Wisconsin, in fiscal 2019 and expanded this feature to all of our theatres in fiscal 2020. We have continued to install additional theatre-level technology, such as new ticketing kiosks, digital menu boards and concession advertising monitors. Each of these enhancements is designed to improve customer interactions, both at the theatre and through mobile platforms and other electronic devices.
The addition of digital technology throughout our circuit (we offer digital cinema projection on 100% of our screens) has provided us with additional opportunities to obtain non-motion picture programming from other new and existing content providers, including live and pre-recorded performances of the Metropolitan Opera, as well as sports, music and other events, at many of our locations. We offer weekday and weekend alternate programming at many of our theatres across our circuit. This special programming includes classic movies, live performances, comedy shows and children’s performances. We believe this type of programming is more impactful when presented on the big screen and provides an opportunity to continue to expand our audience base beyond traditional moviegoers.
Revenues for the theatre business, and the motion picture industry in general, are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films, together with studio marketing, advertising and support campaigns, factors over which we have no control. Blockbusters have historically accounted for a significant portion of our total admission revenues – in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, our top 15 performing films accounted for 48% of our fiscal 2019 total admission revenues and 42% of our fiscal 2018 total admission revenues. With fewer films released during fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic, our top 15 films accounted for 55% of our fiscal 2021 total admission revenues.
We obtain our films from several national motion picture production and distribution companies, and we are not dependent on any single motion picture supplier. Our booking, advertising, concession purchases and promotional activities are handled centrally by our administrative staff.
We strive to provide our movie patrons with high-quality picture and sound presentation in clean, comfortable, safe, attractive and contemporary theatre environments. All of our movie theatre complexes feature digital cinema technology; either digital sound, Dolby or other stereo sound systems; acoustical ceilings; side wall insulation; engineered drapery folds to eliminate sound imbalance, reverberation and distortion; tiled floors; cup-holder chair-arms; and computer-controlled heating, air conditioning and ventilation. We offer stadium seating, a tiered seating system that permits unobstructed viewing, at substantially all of our screens. Computerized box offices permit all of our movie theatres to sell tickets in advance and all of our theatres offer reserved seating. Our theatres are accessible to persons with disabilities and provide wireless headphones for hearing-impaired moviegoers. Other amenities at certain theatres include touch-screen, computerized, self-service ticket kiosks, which simplify advance ticket purchases. We have an agreement to allow moviegoers to buy tickets on Fandango, the largest online ticket-seller, or directly through our website or app.
We have a master license agreement with a subsidiary of Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp. to deploy digital cinema systems in the majority of our theatre locations. Under the terms of the agreement, Cinedigm’s subsidiary purchased the digital projection systems and licensed them to us under a long-term arrangement. The costs to deploy this new technology are being covered primarily through the payment of virtual print fees from studios to our selected implementation company, Cinedigm. Our goals from digital cinema included delivering an improved film presentation to our guests, increasing scheduling flexibility, providing a platform for additional 3D presentations as needed, as well as maximizing the opportunities for alternate programming that may be available with this technology. As of December 30, 2021, we had the ability to offer digital 3D presentations in 353, or approximately 34%, of our screens, including the vast majority of our UltraScreens. We have the ability to increase the number of digital 3D capable screens we offer to our guests in the future as needed, based on the number of digital 3D films anticipated to be released during future periods and our customers’ response to these 3D releases.
We sell food and beverage concessions in all of our movie theatres. We believe that a wide variety of food and beverage items, properly merchandised, increases concession revenue per patron. Although popcorn and soda remain the traditional favorites with moviegoers, we continue to upgrade our available concessions by offering varied choices. For example, some of our theatres offer hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, pretzel bites, frozen yogurt, coffee, mineral water and juices. We have also added self-serve soft drink dispensers and grab-and-go candy, frozen treat and bottled drink kiosks to many of our theatres. In recent years, we have added signature cocktail and dining concepts as described above. The response to our new food and beverage offerings has been very positive, and we have plans to continue to expand these food and beverage concepts at additional locations in the future.
We have a variety of ancillary revenue sources in our theatres, with the largest related to the sale of pre-show and lobby advertising (through our current advertising providers, Screenvision and National CineMedia). We also obtain ancillary revenues from corporate and group meeting sales, sponsorships, internet surcharge fees and alternate auditorium uses. We continue to pursue additional strategies to increase our ancillary revenue sources, including the addition of a new post transaction click-through advertising agreement with Rokt during fiscal 2021.
We also own a family entertainment center, Funset Boulevard, adjacent to our 14-screen movie theatre in Appleton, Wisconsin. Funset Boulevard features a 40,000 square foot Hollywood-themed indoor amusement facility that includes a restaurant, party room, laser tag center, virtual reality games, arcade, outdoor miniature golf course and batting cages.

We own the SafeHouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin after purchasing it in 2015. SafeHouse is an iconic, spy-themed restaurant and bar that has operated in Milwaukee for over 55 years. We opened a new SafeHouse location in Chicago, Illinois in 2017 and also opened the EscapeHouse Chicago, a complimentary business capitalizing on the popularity of cooperative team escape games. SafeHouse Chicago and the EscapeHouse Chicago were closed during 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic, but are expected to be reopened in 2022.
Our Wisconsin Hospitality Linen Service (WHLS) business unit provides commercial laundry services for our hotel and resort properties in Wisconsin and for other unaffiliated hotels in the Midwest. WHLS processed nearly 16 million pounds of linen each year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHLS has been a leader in commercial laundry services for the hospitality industry in the Midwest for over 20 years.
We operate many award-winning restaurants and lounges within our hotel portfolio that have earned distinctions such as the TripAdvisor® Travelers’ Choice and the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence.
In 2019, we were one of ten nationwide recipients of the Americans for the Arts’ Arts and Business Partnership Award, which recognizes businesses for their exceptional involvement with the arts that enriches the workplace, enhances education and transforms communities.
Competition
Both of our businesses experience intense competition from national, regional and local chain and franchise operations, some of which have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Most of our facilities are located in close proximity to competing facilities.
Our movie theatres compete with large national movie theatre operators, such as AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Regal Cinemas, as well as with a wide array of smaller first-run exhibitors. Movie exhibitors also faced increased competition during the pandemic from a number of other movie exhibition delivery systems, such as streaming services, premium video-on-demand (PVOD), digital downloads, video-on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs and network and syndicated television. We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income.
While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on our industry, customer confidence surveys improved during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. As an industry, we continue to promote “The Big Screen is Back” campaign that was launched at the end April 2021 by the National Association of Theatre Owners and the Motion Picture Association of America in an effort of welcoming and encouraging Americans back to the theatre.
Our hotels and resorts compete with the hotels and resorts operated and/or franchised by Hyatt Corporation, Marriott Corporation, Hilton Worldwide and others, along with other regional and local hotels and resorts. Increasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry, such as peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb, Vrbo and HomeAway. We compete for hotel management agreements with a wide variety of national, regional and local management companies based upon many factors, including the value and quality of our management services, our reputation, our ability and willingness to invest our capital in joint venture projects, the level of our management fees and our relationships with property owners and investors.
We believe that the principal factors of competition in both of our businesses, in varying degrees, are the price and quality of the product, quality and location of our facilities and customer service. We believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of these factors.
Seasonality
Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our first fiscal quarter typically produces the weakest operating results in our hotels and resorts division due primarily to the effects of reduced travel during the winter months. Our second and third fiscal quarters often produce our strongest operating results because these periods coincide with the typical 
summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength of the lodging business. Due to the fact that the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve is historically one of the strongest weeks of the year for our theatre division, the specific timing of the last Thursday in December has an impact on the results of our fiscal first and fourth quarters in that division, particularly when we have a 53-week year.
Environmental Regulation
Federal, state and local environmental legislation has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, our activities in acquiring and selling real estate for business development purposes have been complicated by the continued emphasis that our personnel must place on properly analyzing real estate sites for potential environmental problems. This circumstance has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, greater time and increased costs involved in acquiring and selling properties associated with our various businesses.
Human Capital
As of December 30, 2021, we had approximately 7,500 employees, approximately 61% of whom were employed on a variable or part-time basis. A number of our associates at The Pfister Hotel and the Hilton Milwaukee City Center are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expired on February 14, 2022 and February 29, 2022 which are currently being negotiated, and collective bargaining agreements that expire on May 31, 2022 and December 31, 2022. As of the end of fiscal 2021, approximately 9% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, of which approximately 98% were covered by an agreement that will expire before December 31, 2022.
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. Management also reviews employee engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor employee morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry.
We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination.
During fiscal 2020 and 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented heightened safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees and our customers. These protocols included complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification as well, including portions of our workforce working remotely when appropriate.
