ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
​
In this annual report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, “Vista”, “Vista Gold”, or the “Company” refer to Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries. References to AUD or A$ refer to Australian currency and USD or $ refer to United States currency, all in thousands, unless specified otherwise, except per share-related, per tonne, and per ounce amounts. 
​
Overview
​
Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries operate in the gold mining industry. We are focused on evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements with other mining companies, or outright sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration. We look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and/or technical studies focused on optimizing previous engineering work. We do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations.
​
The Company’s flagship asset is its 100% owned Mt Todd gold project (“Mt Todd” or the “Project”) in Northern Territory, Australia (“NT”). With the approval of the Mining Management Plan (“MMP”) in June 2021, all major operating and environmental permits for Mt Todd have been received. Mt Todd is the largest undeveloped gold project in Australia.
​
Vista recently completed the Mt Todd Feasibility Study (“2022 FS”), which is highlighted by:


● | Estimated proven and probable mineral reserves of 6.98 Moz of gold (280 Mt at 0.77 g Au/t) using a gold price of $1,125 for the reserve estimate and a cut-off grade of 0.35 g Au/t(1)(2);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Average annual production of 395,000 ounces of gold over a 16-year mine life;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Life of Mine average cash costs of $817 per ounce;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Initial capital requirements of $892 million, which assume an owner-operated mining fleet, power generated on-site by a third-party, and a locally based employee workforce;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After-tax NPV5% of $999.5 million and internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 20.6% at a gold price of $1,600 per ounce; and

​
We have invested over $105 million to systematically explore, evaluate, engineer, permit and de-risk Mt Todd since we acquired it in 2006. In recent years, we have completed a number of optimization studies, which have been incorporated into the 2022 FS. This work has added substantial value to the Project and positions Mt Todd for near-term development. We believe the results will appeal to potential partners, investors and lenders and allow us to evaluate a range of development alternatives as we continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value in a cost-effective manner.
​
The 2022 FS includes reserve estimates pursuant to subpart 1300 of Regulations S-K (“S-K 1300”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and CIM Definition Standards based on mine plans developed using a gold price in line with current market conditions. The 2022 FS addresses recommendations from the 2019 pre-feasibility study and includes minor updates of the Project design to be consistent with the MMP, engineering and detailed costing in all areas of the Project.
​
The 2022 FS highlights a 19% increase in gold reserves from 5.85 million ounces to 6.98 million ounces, supporting an operation with average annual production of 479,000 ounces of gold during the first seven years of commercial operations 



and a low operating cost profile that delivers significant cashflows over a 16-year mine life. The 2022 FS reflects the inflationary pressures being faced currently by all operators in the mining industry. While management believes this inflationary trend is transitory, the resilience of Mt Todd is demonstrated by the project economics reflected in the 2022 FS. Mt Todd’s attributes, together with Vista’s deep understanding of the various project components create optionality in the approach to its development. For example, the Company decision to have a third-party build, own, and operate the power plant has resulted in capital cost savings and eliminated certain construction and operating risks while retaining attractive operating costs. 
​
We believe this work has added substantially to the value of the Project, which reflects a $1.5 billion net present value (NPV5%) at the recent gold price of $1,800 per ounce and a 0.71 AUD:USD exchange rate and demonstrates near-term development potential. See the “Item 2. Properties – Gold Price and Foreign Exchange Sensitivity Table” below.
​
Resources and reserves growth potential at Mt Todd includes a number of opportunities. There is potential to convert additional known mineral resources to mineral reserves, and both the Batman and Quigleys deposits remain open. Recent drilling demonstrates the continuity of mineralization between these two deposits, and Vista controls 1,650 sq. km of exploration licenses at the southeast end of the Pine Creek Mining District.
​
In addition to the technical advancements of the Project, with the recent approval of the MMP, Vista now has all major operating and environmental permits for the development of Mt Todd. We have invested significant resources in water treatment and management, environmental, and social programs. We believe this has benefited our relationships with the traditional landowners, local communities, and NT Government, creating a strong social license.
​
Vista has successfully monetized a number of non-core assets to support continuing operations in a non-dilutive manner. This includes cash proceeds to the Company totaling $14,090 during 2020, 2021 and January 2022. The Company continues to focus on monetizing a royalty interest in a U.S. exploration-stage project and used mill equipment.
​
Vista was originally incorporated on November 28, 1983 under the name “Granges Exploration Ltd.” It amalgamated with Pecos Resources Ltd. during June 1985 and continued as Granges Exploration Ltd. In June 1989, Granges Exploration Ltd. changed its name to Granges Inc. Granges Inc. amalgamated with Hycroft Resources & Development Corporation during May 1995 and continued as Granges Inc. Effective November 1996, Da Capo Resources Ltd. and Granges, Inc. amalgamated under the name “Vista Gold Corp.” and, effective December 1997, Vista continued from the Province of British Columbia to the Yukon Territory, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon Territory). On June 11, 2013, Vista continued from the Yukon Territory, Canada to the Province of British Columbia, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

​
Human Capital Management
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 17 full-time and no part-time employees globally. In addition, we use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of our corporate affairs, project evaluation, due diligence, corporate governance and property management. 
​
Our compensation programs are designed to align compensation of our employees with Vista’s corporate objectives and performance, and are designed to provide proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances competitive wages, benefits and incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance.
​
The health and safety of our employees and others is a high priority in the way we manage our business. Oversight is provided by the Company’s Board of Directors through the Health, Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility 




Committee. Management utilizes the principles set out in our Health & Safety Policy to administer health and safety programs. Employees and others entering our workplaces are provided with relevant orientation and required to adhere to established site protocols. In addition to recurring health and safety considerations, we follow COVID-19 mitigation measures recommended by government and health agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate.
​
Vista’s priority to maintain a culture of ethical performance as a core value is reflected in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other related policies. Oversight is provided by the Company’s Board of Directors and, for specific areas of performance, by committees of the Board of Directors. Employees are required to review the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and acknowledge their understanding of the content and intent to comply on a periodic basis. Our compensation programs also include consideration of ethical performance in determining incentive awards.
​
Vista values the diversity and talents of its team, collectively working together in an inclusive environment to achieve corporate goals and personal and professional development objectives. We cultivate a culture that is sensitive to the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace and are committed to continuous improvement in these areas.
​
Environmental, Social, and Governance Responsibility
​
Vista is committed to implementing and continuing to develop business practices that are designed to mitigate environmental impacts of our operating activities, support the people and communities within our areas of influence, and appropriately manage the business affairs of our organization. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how we affect the environment and fulfill our responsibilities to stakeholders. In particular, through our planning for development of Mt Todd, we have worked closely with governmental entities in the NT and local groups, including the Jawoyn Association Aboriginal Corporation (the “Jawoyn”), to strive towards an environmentally sound and socially responsible development plan.
​
Segment Information
​
We have one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Australia. We evaluate, acquire, explore and advance gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements, or outright sales of assets. We reported no mining operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Notes 4 – Mineral Properties and 5 – Plant and Equipment to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.
​
Reclamation
​
The Mt Todd site was not reclaimed by the predecessor owners when the mine closed in 2000. Liability for the reclamation of the environmental conditions existing prior to the 2006 commencement of Vista’s involvement with the Project is presently the responsibility of the NT Government. After it provides notice to the NT Government that it intends to proceed with development, the Company will then assume these historical rehabilitation liabilities currently estimated by the NT Government at approximately A$73 million. Vista does not expect to give such notice until a project development decision has been made, major project permits are confirmed to be in alignment with the final development plan, and project financing is arranged.
​
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts, including any of those existing prior to 2006 that are not otherwise mitigated during the mine life, by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of the Project after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. Reclamation programs will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
​
Additionally, Vista maintains a $240 provision for potential reclamation costs attributable to certain mining claims previously held by the Company should no other viable potentially responsible parties be identified.
​



Government Regulation
​
Our exploration and development activities and other property interests are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in Australia and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, mine safety, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, the use and disposal of hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained all major authorizations and have pending applications for other minor licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration, development, and other programs. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
​
Australian Laws 
 ​
Mineral projects in the NT are subject to Australian federal and NT laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and the use and disposal of hazardous wastes and materials. As with all mining projects, Mt Todd is expected to have a variety of environmental impacts should development proceed. In Australia, environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry. We are required under Australian laws and regulations (federal and territorial) to acquire permits and other authorizations before Mt Todd can be developed and mined. In September 2014, the environmental impact statement (“EIS”) for Mt Todd was approved. The Environmental Protection Agency of the Northern Territory Government (“NTEPA”) advised that it had assessed the environmental impacts of the proposed gold mine at Mt Todd and authorized the Company to proceed with development, subject to a number of recommendations as outlined in the assessment report (the “Assessment Report”). The Assessment Report included a request for Vista to secure an authorization under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (“EPBC”) as it relates to the Gouldian Finch. In January 2018, the authorization required by the EPBC was approved by the Australia Department of the Environment and Energy. We must comply with the terms of our Authority Certificate under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 which deals with the handling of archeological material and sacred sites. We are also subject to statutory requirements under the Mining Management Act, which includes the requirement to receive authorization of an MMP before the start of mining operations. The Mt Todd MMP was approved by the Northern Territory Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade (“DITT”) in June 2021 and will be amended to align with the larger-scale design in the 2022 FS.
​
Environmental Regulation
​
Mt Todd is subject to various federal, territorial and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
​
Changes to current local, territorial, or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we have exploration and development activities could require additional capital expenditures and increase operating and/or reclamation costs. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, or what additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of Mt Todd.
​
During 2021, Mt Todd did not have any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental laws and regulations. See “Item 1. Business – Reclamation” above.
​
Competition
​
We compete with other mining companies to acquire, explore, finance and develop gold properties and to retain expert consultants required to complete our geological and project development studies. We also compete with other mining companies to hire mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry, and for exploration and development services. Some of these competing mining companies have substantially greater financial and technical resources than Vista. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices, engaging skilled consultants, and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
​



Gold Price History
​
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold supply and demand, and political and economic conditions.

Glossary
​
“acid rock drainage” results from the interaction of meteoric water with oxidizing sulfide minerals.
​
“bedding” means the characteristic structure of sedimentary rock in which layers of different composition, grain size or arrangement are layered one on top of another in a sequence with oldest on the bottom and youngest at the top. 
​
“comminution” means the process in which ore is broken into small fragments by crushing, grinding, and other processes. 
​
“conglomerate” refers to clastic sedimentary rock that contains rounded particles that are greater than two millimeters in diameter. The space between the pebbles is generally filled with smaller particles and/or a chemical cement that binds the rock together. 
​
“cut-off grade” means the grade (i.e., the concentration of metal or mineral in rock) that determines whether mined mineralized material will be processed or considered waste.
​
“deposit” is an informal term for an accumulation of mineralized material.




​
“development stage issuer” is an issuer that is engaged in the preparation of mineral reserves for extraction on at least one material property.
​
“development stage property” is a property that has mineral reserves disclosed, pursuant to S-K 1300, but no material extraction.
​
“feasibility study” is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project that includes appropriately detailed assessments of realistically assumed mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental considerations together with any other relevant operational factors and detailed financial analysis, that are necessary to demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction is reasonably justified or economically viable. The results of a feasibility study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of a project. The confidence level of a feasibility study is higher than that of a preliminary feasibility study.
​
“foliation” means planar arrangement of structural or textural features in any rock type.
​
“g Au/t” means grams of gold per tonne. 
​
“geosyncline” means a major trough or downwarp of the Earth’s crust, in which great thicknesses of sedimentary and/or volcanic rocks have accumulated. 
​
“indicated mineral resource” and “indicated resource” mean “indicated mineral resource” defined by S-K 1300 as that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than the level of confidence of a measured mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource may be converted only to a probable mineral reserve.
​
“inferred mineral resource” and “inferred resource” mean “inferred mineral resource” defined by S-K 1300 as that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Because an inferred mineral resource has the lowest level of geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of modifying factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability, an inferred mineral resource may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project, and may not be converted to a mineral reserve.
​
“intrusives” refers to igneous rocks that crystallize below the earth’s surface.
​
“measured mineral resource” and “measured resource” mean “measured mineral resource” defined by S-K 1300 as that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than the level of confidence of either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource, a measured mineral resource may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve.
​
“mineral reserve” is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. 
​



“mineral resource” is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. It is not merely an inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled. 
​
“ore” means material containing minerals in such quantity, grade and chemical composition that they can be economically extracted.
​
“ore sorting” means technology that separates “ore” and “waste” based on physical and/or chemical properties of the material being sorted. 
​
“oxide” means mineralized rock in which some of the original minerals have been oxidized (i.e., combined with oxygen). Oxidation tends to make the rock more porous and permits a more complete permeation of cyanide solutions so that minute particles of gold in the interior of the minerals will be more readily dissolved.
​
“probable mineral reserves” under S-K 1300 is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource.
​
“proven mineral reserves” under S-K 1300 is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource.
​
“qualified person” as defined under S-K 1300 is an individual who is: (1) A mineral industry professional with at least five years of relevant experience in the type of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and in the specific type of activity that person is undertaking on behalf of the registrant; and (2) An eligible member or licensee in good standing of a recognized professional organization at the time the technical report is prepared. For an organization to be a recognized professional organization, it must: (i) Be either: (A) An organization recognized within the mining industry as a reputable professional association; or (B) A board authorized by U.S. federal, state or foreign statute to regulate professionals in the mining, geoscience or related field; (ii) Admit eligible members primarily on the basis of their academic qualifications and experience; (iii) Establish and require compliance with professional standards of competence and ethics; (iv) Require or encourage continuing professional development; (v) Have and apply disciplinary powers, including the power to suspend or expel a member regardless of where the member practices or resides; and (vi) Provide a public list of members in good standing.
​
“recovery” means that portion of the metal contained in the ore that is successfully extracted by processing and is expressed as a percentage.
​
“sampling” means selecting a fractional, but representative, part of a mineral deposit for analysis.
​
“scats” means material in a ball mill or semi autogenous grinding mill (“SAG Mill”) that has become rounded and no longer susceptible to additional size reduction. This material is commonly rejected from the grinding circuit for additional crushing because it contributes to higher energy consumption within the mill. 
​
“strike” when used as a noun, means the direction, course or bearing of a vein or rock formation measured on a level surface and, when used as a verb, means to take such direction, course or bearing.
​
“sulfide” means a compound of sulfur and some other element. From a metallurgical perspective, sulfide rock is primary rock that has not been oxidized. Both ore and waste may contain sulfide minerals.
​
“tailings” means material rejected from a mill after most of the valuable minerals have been extracted.
​
“tpd” means tonnes per day. 
​
“tuffs” are a type of rock consisting of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during a volcanic eruption. 




​
“vein” means a fissure, fault or crack in a rock filled by minerals that have traveled upwards from some deep source.
​
“waste” means rock lacking sufficient grade and/or other characteristics of ore.
​
Cautionary Note to Investors Regarding Estimates Of Measured, Indicated And Inferred Resources And Proven And Probable Mineral Reserves
​
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result we report our mineral reserves and mineral resources according to two different standards. U.S. reporting requirements are governed by S-K 1300. Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by NI 43-101. Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but the standards embody slightly different approaches and definitions. 
​
In our public filings in the U.S. and Canada and in certain other announcements not filed with the SEC, we disclose proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, each as defined in S-K 1300 and NI 43-101. As currently reported, there are no material differences in our disclosed proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resource under each of S-K 1300 and NI 43-101. The estimation of measured resources and indicated resources involve greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic feasibility than the estimation of proven and probable reserves, and therefore investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into S-K 1300-compliant or NI 43-101-compliant reserves. The estimation of inferred resources involves far greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic viability than the estimation of other categories of resources, and therefore it cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically.
