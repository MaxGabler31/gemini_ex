ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013. We became the successor registrant to Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"). Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo", the "Company", "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries. 
WHO WE ARE
We are a leading global healthcare company, delivering value to our customers and consumers by providing Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®. Founded in 1887 as a packager of home remedies, we have built a unique business model that is best described as the convergence of a fast-moving consumer goods company, a high-quality pharmaceutical manufacturing organization and a world-class supply chain network. We believe we are one of the world's largest manufacturers of over-the-counter (“OTC”) healthcare products and suppliers of infant formulas for the store brand market. We are a leading provider of branded OTC products throughout Europe, and also a leading producer of generic pharmaceutical topical products such as creams, lotions, and gels, as well as nasal sprays and injection ("extended topical") prescription drugs. We are headquartered in Ireland, and sell our products primarily in North America and Europe, as well as in other markets, including Australia, Israel and China.
MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS
Restructuring
On February 21, 2017, we approved a workforce reduction plan as part of a larger cost optimization strategy across the Company, which was completed during the year. Our plan was to reduce our global workforce by approximately 750 employees, which included some actions already taken and 235 employees who had elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement program. This represented a reduction of approximately 14% of our global non-production workforce. The changes to our workforce varied by country, based on legal requirements and required consultations with works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $61.0 million of restructuring expenses (refer to Item 8. Note 18). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we executed a supply chain reorganization which continues to generate savings for both our North American and International segments.

Business Overview

Segments
Our reporting segments are as follows:

• | Consumer Healthcare Americas ("CHCA"), comprises our U.S., Mexico and Canada consumer healthcare business (OTC, contract, infant formula and animal health categories).


• | Consumer Healthcare International ("CHCI"), comprises our branded consumer healthcare business primarily in Europe and our consumer focused businesses in the U.K., Australia, and Israel. This segment also includes our U.K. liquid licensed products business.


• | Prescription Pharmaceuticals ("RX"), comprises our U.S. Prescription Pharmaceuticals business.


We also had two legacy operating segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and Active Pharmaceuticals business ("API") businesses, respectively, which we divested (refer to Item 8. Note 2 and Note 6). Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses. Financial information related to our business segments and geographic locations can be found in Item 8. Note 19. Our segments reflect the way in which our management makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. 
Omega Acquisition
On March 30, 2015, we acquired Omega Pharma Invest N.V. ("Omega"), one of the largest OTC companies in Europe, for $3.0 billion in equity and cash and assumed debt of $1.6 billion, for a total purchase price of $4.6 billion. The Omega acquisition expanded our OTC leadership position into continental Europe, accelerated our international expansion and geographic diversification through enhanced scale and a broader footprint, and diversified our net sales and cash flow streams.
The broader European platform established through the Omega acquisition, facilitated the acquisition of a portfolio of well-established OTC brands sold primarily in Europe from GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (“GSK”), on August 28, 2015 and Naturwohl Pharma, GmbH ("Naturwohl"), with its leading German dietary supplement brand, Yokebe®, on September 15, 2015 (refer to Item 8. Note 2). Subsequently, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified impairment indicators associated with certain intangible assets and goodwill, which required us to test these assets for impairment. As a result, we recorded total impairments of $2.0 billion (refer to Item 8. Note 3).
Elan Acquisition
On December 18, 2013, we acquired Elan in a cash and stock transaction totaling $9.5 billion. The acquisition led to the creation of our then new corporate structure headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. We have utilized this structure to continue to grow in our core markets and further expand outside of the U.S. The acquisition also provided us with the Tysabri® financial asset. 
In November 2016, we initiated a strategic review of the Tysabri® financial asset. During this review, we identified impairment indicators of the fair value of that royalty stream, which led to a goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 (refer to Item 8. Note 3 and Note 6 for additional information on the impairment and fair value adjustments, respectively). On March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of the Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in royalties earned if global net sales of Tysabri® meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain during the three months ended April 1, 2017 (refer to Item 8. Note 6 for additional information on the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments).
Divestitures
In addition to the above mentioned Tysabri® financial asset disposal, as a result of our continued efforts to implement certain initiatives, streamline our organization and review our portfolio, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we divested the following (refer to Item 8. Note 2):

Business Overview


• | Certain Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") for $15.0 million in proceeds.


• | Our animal health pet treats plant fixed assets for $7.7 million in proceeds.


• | Our India API business for $22.2 million in proceeds.


• | Our Russian business for €12.7 million ($15.1 million) in proceeds.


• | Our Israel API business for $110.0 million in proceeds.

NEW PRODUCTS
We consider a product to be new if it was (i) reformulated, (ii) involved product line extension due to changes in characteristics such as strength, flavor, or color, (iii) involved a change in product status from "prescription only" ("Rx") to OTC, (iv) was a new generic or branded launch, (v) was provided in a new dosage form or (vi) was sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities, in all cases, within 12 months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured. During the year ended December 31, 2017, new product sales were $209.7 million.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE AMERICAS
Overview
The CHCA segment is focused primarily on the sale of OTC store brand products, including cough, cold, allergy and sinus, analgesic, gastrointestinal, smoking cessation, infant formula and food, animal health, and diagnostic products in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. We are a leading provider of consumer healthcare products sold to consumers via store brands and also sell consumer healthcare products under our own brands. Consumer awareness and knowledge of the quality and value that OTC store brand products represent continues to grow due to retailer efforts to promote their own label programs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our CHCA segment represented approximately 49% of consolidated net sales. 
The CHCA segment develops, manufactures, and markets products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brands. Store brand products must meet the same U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements as national brands within the U.S. and the requirements of comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S. In most instances our product packaging is designed to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products, while communicating store brand value to consumers.
The cost of store brand products to retailers is significantly lower than that of comparable nationally advertised brand-name products. Generally, retailers’ dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product. The retailer, therefore, can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater profit margin. The consumer benefits by receiving a high quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product. As a result, our business model results in consumers saving money on their healthcare spending. 

We are dedicated to continuing to be the leader in developing and marketing new OTC store brand products, including infant formula, and have a research and development ("R&D") staff that we believe is one of the most experienced in the industry at developing products comparable in formulation and quality to national brand products. Our R&D team also responds to changes in existing national brand products by reformulating existing products. For example, in the OTC pharmaceutical market, certain new products are the result of changes in product status from Rx to OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require FDA approval through a process initiated by the drug innovator. The drug innovator usually begins the process by filing a New Drug Application ("NDA"), which is often followed by filing an ANDA. New drugs are also marketed through the FDA's OTC monograph process, which allows for the production of drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective without pre-marketing approval. 
The CHCA segment also develops, manufactures, and distributes certain branded products when the strategy is synergistic with our store brand business. Branded products include the Good Sense®, Sergeant's®, Sentry®, Zephrex D®, PetArmor®, and ScarAway® brand names.
 5

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

We manufacture a significant portion of our CHCA segment's products at our plants in the U.S., Mexico, and Israel, and we source our remaining needs from third parties. We rely on both internal R&D and strategic product development agreements with outside sources to develop new products. In addition, in order to maximize both our capacity and sales of proprietary formulas, we engage in contract manufacturing, which involves producing unique ANDAs and monograph products through partnerships with major pharmaceutical and direct-to-consumer companies.
We believe the increasing age of the population will drive the need for the greater value that our store brand products provide consumers. In addition, we believe that new products and products switching from Rx to OTC (as described above) will continue to drive growth within the segment.
Products
Our CHCA segment offers products in the following categories:

Product Category | Description 
Analgesics | Pain relievers and fever reducers 
Cough/cold/allergy/sinus | Cough, cold, allergy, and sinus products 
Gastrointestinal | Antacids, anti-diarrheal, and anti-heartburn products 
Infant nutritionals | Infant formula and food products 
Smoking cessation | Gums, lozenges, and other products designed to help users quit smoking 
Animal health | Pet health and wellness products 
Other | Feminine hygiene, diabetes care, dermatological care, diagnostic products, scar management, and other miscellaneous healthcare products

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CHCA segment for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

We launched a number of new CHCA products in the year ended December 31, 2017, most notably esomeprazole magnesium (store brand equivalent to Nexium® 24HR capsules), and smoking cessation products. During the year ended December 31, 2017, new product sales in the CHCA segment were $68.7 million.
We, on our own or in conjunction with partners, received final FDA approval from U.S. health authorities for two new products within the CHCA segment in the year ended December 31, 2017, and as of December 31, 2017, we had eight new product applications pending FDA approval.
Sales and Marketing 
Our customers include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains such as Walmart, CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rite Aid, Kroger, Target, Dollar General, Sam’s Club, Costco, Petco, Petsmart, Aldi, Amazon, and major wholesalers, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, and Amerisource Bergen.
We seek to establish customer loyalty through superior customer service by providing a comprehensive assortment of high quality, value-priced products; timely processing, shipment and delivery of orders; assistance in managing customer inventories; and support in managing and building the customer’s store brand business. The CHCA segment employs its own sales force to service larger customers, and uses industry brokers for other retailers. Field sales employees, with support from marketing and customer service, are assigned to specific customers in order to work most effectively with the customer. They assist customers by developing customized brand and in-store marketing programs for customers' store brand products.
The primary objective of this store brand management approach is to enable our customers, retailers and wholesalers, to increase sales of their own store brand products by communicating store brand quality and value to the consumer and by inviting comparison to national brand products. Our sales and marketing personnel assist customers in the development and introduction of new store brand products and in the promotion of customers’ existing store brand products by providing market information; establishing individualized promotions and marketing programs, which may include floor displays, bonus sizes, coupons, rebates, store signs, and promotional packs; and performing consumer research.
In contrast with national brand manufacturers, which incur considerable advertising and marketing expenditures targeted directly to the end user or consumer, the CHCA segment’s primary marketing efforts are channeled through retailers and wholesalers and reach the consumer through our customers’ in-store marketing programs and our digital media programs. Because the retail profit margin for store brand products is generally higher than for national brand products, retailers and wholesalers often commit funds for additional promotions.
Our animal health category, which has a greater emphasis on value-branded products, promotes product awareness through direct-to-consumer advertising, including television commercials, online advertising, in-store display vehicles, and social media. 
In addition to in-store marketing programs, our infant formula category markets directly to consumers and healthcare professionals.
Competition
The markets for OTC pharmaceuticals and infant formula are highly competitive and differ for each product line and geographic region. Our primary competitors include manufacturers, such as LNK International, Inc., PL Developments, and Dr. Reddy's Labs, and brand-name pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Bayer AG, GSK, Nestle S.A. (Gerber), Abbott Nutrition, and Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. The competition is highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage and product categories, such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines. However, some competitors do have larger sales volumes in certain of our categories. Additionally, national brand companies tend to have more resources committed to marketing their products and could in the future manufacture store brands of their products at lower prices than their national brand products. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality, assortment of products, customer service, marketing support, and approvals for new products (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for additional information and risks associated with competition).

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

CONSUMER HEALTHCARE INTERNATIONAL
Overview
The CHCI segment is comprised of our branded OTC sales primarily in Europe and our consumer focused businesses in the U.K., Australia, and Israel. The CHCI segment develops, manufactures, markets and distributes many well-known European OTC brands in the cough, cold and allergy, lifestyle, personal care and derma-therapeutics, natural health and vitamins, and anti-parasite categories. In addition, the segment leverages its broad regulatory, sales, and distribution infrastructure to in-license and sell third-party brands and generic pharmaceutical products. The CHCI segment distributes these products through an extensive network of customers including pharmacies, wholesalers, drug and grocery store retailers, and para-pharmacies in 28 countries, primarily in Europe. Many CHCI products have market leading positions in the markets in which they compete. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the CHCI segment represented approximately 30% of consolidated net sales.
Through continued investment in R&D partnerships and new technologies, the CHCI segment strives to offer high quality products that meet consumers' needs. The combination of internal R&D, in-sourcing, acquisitions, and partnerships support the product pipeline, both in terms of brand expansion and product improvement. In the U.K., R&D focuses on oral liquid formulations for the branded Rx products for which liquid formulations are not available, as well as the development of store brand products and products for the branded business. An additional R&D center resides in Sweden. In the rest of Europe, most R&D is performed by external partners with oversight by our teams. The segment has six plants dedicated to manufacturing certain of its products.
The CHCI segment primarily focuses on building local and regional brands. In many markets outside of the U.S., a brand marketing strategy can be more effective than a store brand strategy due to the absence of mass merchandisers and large scale pharmacy chains. Additionally, the absence of a centralized regulatory environment within Europe adds to the complexity of obtaining approvals for products in these markets.
While the CHCI segment sells products from over 300 brands both on its own and through third parties, it focuses its resources on its "Focus brands", which are selected on the basis of their current sales and growth potential in the OTC market. Additional resources are allocated to these brands to build strong positions in the largest, most highly profitable categories in the OTC market, while maintaining leadership in smaller branded categories. 
Recent Developments

• | Management has developed a strategy to: (1) implement a brand prioritization to address certain market dynamics, with an objective to balance the cost of advertising and promotional investments with expected contributions from category sales, (2) restructure the sales force in certain markets to more effectively serve customers, and (3) in-source certain product manufacturing and development. The combination of these actions is expected to improve the segment's focus on higher value OTC products, reduce selling costs and improve operating margins in the segment.


• | As part of our previously announced strategic initiatives, management implemented improvements and evaluated the overall cost structures within our CHCI segment in the following ways:


• | On December 8, 2016, we announced the cancellation of the unprofitable EuroGenerics NV distribution agreement in Belgium. The year-over-year effect of the cancellation, combined with the exit of certain OTC distribution agreements, reduced our net sales by $200.3 million in 2017, with an immaterial impact to operating income.


• | We made progress on our previously announced restructuring plans to right-size the Omega business due to the impact of market dynamics on sales volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $17.1 million of restructuring expense in the CHCI segment (refer to Item 8. Note 18).

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI


• | Management continues to evaluate the most effective business model for each country, aligning our sales infrastructure and actively integrating sales strategies with promotional programs.


• | On August 25, 2017, we completed the sale of our Russian business, which was previously classified as held-for-sale, to Alvogen Pharma LLC. The total sale price was €12.7 million ($15.1 million), inclusive of an estimated working capital adjustment, which resulted in an immaterial gain in the segment (refer to Item 8. Note 2).

The combination of these actions improved the segment's focus on higher value OTC products, reduced selling costs and improved operating margins in the segment. 

• | The CHCI segment has been positively impacted by market dynamics in countries such as the Nordics, Italy, and Portugal, offset by softness in certain brand categories in France and Germany, as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit.

Products
Below are the categories in which the CHCI segment competes and some of the top brands in each category.

Product Category | Description | Focus Brands 
Cough, Cold, and Allergy | Products that address respiratory symptoms, including traditional medications and alternative treatments such as aromatherapy solutions. | Bittner®/Aflubin®Bronchenolo®/Bronchostop®Coldrex®Libenar®Physiomer®Phytosun®/Valda®Solpadeine®/Antigrippine®
Lifestyle | Weight management, pregnancy and fertility kits, pain relief, sleep management, smoking cessation, and eye care. | Niquitin®Silence®/Nytol®XLS (Medical)®Ymea® 
Personal Care and Derma-Therapeutics | Products for the face and body, including sun care, baby-specific, and feminine hygiene products, and solutions for various skin conditions and allergies such as eczema, psoriasis and rosacea. | ACO®Biodermal®Canoderm®Dermalex®Lactacyd®Wartner® 
Natural Health and Vitamin, Minerals, and Supplements ("VMS") | Vitamins, minerals, supplements, and various other natural remedies. | Abtei®Biover®Davitamon®Granufink® 
Anti-Parasite | Products focused on the elimination of parasites in both humans and pets including lice treatment and insect repellent. | Jungle Formula®Paranix® 

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CHCI segment for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI

We launched a number of new CHCI products in the year ended December 31, 2017, most notably a cold & flu triple active hot drink, various intimate hygiene products, derma-therapeutics, and VMS line extensions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, new product sales in the CHCI segment were $64.1 million.
The CHCI segment has more than 100 strategic new products in five product categories in development, with each of its Focus brands having a five-year innovation master plan. 
Sales and Marketing
Our customers include pharmacies, drug, and grocery stores located primarily in Europe, including Walgreens Boots Alliance, ASDA, Tesco, DM, Rossmann, ETOS, and Kruidvat. The CHCI segment sells its products primarily through an established pharmacy sales force to an extensive network of pharmacists. Our sales representatives visit pharmacists daily, ensuring strong in-store visibility of our brands and facilitating pharmacist education programs. Our sales, marketing, and regulatory teams use training/merchandising teams to work in conjunction with local sales representatives to improve our brands' presence and recognition. We seek to attract key talent from leading OTC, Fast Moving Consumer Goods ("FMCG"), and retailer companies to build strong local teams throughout the countries in which the CHCI segment operates. 
While CHCI products have a higher average gross margin than products sold by the CHCA segment, selling expenses are significantly higher due to the sales force mentioned above, as well as targeted advertising and promotional spending to enhance brand equity. Key marketing communication tools for the CHCI segment include TV commercials, consumer leaflets, product websites, digital and targeted promotional campaigns.
Competition
The competitive landscape of the European OTC market is highly fragmented, as local companies often hold leadership positions in individual product segments in particular countries. As a result, the relevant competition in each of the CHCI segment's markets is both local and global. Competitors include Sarnofi, Bayer, Reckitt Benckiser, GSK, Novartis, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as additional regional competitors. We believe our key advantage lies in our unique combination of best practices in sales, marketing, and product development from 
 10

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI

FMCG and OTC/Rx, while embracing the pharmacy channel to drive self-care (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for additional information and risks associated with competition).
PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS
Overview
The RX segment develops, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of generic prescription drugs primarily in the U.S. We define this portfolio as predominantly "extended" topical as it encompasses a broad array of topical dosage forms such as creams, ointments, lotions, gels, shampoos, foams, suppositories, sprays, liquids, suspensions, solutions, and powders. The portfolio also includes select controlled substances, injectables, hormones, oral solid dosage forms, and oral liquid formulations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the RX segment represented approximately 20% of consolidated net sales.
Our current development areas include other delivery systems such as oral liquids, metered dose inhalers, injectables, and transdermal products, some of which we are developing with third parties. Our other areas of expertise include our production capabilities for controlled substances and hormonal products. R&D efforts focus on complex formulations, many of which require costly clinical endpoint trials.
We manufacture our topical and oral products in the U.S. and Israel, and also source from various FDA-approved third parties. Rx products are manufactured, labeled, and packaged in facilities that comply with strict regulatory standards and meet customers’ stringent requirements.
In addition, the RX segment offers OTC products through the prescription channel (referred to as "ORx®", these products are marketed using the Perrigo name). ORx® products are OTC products that are available for pharmacy fulfillment and healthcare reimbursement when prescribed by a physician. We offer numerous ORx® products that are reimbursable through many health plans and the U.S. Medicaid and Medicare programs. 
We actively collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies to develop, manufacture, and market certain products or groups of products. These types of agreements are common in the pharmaceutical industry. We may choose to enter into these types of agreements to, among other things, leverage our or our collaborators' scientific R&D expertise, or utilize our extensive marketing and distribution resources (refer to Item 8. Note 1 for more information regarding our method for recognizing revenue and expenses related to collaboration agreements, as well as Item 8. Note 17 for more information regarding our collaboration agreements).
Recent Developments

• | We continue to experience a significant reduction in pricing expectations from historical levels in our RX segment due to competitive pressures. This softness in pricing is attributable to various factors, including increased focus from customers to capture supply chain productivity savings, competition in specific products, and consolidation of certain customers. We expect this softness to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future, and we are forecasting a high single digit pricing decline in this segment for the year ending December 31, 2018.


• | We are continuing our previously announced portfolio review process, which includes the ongoing comprehensive internal evaluation of the RX segment's market position, growth opportunities, and interdependencies with our manufacturing and shared service operations to determine if strategic alternatives should be explored related to this segment.


• | During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold various ANDAs for a total gain of $23.0 million.

We launched a number of new RX products in the year ended December 31, 2017, most notably Scopolamine and Testosterone 2% topical (generic equivalent to Axiron®). During the year ended December 31, 2017, new product sales in the RX segment were $75.9 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we, on our own or in collaboration with partners, received final approval from FDA health authorities for 12 Rx drug applications, and as of December 31, 2017, we had 21 Rx drug applications pending approval.
Sales and Marketing
Our customers include major wholesalers, including Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen; sourcing groups such as Red Oak and ClarusOne; national and regional retail drug, supermarket and mass merchandise chains, including Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rite Aid, Walmart, CVS, Kroger, and Safeway; hospitals; and pharmacies. ORx® products are sold to the consumer through the pharmacy counter of predominantly the same retail outlets as our OTC pharmaceutical products.
Competition
The market for Rx products is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of their branded products (known as an authorized generic), manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations, and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Among our generic drug manufacturer competitors are Par Pharmeceuticals, Apotex Corp., Glenmark Generics Inc., Impax Laboratories, Inc., Mylan, Prasco, LLC, Sandoz, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Taro Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Akorn.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
RX

We believe that one of our primary competitive advantages is our ability to introduce difficult to develop and/or manufacture topical generic versions to brand-name drug products. Generally, these products are exposed to less competition due to the relatively longer and more expensive development, clinical trial, and approval processes. In addition, we believe we have a favorable competitive position due primarily to our efficient distribution systems, topical production economies of scale, customer service, and overall reputation (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for more information and risks associated with competition).
SPECIALTY SCIENCES
Overview
The Specialty Sciences segment was comprised of assets focused on the treatment of multiple sclerosis, specifically in connection with the drug Tysabri® (natalizumab). We received contingent payments related to the Tysabri® financial asset until we disposed of it on March 27, 2017.
We were entitled to contingent payments from Biogen Idec Inc. ("Biogen") based on its Tysabri® sales in all indications and geographies. We received contingent payments that were based on royalties of 12% on worldwide Biogen sales of Tysabri® from December 18, 2013 through April 30, 2014. As of May 1, 2014, we received royalties of 18% on annual worldwide Biogen sales of Tysabri® up to $2.0 billion and 25% on annual sales above $2.0 billion. The cash received from Biogen for the royalty percentage on Tysabri® sales was recorded as cash flows from investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.
We had recorded the Tysabri® royalty stream as a financial asset and elected to account for this asset using the fair value option method, which incorporates discounted cash flows related to the expected future cash flows to be received. We used significant judgment in determining our valuation inputs, including estimates as to the probability and timing of future sales of Tysabri®, as well as estimates of the expected future cash flows. The estimated fair value of the asset was subject to variation should those cash flows vary significantly from our estimates. We had performed evaluations at each reporting period to assess those estimates, discount rates utilized and general market conditions affecting fair value (refer to Item 8. Note 6).
The Specialty Sciences segment also included ongoing obligations under the sale agreement between Biogen and Elan for 50% of losses and litigation expenses arising out of any Tysabri® product liability claims, required insurance coverage and related expenses. Effective January 1, 2017, due to the sale of the Tysabri® financial asset, all the above mentioned expenses were moved to unallocated expenses.
On March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments if the royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain during the three months ended April 1, 2017. We elected to account for the contingent milestone payments using the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017 (refer to Item 8. Note 6 and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations).
OTHER
Recent Developments
We had an Other segment that was primarily comprised of sales of API products, which did not meet the quantitative threshold required to be a separate reportable segment. We developed, manufactured, and marketed API products, which were used worldwide by both generic and branded pharmaceutical companies. Certain of these ingredients were used in our own pharmaceutical products. The manufacturing of API occurred primarily in Israel with some production in India.

On April 6, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited. We received $22.2 million of proceeds, inclusive of an estimated working capital adjustment, which resulted in an immaterial gain recorded in Other expense (Income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 (refer to Item 8. Note 2).
On November 21, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business, which was previously classified as held-for-sale to SK Capital, for a sale price of $110.0 million, which resulted in an immaterial gain recorded in Other expense (Income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (refer to Item 8. Note 2 and Note 6).
INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
Research and Development

R&D is a key component of our business strategy and is performed in various locations in the countries in which we operate. While we conduct a significant amount of our own R&D, we also enter into strategic alliance agreements to obtain the rights to manufacture and/or distribute new products. R&D investments were $167.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (refer to Item 8. Note 17).
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we wrote off capitalized in-process research and development from previous acquisitions totaling $12.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively, due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for various projects. 
The year ended December 31, 2017 included R&D expense related to new product development and clinical trial expenses in our CHCA, CHCI and RX segments. The year ended December 31, 2016 included R&D expense related to clinical trial expenses primarily in our CHCA and RX segments. The six months ended December 31, 2015 included incremental R&D expense due to the Omega acquisition. The six months ended December 27, 2014 included a $10.0 million payment made in connection with our entry into a collaboration arrangement. The year ended June 27, 2015 also included incremental R&D expense due to the Omega acquisition, as well as the payment made in relation to the collaboration arrangement noted above, and an R&D contractual arrangement under which we funded $18.0 million of R&D. 
We anticipate that R&D expenditures will increase as a percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future as we continue to cultivate our presence in the Rx-to-OTC switch and generic pharmaceutical markets, and develop our internal R&D capabilities (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with innovation and R&D).
Trademarks and Patents
While we own certain trademarks and patents, neither our business as a whole, nor any of our segments, is materially dependent upon our ownership of any one trademark, or patent, or group of trademarks or patents.
Materials Sourcing
Affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials, bulk tablets, and components may be more limited, as they are available from one or only a few suppliers and may require regulatory approval before we can use them. Prior to the sale of our Israel and India API businesses, we had the ability to manufacture and supply certain API for our OTC and Rx products, which we now source from the companies that have acquired our API business. We have been purchasing an increasing number of components and select finished goods rather than manufacturing them because of the availability of goods, economic reasons, temporary production limitations, FDA restrictions, sale of our API business, and other factors.
Historically, we have been able to react effectively to situations that require alternate sourcing. Should such alternate sourcing be necessary, FDA requirements placed on products approved through the ANDA or NDA 
 14

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results. We believe we have good, cooperative working relationships with substantially all of our suppliers and have historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to our volume of purchases (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with materials sourcing).
Manufacturing and Distribution
Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the U.S. We also have manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Belgium, France, Germany, Austria, Israel, Mexico, and Australia, along with a joint venture in China (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with our manufacturing facilities). We supplement our production capabilities with the purchase of products from outside sources. The capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times for various reasons, such as customer demand, the seasonality of the cough/cold/flu, allergy, or flea and tick seasons, and new product launches. We may utilize available capacity by performing contract manufacturing for other companies. We have logistics facilities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico, Australia, and numerous locations throughout Europe. We use contract freight and common carriers to deliver our products.
Significant Customers
Our primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current global retail drug industry marketplace. Walmart is our largest customer and accounted for the following percentage of consolidated net sales:

Year Ended | | Six Months Ended | | Year Ended 
December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | December 27, 2014 | | June 27, 2015
13 | % | | 13 | % | 13 | % | | 19 | % | 16 | %

 Sales to Walmart are primarily in the CHCA segment. As a percentage of our total U.S. OTC sales, our sales to Walmart generally align with Walmart's U.S. retail market share in the products we sell to them. In addition, while no other customer individually comprises more than 10% of net sales, we do have other significant customers. We believe we generally have good relationships with all of our customers (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with customers).
Environmental
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We have made, and continue to make, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws, but do not believe that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations have been or will be material to our business. We do not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding.
While we believe that climate change could present risks to our business, including increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to our facilities, water limitations, and disruptions to our supply chain, we do not believe these risks are material to our business in the near term. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We are committed to doing business in an ethical manner. We have a long history of environmentally sound and efficient operations, safe and healthy working conditions, and active participation in the communities where we are located. As reflected in our Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment Statement available on our website, we remain committed to:

• | Helping consumers access safe, effective and affordable healthcare products;


• | Strong corporate governance;


• | Complying with regulatory and legal requirements;


• | Demonstrating environmental stewardship;

 15

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1


• | Continuously improving packaging sustainability;


• | Protecting human rights of our global employees and challenging our partners to do the same;


• | Diversity of thought, experience and perspective;


• | Providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees; and


• | Establishing effective community partnerships.

Through these efforts, we strive to minimize our impact on the environment, drive responsible business practices, and ensure the welfare of our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate now and into the future.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICING
The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, advertising, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by a variety of agencies in the localities in which our products are sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by various organizations. We believe that our policies, operations, and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which we are subject (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for related risks).
United States Regulation
U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
The FDA has jurisdiction over our Rx, OTC drug products, API, and Infant Formula Foods. The FDA’s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of these products. We are committed to consistently providing our customers with high quality products that adhere to "current Good Manufacturing Practices" ("cGMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA.
OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 
All facilities where Rx and OTC products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, or distributed for the U.S. market must comply with FDA cGMPs and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries, states and localities where the facilities are located. All of our drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. 
Many of our OTC products are regulated under the OTC monograph system and subject to certain FDA regulations. Under this system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. Products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula, and labeling requirements, including permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients, and dosage levels. It is generally less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. 
            We also market generic prescription drugs and non-prescription products that have switched from prescription to OTC status. Prior to commercial marketing, these products require approval by the FDA of an ANDA or NDA that provides information on chemistry, manufacturing controls, clinical safety, efficacy and/or bioequivalence, packaging, and labeling. While the development process for these drugs generally requires less time and expense than the development process of a new drug, the size and duration of required studies can vary greatly. Prior to the onset of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (“GDUFA”), the FDA approval of generic drug applications took approximately three to five times longer than approval of innovator drugs. Pursuant to GDUFA II, beginning October 1, 2017, year five of the program, the FDA pledged to complete a first cycle review on 90% of electronic generic applications within 10 months of submission.
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ("FFDCA") (the Hatch-Waxman amendments), a company submitting an NDA can obtain a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for a prescription or OTC product if it performs a clinical study that is essential to FDA approval. Longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities, orphan drugs (those designated under section 526 of the FFDCA) and drugs under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act. During this exclusivity period, the FDA cannot 
 16

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

approve any ANDAs for a similar or equivalent generic product, which can preclude another party from marketing a similar product during this period. A company may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if it conducts pediatric studies requested by the FDA on the product. This exclusivity can delay both the FDA approval and sales of certain products.
A company may be entitled to a 180-day generic exclusivity period for certain products. This exclusivity period often follows a patent certification and litigation process whereby the product innovator may sue for infringement. The legal action does not ordinarily result in material damages, but it generally triggers a statutorily mandated delay in FDA approval of the ANDA for a period of up to 30 months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") was signed into law on July 9, 2012. The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain, and a limited extension of the 30-month stay provision described above. The FDASIA also reduced the time required for FDA responses to generic-blocking citizen petitions. We implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self-identification and user fee requirements of the FDASIA, and we monitor facility self-identification and fee payment compliance to mitigate the risk of potential supply chain interruptions or delays in regulatory approval of new applications.
The U.S. government's Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. The serialization of all Rx products distributed in the U.S. needed to be completed by November 26, 2018, with the requirement for tracking the products commencing on November 27, 2023. Requirements for the tracing of products at the lot level through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain went into effect on January 1, 2015 for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. 
Infant Formula and Foods 
The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has labeling responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether an infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.
All manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients, which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives. The Infant Formula Act provides specific requirements for infant formula to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas, including minimum and, in some cases, maximum levels of specified nutrients.
Before marketing a particular infant formula, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation consistent with the FDA’s labeling, nutrient content, and manufacturer quality control requirements. A manufacturer must notify the FDA at least 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. We actively monitor this process and make the appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with recent FDA rules regarding cGMP, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records for the production of infant formulas.
In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life; to keep records on production, testing, and distribution of each batch of infant formula; to use cGMP and quality control procedures; and to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which may reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula, inspects new facilities during early production runs, and collects and analyzes samples of infant formula. Our infant formula manufacturing facilities have been inspected by the FDA after the effective date of the final rule and found to be in full compliance with the new GMP regulations with no corrective actions required.
 17

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Our infant and toddler foods are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which protects the safety of U.S. foods by mandating comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. Under FSMA, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers and is taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of a safety issue. 
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
Third parties develop and manufacture API for use in certain of our products that are exported to the U.S. and other global markets. Before API can be commercialized in the U.S., the manufacturer and/or developer must submit a drug master file ("DMF") that provides the proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance, and the facilities and procedures must be cGMP compliant before API may be exported to the U.S. 
The facilities and products are subject to regulation by the applicable regulatory bodies in the place of manufacture as well as the regulatory agency in the country from which the product is exported or imported. For API exported to European markets, the manufacturer must submit a European DMF and, where applicable, obtain a certificate of suitability from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. The manufacturing facilities and production procedures for API marketed in Europe must meet EU-GMP and European Pharmacopeia standards.
U.S. Department of Agriculture
The Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic." Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") National Organic Program for production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products. Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides. The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show that their products will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the U. S., pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, such as morphine, hydromorphone, opium, testosterone, midazolam, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose registration, security, record keeping, reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V, with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. We are subject to the requirements regarding the controlled substances in Schedules II - V and the List I chemicals. Our facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any controlled substances must register annually with the DEA.
 18

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting, and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration, and it also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registration, or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. We are also subject to state laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of certain products.
Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation

Within the U.S., government healthcare insurance and welfare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs are important third party payers for patients who take our products. These programs include several indirect forms of price regulation applicable to our drug products as a condition to coverage and/or payment for our products, and also regulate the amount that pharmacies and other healthcare providers will be paid for our products. Specifically, U.S. law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having federal funds being made available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, enter into three government pricing program agreements: (i) a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program; (ii) a 340B program agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide discounts to certain “covered entity” safety net healthcare providers; and (iii) a Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") under which discounts are available for purchases by federal agencies. We have such agreements in effect. 
Medicaid Rebate Agreement
The Medicaid rebate agreement requires the drug manufacturer to remit rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis for both fee-for-service and Medicaid managed care organization utilization. Rebate amounts are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), including Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP") and, in the case of innovator products, Best Price ("BP"). U.S. law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report average sales price ("ASP") information to CMS for each calendar quarter for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.
Under the Medicaid rebate program, the minimum rebate amounts due are as follows: (i) for noninnovator products, in general generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter; and (ii) for innovator products, in general brand-name products marketed under NDAs, the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the BP for that same quarter. Manufacturers also pay an “additional rebate" on innovator drugs where price increases since launch have outpaced inflation. Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, an additional rebate is due for noninnovator products, which is calculated somewhat differently from the innovator product additional rebate, but likewise generally applies where and to the extent that a manufacturer’s AMP increases faster than the rate of inflation.
CMS issued a final regulation, generally effective April 1, 2016, to implement changes to the Medicaid rebate program under the 2010 health reform legislation (“Health Reform Law”) and otherwise to provide program guidance. In addition to guidance concerning rebate program administration matters, the regulation also addressed certain related Medicaid reimbursement matters. First, under the Health Reform Law, CMS has also begun to use manufacturer AMP data to calculate reimbursement limits for pharmacies for multiple source drugs under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limits ("FULs"). CMS also surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis for comparing their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. Second, the regulation also directed states to update their Medicaid payment methodologies to provide for payment amounts designed to reflect pharmacies’ "actual acquisition costs" for drugs, a change from the prior "estimated acquisition" standard. The regulation also required states to provide the government with findings to support their compliance with this standard by April 1, 2017. 
Pricing and rebate calculations are governed by statutory and regulatory requirements that are complex, vary among products and programs, can change over time, and are subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. In the case of the Medicaid rebate program, if we become aware of errors in 
 19

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

our prior price submissions, or a prior BP submission needs to be updated due to late arriving data, we must resubmit the updated data within specified time frames. Such restatements and recalculations increase our cost of compliance with the Medicaid rebate program, and corrections can result in an overage or underage of our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction.
340B Program Agreement
The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ceiling price is derived from the data the manufacturer reports under the Medicaid rebate program and therefore any changes to statutory or regulatory requirements applicable to the Medicaid price figures may impact the 340B ceiling price calculation as well. 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as certain hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 
Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs

U.S. law also requires any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program and Medicare Part B and that wants its covered drugs paid for by certain federal agencies and grantees to enter into a Master Agreement with the VA. Under the Master Agreement, the company must offer its innovator drugs for procurement under the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) contracting program, and must charge certain agencies (VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and the Coast Guard) no more than a statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is calculated based on Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“NFAMP”) data we submit to the VA. FSS contracts include extensive disclosure and certification requirements and standard government terms and conditions with which we must comply. Consistent with VA’s interpretation of the Master Agreement, we have also entered into an agreement to pay rebates on covered drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.
Medicare Part D “Coverage Gap” Rebates
For certain innovator products, manufacturers must also enter into an agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide rebates with respect to utilization of their products by certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries while those patients are within the Medicare Part D benefit “coverage gap.” Manufacturers are not required to submit separate pricing data under this program; the rebate amount is calculated by CMS based on Part D plans’ “negotiated prices” paid to pharmacies.
Other Price Regulation
In addition to these technical government pricing regulation programs, drug pricing has come under increasing public scrutiny arising out of general concerns about high drug costs or price increases, and transparency of pricing and discounting practices within the pharmaceutical distribution system. Several states, including Maryland, Nevada, and California, have recently enacted laws that prohibit “price gouging,” require manufacturers to report certain information concerning price increases exceeding certain amounts, and/or provide advance notice of price increases to certain entities (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks related to the above-mentioned programs). 
Other U.S. Regulations and Organizations
We are subject to various other federal, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products requires substantial effort, expense and capital investment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations, legislation, regulation and laws that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

• | Physician Payment Sunshine Act - This act requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payment database and public reporting of the payment data.

 20

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation


• | Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") - This act and other similar anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.


• | Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") - This agency oversees the advertising and other promotional practices of consumer products marketers. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC also reviews mergers and acquisitions of companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigates certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry.


• | International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") - The ISO Standards specify requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement. Our infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually.


• | United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. ("USP") - The USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. By reference, the FFDCA incorporates the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") - We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.


• | Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") - The CPSC has published regulations requiring child resistant packaging on certain products including pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements.


• | Anti-Bribery Laws - Various jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior.


• | Other State Agencies - We are subject to regulation by numerous other state health departments, insurance departments, boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies, state consumer health and safety regulations, and other comparable state agencies, each of which have license requirements and fees that vary by state.

Regulation Outside the U.S. 
We develop and manufacture products and market third-party manufactured products in regions outside the U.S., including Eastern and Western Europe, Israel, Mexico, Australia, countries in Asia, South America, and the Middle East, each of which has its own regulatory environment. The majority of our sales outside the U.S. are in the following categories: OTC/Rx pharmaceuticals, medical devices, dietary supplements and cosmetics. Other regulatory agencies, organizations and legislation that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

• | Privacy Regulations - We are subject to numerous global laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection (which will be replaced by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) from May 2018 onward). The GDPR will introduce more stringent data protection requirements in the European Union ("EU"), as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR.

Regulation


• | Transparency Laws - In various jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the laws and regulations aimed at increasing transparency of financial relationships between healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical/medical device manufacturers.

European Union
OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 
The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market. However, obtaining regulatory agreement across member states presents complex challenges that can lead to delays in the regulatory process. 
In the EU, as well as many other locations around the world, the manufacture and sale of medicinal products are regulated in a manner substantially similar to that of the U.S. requirements, which generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing, and importation of any medicinal product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain data related to product efficacy and safety, including results of clinical testing and/or references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or if it is manufactured or marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions.
Between 1995 and 1998, the over-arching regulation that governs medicinal products was revised in an attempt to simplify and harmonize product registration. This revised legislation introduced the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), whereby after approval of a marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in the reference member state (“RMS”), additional marketing authorizations could be submitted to other concerned member states to obtain a product license. In November 2005, the medicinal product legislation was further revised to introduce the decentralized procedure (“DCP”), whereby marketing authorizations are submitted simultaneously to the RMS and select concerned member states. In 2005, the EMA also opened up the centralized procedure to sponsors of marketing authorizations for generic medicinal products. Unlike the MRP and DCP, the centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization and product labeling across all member states that will allow a sponsor to file for individual country reimbursement and make the medicine available in all the EU countries listed on the application. Marketing authorizations and subsequent product licenses are granted to applicants only after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 
In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer’s facilities obtain approval from an EU Regulatory Authority. The EU has a code of GMP that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. We believe that our policies, operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which our operations are subject.
EU Member States had to transpose the European Falsified Medicines Directive (the “Directive”) into national law by January 2, 2013. The transposition process is now complete. The provisions of the Directive are intended to reduce the risk of counterfeit medicines entering the supply chain and also to ensure the quality of API manufactured outside of the EU. The Directive required the serialization of all Rx and some OTC products, similar to the DSCSA in the U.S.
In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of prescription medicinal products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing for generics; generally “tendering” refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the government by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, suppliers of a product in a particular country.
Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, although the application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities 
 22

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.
The requirements deriving from European pharmacovigilance regulation are constantly expanding due to increasing guidance on good vigilance practices and increased communication on inspectors’ expectations. Pharmacovigilance fee regulation became effective in late 2014 to support health authority assessment of pharmacovigilance safety evaluation reports, study protocols for post authorization safety studies and referrals. Once approved, the advertising of pharmaceuticals in the EU is governed by national regulations and guidelines. Within certain member states this is overseen by a self-certification process whereas in others national governance bodies approve material prior to release.
The wholesale distribution of medicinal products is an important activity in the integrated supply chain management. The quality and the integrity of medicinal products can be affected by a lack of adequate control. To this end, the EU Commission has published guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of medicinal products for human use in 2013. The present guidelines are based on Articles 84 and 85b(3) of medicinal products for human use directive. 
Medical Devices
The EU has enacted into law numerous directives and adopted many harmonizing standards pertaining to a wide range of industrial products, including medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives are entitled to bear the CE marking of conformity, which indicates that the device conforms to the applicable requirements of the directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state. Assessment by a Notified Body includes an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and may also include specific testing of the product. This assessment is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. 
Dietary Supplements 
Dietary supplements are subject to several regulations that inform the selection of ingredient levels and how products can be described on packaging and in advertising. These regulations include: Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC, Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, Permitted Vitamins and Minerals Regulation (EC) 1170/2009, Food Additives Regulation (EC) 1333/2008, Nutritional & Health Claims Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Foods Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses Directive 2009/39/EC, and Regulation (EU) 609/2013.
EU rules on nutrition and health claims, which were established by Regulation EC 1924/2006, apply to any nutritional or health claim by a manufacturer. The objective of the regulation is to ensure that claims made in food labeling or advertising are clear, accurate and based on scientific evidence. The European Food Safety Authority, an advisory panel to the European Commission, performs all scientific assessments of health claims on food and supplement labels. An EU register of nutrition and health claims exists to document approved, pending, and rejected claims. 
Cosmetics
Cosmetic products in the EU market must comply with Regulation EC No. 1223/2009. This regulation requires manufacturers to prepare a product safety report prior to placing a cosmetic product in the market. In addition, for each cosmetic product placed in the market, a “responsible person” must be designated to oversee compliance with the regulation’s reporting requirements. Commission Regulation EU No. 655/2013 establishes the common criteria and justification for claims to be used in the packaging and advertising of cosmetics products.
