Item 1.  Business
Overview
AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 17, 1991. Unless otherwise noted or indicated by the context, the terms “AquaBounty,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries. Headquartered in Maynard, Massachusetts, we are a biotechnology company focused on enhancing productivity in the fast-growing aquaculture market. Our principal place of business is located at 2 Mill & Main Place, Suite 395, Maynard, Massachusetts 01754, and our telephone number at that location is (978) 648-6000.
On January 19, 2017, our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AQB.” Prior to our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we were listed in 2006 on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”), the London Stock Exchange’s international market for smaller growing companies, initially under the symbol “ABTX” and, commencing in 2014, under the symbol “ABTU.” For the period from January 19, 2017, to May 31, 2017, we were dual listed on both the Nasdaq Capital Market and AIM. Effective June 1, 2017, we voluntarily delisted our common stock from AIM.
We use genetic modification and other molecular biologic techniques to improve the quality and yield of fish stocks and help the aquaculture industry meet growing consumer demand. Since 2008, we have been focused on the regulatory approval of our AquAdvantage Salmon product. Since that time, we completed the New Animal Drug Application (“NADA”) process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for AquAdvantage Salmon, and, on November 19, 2015, we received approval of the NADA for the production, sale, and consumption of AquAdvantage Salmon.
On May 19, 2016, we received approval from Health Canada, the department of the government of Canada with responsibility for national public health, for the production, sale, and consumption of AquAdvantage Salmon as a novel food and feed in Canada. Previously, we had received approval from Environment Canada, the agency of the government of Canada with responsibility for regulating environmental policies and issues, which decided that AquAdvantage Salmon was not harmful to the environment or human health when produced in contained facilities. Consequently, we have now received approvals for our product from what we believe are two of the most respected and rigorous regulatory agencies in the world.
We believe that receipt of FDA approval for AquAdvantage Salmon not only represents a major milestone for us, but is also a significant pioneering development in introducing transgenic animals into the food chain. Although genetically modified crops have been accepted by consumers in the United States and South America for some time, AquAdvantage Salmon is the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption. We intend to deploy AquAdvantage Salmon in land-based, contained, freshwater aquaculture systems, which would allow inland fish farms to be established close to major demand centers in a profitable and environmentally sustainable manner. The technology underlying AquAdvantage Salmon offers the potential to reintroduce salmon aquaculture in the United States, which imported more than $2.6 billion of Atlantic salmon in 2016 according to the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “DOC”).
See “—Our Product” for more information on AquAdvantage Salmon and “—Regulatory Environment” for more information on our completed NADA process with the FDA.
Based on a provision added to the 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act, the FDA is required to maintain an Import Alert prohibiting import of AquAdvantage Salmon into the United States until such labeling guidance is finalized. For more information, see “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may become subject to increasing regulation, changes in existing regulations, and review of existing regulatory decisions.”
We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have made our first sales of AquAdvantage Salmon from our farm site in Panama and expect modest revenues during 2018, with more significant revenues expected in the second half of 2019 once our facilities in Indiana and on Prince Edward Island are in full production. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we experienced net losses of $9.3 million, $8.5 million, and $7.0 million, respectively.
Management is pursuing several paths to revenue generation that follow different timelines, including production of our fish at our existing farm sites, purchase or construction of additional production facilities in North America, and licensing or partnership arrangements. Additionally, management is pursuing regulatory approval for AquAdvantage Salmon in Brazil, Argentina, China, and Chile.
The Aquaculture Industry
Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and aquatic plants. It involves cultivating freshwater or saltwater species under controlled conditions, as an alternative to the commercial harvesting of wild species of aquatic organisms. According to Research and Markets, an industry research organization, the global aquaculture market was valued at $176.5 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5% to reach a market size of $219.4 billion by the year 2022. We 
1

believe that the aquaculture industry, and in particular salmon farming, is poised for significant additional growth in the coming years as the global population expands.
Salmon Farming
Atlantic salmon farming is a major industry in the cold-water countries of the northern and southern hemispheres. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (“FAO”), Atlantic salmon aquaculture production grew by approximately 6.7% annually between 2000 and 2015. Total production volume of farmed Atlantic salmon during 2015 was just under 2.4 million metric tons with a value over $11.9 billion. Industry analyst Kontali Analyse expects increases in demand to drive continued production growth through 2020, although at a lower annual rate of approximately 3.0%, primarily due to supply constraints.
Below is a break-down by major producing country for the time period 2010 through 2015, which is the last year for which data is readily available.

Pricing
According to the DOC, which tracks the volume and value of Atlantic salmon imports into the United States, from 2011 to 2016 the average wholesale price of Atlantic salmon imported into the country increased from $3.81 per pound ($8.39/kilogram) to $4.30 per pound ($9.48/kilogram).
The daily spot (farm-gate or wholesale market) price for Atlantic salmon is very volatile due to the species’ long production cycle, which typically ranges between two and three years, and its short shelf life, which typically ranges between two and three weeks. Farmed salmon is typically sold as fresh and thus must be consumed within this timeframe. Consequently, the available supply is very inelastic over the short term, while demand can be very elastic due to price, season, or market size.
Major Producers
The global Atlantic salmon farming industry includes several very large companies with operations in each of the major producing countries. Consolidation has been evident in the past few years as producers attempt to gain competitive cost advantages while overcoming the regulatory challenges associated with developing new marine farm sites. Major market producers, and their primary country of operation, include the following companies: Marine Harvest (Norway), Leroy Seafood Group ASA (Norway), Cermaq ASA (Norway), SalMar ASA (Norway), Empresas AquaChile S.A. (Chile), and Cooke Aquaculture Inc. (Canada).
U.S. Atlantic Salmon Market
According to the DOC, in 2016 the United States imported a record 619 million pounds (279 thousand metric tons) of Atlantic salmon with an aggregate market value of approximately $2.66 billion, or $4.30 per pound. The DOC also reported that over 75% of the total quantity of Atlantic salmon imports into the United States in 2016 originated from Chile and Canada. The Atlantic salmon farming industry in the United States contracted significantly beginning in the 1990s in the face of environmental concerns and lower costs of production from foreign sources, notably Chile. According to the FAO, a total of only 41 million pounds of farmed Atlantic salmon was produced in the United States in 2015, representing only 6.3% of the total farmed Atlantic salmon supplied.
Despite intensive public consumer education campaigns promoting its health benefits, seafood consumption in the United States still lags behind other protein sources and trails consumption in overseas markets. According to the DOC, during the period from 2007 to 2012, annual seafood consumption in the United States ranged between 14 and 16 pounds per capita, significantly behind consumption of chicken (80 to 85 pounds), beef (57 to 65 pounds), and pork (46 to 50 pounds). In comparison, according to SeaFood Business magazine, average seafood consumption throughout Europe was 48.5 pounds per capita in 2012. In 2016, average seafood consumption in the US was 14.9 pounds according to the National Fisheries Institute and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Perception of Genetically Modified Atlantic Salmon
Though Atlantic salmon is the second-most-consumed seafood in the United States, activist groups opposing genetic modifications of organisms have pressured a number of retail food outlets and grocery chains to publicly state that they will not carry genetically modified Atlantic salmon.
However, we do not expect that this will have a significant impact on overall consumer demand and product placement in the marketplace generally, and in particular the wholesale marketplace. To date, large wholesalers have not followed the example of these retailers, and we believe that there will be sufficient demand from smaller retailers, wholesalers, and institutional seafood buyers to absorb our projected production. We believe that FDA approval reinforces the message that AquAdvantage Salmon is a safe and nutritious seafood product that is equivalent to conventional farmed Atlantic salmon. This belief is based in part on the results of a 2014 survey released by the International Food Information Council, titled “Consumer Perceptions of Food Technology,” which indicated that 59% of consumers are “somewhat” or “very” likely to buy genetically engineered seafood if the FDA deems it safe.
There are surveys that have been cited by various non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) that indicate that consumers are reluctant to purchase genetically modified food and that they would like to see labeling in order to avoid it. Consumer acceptance could also be adversely affected if AquAdvantage Salmon were found or believed to grow to a larger final size than traditional Atlantic salmon. In addition, our regulatory burdens could also increase. Internally generated data has shown that, although AquAdvantage Salmon exhibit an accelerated growth rate in early development stages, they do not grow to a larger end size than conventional Atlantic salmon. In response to these perceptions, we plan to educate consumers on the benefits of AquAdvantage Salmon versus conventional Atlantic salmon, including 25% better feed conversion (meaning less feed is needed to produce the same harvest), a lower carbon footprint due to local production, reduced impact on the environment and reduced exposure of the fish to environmental toxins due to use of land-based aquaculture systems, and reduced reliance on chemotherapeutics due to improved biosecurity.
Atlantic Salmon Disease Impact
An area of concern with current Atlantic salmon farming production is the environmental impact and the cost of disease management associated with those operations. Salmon farming systems, particularly conventional, open sea-cage systems, are vulnerable to disease introduction and transmission, primarily from the marine environment or adjacent culture systems. The economic impact of disease to these production systems can be significant, as farmers must incur the cost of preventative measures, such as vaccines and antibiotics and then, if infected, the cost of lost or reduced harvests.
The most prevalent disease and health management issues are infectious salmon anemia (“ISA”) and sea lice. ISA is a viral disease in Atlantic salmon, and outbreaks have occurred in virtually every major salmon farming geography since 1984, including a major event in Chile in 2008 that impacted the country’s production for three years. There is currently no effective treatment for the disease, and the salmon farming industry relies on vaccines and health management practices to mitigate its impact. Though primarily occurring in traditional sea-cage farming environments, ISA can also be introduced into populations that are in land-based, self-contained facilities. In November 2009, certain fish from our land-based hatchery on Prince Edward Island tested positive for ISA. In response, we notified the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (“DFO”) following discovery of the virus, which was diagnosed as a strain with low pathogenicity and of unknown origin. We conducted an extensive screening program of all fish in the facility, destroying any fish that tested positive for ISA.
Subsequent tests conducted by DFO of fish in the facility began in March 2010 and indicated that the virus had been eliminated from the facility. We enacted improvements in biosecurity and facility operation, and the facility regained its disease-free status from DFO after four consecutive tests indicated no presence of the virus. The fish health status of the facility continues to be monitored by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The facility has not had any reportable disease outbreaks since the isolated incident in 2009.
Sea lice are marine parasites that occur naturally and attach to the skin of Atlantic salmon. Though a few lice on a large salmon present no problem, the presence of significant numbers can adversely impact the health and aesthetic appearance of the fish. The cost of managing sea lice in sea-cage farming environments can be significant.
The closed, contained, land-based production systems, using technology referred to as recirculating aquaculture systems (“RAS”), proposed for the grow-out of AquAdvantage Salmon, are less susceptible, though not immune, to the same disease-related pressures because this type of culture system is isolated from the environment. RAS facilities employ sophisticated water treatment technology including the use of ozone, salt treatment, and ultraviolet radiation to kill potential bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens that might enter the system. In addition, incoming water is similarly filtered and treated prior to entering the system, and water quality is regularly measured as part of the standard procedures. The fish in RAS facilities are generally not vaccinated against typical fish diseases, and no antibiotics, pesticides, or pharmacological agents are typically required. RAS facilities employ effective biosecurity to prevent disease by reducing or eliminating the introduction of pathogens and continuously treating the water to assure optimal fish health. RAS production will allow the AquAdvantage Salmon to be raised in optimized conditions with total control of the water coming in and going out of the system, while recirculating greater than 95% of the water used.
In contrast, sea cage, or conventional aquaculture fish, are housed in large cages in coastal waterways exposed to currents which can bring a variety of pathogens in contact with the farmed salmon. The presence of pathogens in an uncontrolled environment is a universally accepted fact in human and animal health. The presence of disease agents in these uncontrolled water currents could result 
3

in infection and spread of infection within the captive population. The risks and outcomes of conventional, open sea-cage systems are well established, and are often evidenced by outbreaks of a variety of bacterial and viral diseases as well as water fouling and contamination due to algal blooms and similar events. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics, vaccines, and other pharmacological agents is similarly well documented in conventional systems, presenting a risk to the environment and also to the consumers of treated fish.
Further, stocking RAS facilities with disease-free eggs results in a much higher degree of biosecurity and protection from disease. We expect that production and economic losses due to disease will be significantly less in the closed, land-based culture systems proposed for the production of AquAdvantage Salmon, because of greater control over environmental conditions and superior biosecurity than in traditional Atlantic salmon production systems.
Restrictions on Atlantic Salmon Farming
Environmental concerns have led certain states to impose legislative and regulatory restrictions or bans on the farming of Atlantic salmon. This could reduce the number of potential sites available to us for production farms in the United States. Nevertheless, we expect that many states will offer excellent potential sites for AquAdvantage Salmon production systems.
Our Product
Our product, AquAdvantage Salmon, is a genetically modified Atlantic salmon that can grow to marketable size in about half the time of traditional farmed Atlantic salmon. By placing a second copy of the salmon growth hormone gene under the control of an alternative genetic promoter (gene switch) from the ocean pout, an edible marine fish, more consistent levels of growth hormone are released, which accelerates the early stages of the salmon’s development. By accelerating growth in the early stages of rearing, these fish can reach a marketable size sooner. In the case of Atlantic salmon, this can reduce farming time from 28 to 36 months to 18 to 20 months.
This accelerated growth has several advantages, both economic and environmental. The faster life cycle, from birth to harvesting, of AquAdvantage Salmon as compared to conventional salmon will allow it to be produced more economically in contained inland systems. Although this requires greater capital investment than the sea cage approach, we believe that the higher costs will be offset by more efficient growth, 25% better feed conversion, reduced exposure to environmental threats, and more effective control of disease. In addition, with a facility located nearer to the major food markets, we believe there will be savings on transportation of the harvested stock, a reduced carbon footprint, and an improved ability to get fresh product to market faster.
Plan of Operation
Our core business is to develop and market superior products to improve productivity in aquaculture. Our first product is the AquAdvantage Salmon, which received FDA and Health Canada approval as the first genetically modified animal for human consumption as food. Our business plan contemplates that we will initially establish two production facilities to prove the economic benefit and consumer acceptance for our product. We have begun construction of a 250-metric-ton production unit in Rollo Bay, Prince Edward Island, which will be operational in 2018. We have also acquired an existing facility in Albany, Indiana, which is currently undergoing upgrades to increase its annual production capacity to 1200 metric tons. Both of these facilities must be approved by the FDA prior to their initial stocking with AquAdvantage Salmon, but we anticipate both to be operational in 2018 with a first harvest of commercial production in late 2019.
Once these farm sites reach full production operation, we intend to explore additional channels to commercialize the product. Such efforts may involve producing AquAdvantage Salmon eggs for commercial production, licensing the technology to salmon growers, or continuing to grow out the salmon in our own land-based facilities.
In order to scale up our egg production capabilities, we have begun construction on a new broodstock facility at our farm site in Rollo Bay. Once completed and at full capacity, this facility will be capable of producing sufficient fertilized AquAdvantage Salmon eggs to satisfy our requirements for at least the next five years.
We intend to continue investing in research and development. We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase as we continue to develop our other AquAdvantage fish products and initiate new research projects under the Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement that we entered into in February 2013 with Intrexon Corporation (the “ECC”). See the section of this 10-K titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement.” The timeline for development projects will depend on many factors, but could extend beyond ten to fifteen years, taking into account the time needed for development, regulatory approval, and pre-marketing activities.
Any additions to headcount in our research and production activities will depend on the number of development activities we undertake and the success of our commercialization efforts for AquAdvantage Salmon. We expect to increase our headcount in administration at our corporate headquarters as we begin to commercialize our product.
Our Markets
With regulatory approvals in the United States and Canada, we plan to market AquAdvantage Salmon throughout both countries. In addition, we intend to focus on those significant fish farming markets where we believe we will have success in gaining further 
4

regulatory approvals and consumer acceptance. We currently expect to market AquAdvantage Salmon in the United States and Canada, as well as Panama, Argentina, Brazil, China, and Chile following receipt of required regulatory approval in the respective jurisdictions.
If we pursue a commercial strategy to sell AquAdvantage Salmon eggs, we expect the cost of production for each AquAdvantage Salmon egg will be higher than the industry norm, but will fall significantly once production volume increases. While no pricing structure has been set, we believe that the cost savings associated with AquAdvantage Salmon resulting from the ability to spread fixed costs over a greater number of fish and reduced grow-out time will allow AquAdvantage Salmon eggs to sell at a premium to standard Atlantic salmon eggs.
If we pursue a commercial strategy to grow out AquAdvantage Salmon in our own land-based facilities, we expect our production costs to be lower than traditional salmon farming due to the faster growth rate and 25% better feed conversion rate of our fish, along with lower relative transportation costs.
The salmon distribution system in the United States is complex and varied. Participants include fishermen, fish farmers, processors, importers, secondary processors, broadline distributors, specialty seafood distributors, brokers, traders, and many different kinds of retail and food service companies. Salmon distribution channels are evolving, with fewer and larger distributors handling an increasing share of total volume and an increasing share of salmon being sold directly by large fish-farming companies and large wild salmon processors to large retail and food service chains. We expect that harvested AquAdvantage Salmon will be sold into this distribution network.
Regulatory Environment
United States Regulation of Genetically Modified Products
The genetic modification of food using the tools of modern biotechnology is regulated in the United States by two government organizations, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) for genetically modified plants and the FDA for genetically modified animals.
The regulatory system for genetically modified plants is based upon the Coordinated Framework, issued by the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1986 and regulated by the USDA’s Bureau of Regulatory Services and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services under the Federal Plant Pest Act. Certain genetically modified plants are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency are also required to determine the environmental impact of a proposed application under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). The process for plants is essentially one of issuing test permits and data dossiers for the product’s proposed use, followed by a process of de-regulation or approval if the application is found to be acceptable under the applicable regulations.
The regulatory process for food and animal feed is also based upon the Coordinated Framework, but the enabling legislation is the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, along with NEPA. In the case of animals for food or materials for feed, the FDA process is a pre-approval review followed by an approval if the application is acceptable under the relevant legislation.
We opened an Investigational New Animal Drug file for AquAdvantage Salmon with the FDA in 1995. At that time, there was no defined regulatory framework for the regulation of genetically engineered animals. There were, however, certain studies that were generally acknowledged to be necessary for an eventual approval process. We commenced work on those studies and began a phased submission of studies to the FDA that ultimately was responsive to each technical section of the NADA. These technical sections require submission of studies relating to molecular characterization of the construct; molecular characterization of AquAdvantage Salmon lineage; phenotypic characterization of AquAdvantage Salmon; a genotypic and phenotypic durability plan; support for environmental, food, and feed safety; and claim validation. The FDA’s phased review process, which included a cycle of study conduct, submission, review, and acceptance, continued over the period from 1995 to 2010. The following is a summary of certain submissions relating to the technical section of the NADA that we made to the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) during this period:

• | In August 2006, we submitted to the CVM the last correspondence for the review of the molecular characterization of the AquAdvantage construct. On October 6, 2006, we received a letter from the CVM stating “the data and information that you have submitted adequately supports the molecular characterization of the opAFP-GHc2 construct.”


• | In May 2007, we submitted to the CVM the last correspondence for the review of the molecular characterization of the AquAdvantage Salmon lineage. On July 2, 2008, we received a letter from the CVM stating “[w]e have reviewed the data and information you have submitted in support of the molecular characterization of the genetically engineered (GE) salmon referred to as ‘AquAdvantage Salmon’ and find that it is adequate support to conclude the molecular characterization of the inserted rDNA construct and GE animal lineage step of our review.”


• | In July 2009, we submitted to the CVM the last of the correspondence for the review of AquAdvantage Salmon claim validation. On March 12, 2010, we received a letter from the CVM stating “[w]e have reviewed the data and information that you have submitted in support of the Claim Validation of the genetically engineered (GE) salmon referred to as ‘AquAdvantage Salmon’, and consider this section complete.”

• | In December 2009, we submitted to the CVM the last of the correspondence for the review of the phenotypic characterization of AquAdvantage Salmon. On June 4, 2010, we received a letter from the CVM stating “[w]e have reviewed the data and information that you have submitted in support of the phenotypic characterization of the genetically engineered (GE) salmon referred to as ‘AquAdvantage Salmon’ and find that it is adequate support to conclude the phenotypic characterization step of our review.”


• | In March 2010, we submitted to the CVM the final correspondence for the review of data submitted in support of the safety of food from AquAdvantage Salmon. On August 27, 2010, we received a letter from the CVM stating “[w]e have reviewed the data and information that you have submitted in support of the food safety assessment of food from the genetically engineered (GE) salmon referred to as ‘AquAdvantage Salmon’ and find that it is adequate to conclude our evaluation of food safety.”


• | In April 2010, we submitted to the CVM the last of the correspondence for the review of the genotypic and phenotypic durability of AquAdvantage Salmon. On June 11, 2010, we received a letter from the CVM stating “[w]e have reviewed the data and information that you have submitted in support of the Genotypic and Phenotypic Durability of the genetically engineered (GE) salmon referred to as ‘AquAdvantage Salmon’ and find that you have adequately supported the Genotypic and Phenotypic Durability step of our review.”

By the spring of 2010, we had submitted to the FDA data for each technical submission requirement for approval under the NADA. By the fall of 2010, we had received from the FDA technical section complete letters for each submission requirement.
Following this process, the FDA concluded that AquAdvantage Salmon “is as safe as food from [conventional] salmon, and that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from consumption of food” from AquAdvantage Salmon.
In September 2010, the FDA held a public meeting of its Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (the “VMAC”) to review the FDA’s findings regarding AquAdvantage Salmon. The VMAC, which was disbanded in September 2013, was a group of independent experts charged with providing scientific advice to the FDA on animal drug and food issues. The VMAC had no authoritative power regarding the approval of the NADA but was convened to listen to the results of the FDA review process and to provide an outside opinion on the FDA’s conclusions. At the public meeting, the FDA posed four questions to the VMAC relating to the safety and effectiveness of AquAdvantage Salmon, including safety to the animal, safety of consumption, safety to the environment, and effectiveness of the growth gene. The Chairman’s Report of the VMAC relating to the public meeting stated that (1) the VMAC found no evidence to conclude that the gene construct was unsafe to the animal; (2) a large number of the test results studied by the VMAC established similarities and equivalence between AquAdvantage Salmon and traditional Atlantic salmon and that the levels of growth hormone contained in AquAdvantage Salmon did not appear to be biologically relevant from a food safety standpoint, although the VMAC noted that it could not conclude from the data submitted that AquAdvantage Salmon would be more or less allergenic than traditional Atlantic salmon; (3) the multitude of barriers to escape of AquAdvantage Salmon at both our Prince Edward Island and Panama facilities were extensive, mitigating the potential environmental impact of escape; and (4) there was evidence to support our claim that AquAdvantage Salmon grows faster than traditional Atlantic salmon. The VMAC did not vote or make a recommendation on whether to approve the NADA, and certain members of the panel recommended additional monitoring to determine whether the growing conditions could cause health abnormalities. While the FDA is not bound by the VMAC’s recommendations or opinions, the VMAC did not dispute the FDA’s conclusions that AquAdvantage Salmon is safe for human consumption.
On December 26, 2012, the FDA published its Environmental Assessment (“EA”) and its preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”) determinations for AquAdvantage Salmon, confirming that an approval of the pending NADA would not have an adverse effect on the environment. The FDA opened up a 60-day period for public comment on the EA and preliminary FONSI. On February 14, 2013, the FDA extended the period for public comment by an additional 60 days, and that period expired April 26, 2013.
In July 2014, we submitted to the FDA revised label and package insert information, which updated label and package insert information that we initially submitted to the FDA in April 2011. The submission of revised label and package insert information was in response to a June 2014 request from the FDA to revise and update the initial submission. Under the NADA review process, we were required to submit to the FDA from time to time information responsive to an “all other information” portion of the NADA, which requires the submission of information, not included in any of the technical sections, that comes to our attention and is pertinent to an evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of AquAdvantage Salmon. We submitted our last supplement to the “all other information” portion of the NADA on July 15, 2015, and the FDA formally acknowledged its acceptance of this submission on November 18, 2015.
On November 19, 2015, the FDA finalized the FONSI on the EA and issued an approval letter for the NADA for AquAdvantage Salmon. This approval was published in the Federal Register on November 24, 2015. In conjunction with the approval, the FDA issued a guidance document on the voluntary labeling of food derived from Atlantic salmon that has or has not been genetically engineered. That document was intended to assist those manufacturers who wish to voluntarily make the distinction on the labeling of their food products.

Following the FDA approval, in April 2016, a coalition of NGOs sued the FDA for their approval of AquAdvantage Salmon. The NGOs claim that the FDA failed to analyze and prevent risks to wild salmon and the environment. Among other things, the claimants are seeking a judgment that the FDA decision to approve AquAdvantage Salmon is not authorized by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”); that an injunction be issued requiring the FDA to withdraw its assertion of jurisdiction over genetically modified organism (“GMO”) animals; that the FDA decision to approve AquAdvantage Salmon and it EA and FONSI be declared in violation of the FFDCA; and that the decision to approve the AquAdvantage Salmon NADA be vacated. Although we believe that these claims lack merit, this legal action is ongoing and is currently in the discovery phase.
In January 2016, the U.S. Congress passed the 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act (“Appropriations Act”), which was signed into law. The Appropriations Act contained an amendment that directed the FDA to issue final guidance for labeling of AquAdvantage Salmon as a GMO, despite the absence of any GMO labeling requirement in the FDA’s NADA approval. Current FDA policy does not require labeling for method of production if there is no material difference compared with its traditional counterpart, and the FDA arrived at the decision that AquAdvantage Salmon is as safe to eat, and as nutritious, as any non-genetically engineered Atlantic salmon. However, given this directive, the FDA issued an Import Alert on AquAdvantage Salmon and stated that a temporary hold was being implemented to comply with language in the Appropriations Act, which was due to expire on September 30, 2016, but which was extended through a series of continuing resolutions to March 23, 2018. At this time, there can be no certainty as to when or if the Import Alert will be lifted or when the FDA will finalize its labeling guidance.
In addition to FDA approval of the NADA for AquAdvantage Salmon, our operating sites in the United States and Panama and on Prince Edward Island, as well as those we plan to build or purchase in the future, must be registered with, and periodically inspected by, the FDA as drug manufacturing establishments. Drug manufacturing establishments that supply FDA-regulated products for use in the United States must comply with the product’s conditions for approval, whether located in the United States or in a foreign country. Each of our Panama and Prince Edward Island operating sites is currently registered with the FDA, and the FDA has performed inspections and site visits at each facility. Our new facilities in Albany, Indiana, and in Rollo Bay, Prince Edward Island, will require FDA inspection and registration as drug manufacturing establishments.
With the FDA approval of our NADA, we must continue to comply with FDA requirements not only for manufacturing, but also for labeling, advertising, record keeping, and reporting to the FDA of adverse events and other information. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to administrative or judicial enforcement actions, including but not limited to product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, refusals to approve new products, or withdrawal of existing approvals, as well as increased product liability exposure.
Other Regulatory Approvals
In February 2012, we filed a Novel Food application for AquAdvantage Salmon with Health Canada. In conjunction with this application, we filed to register AquAdvantage Salmon as a Novel Feed with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, a prerequisite for a Novel Food approval. Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reviewed our data submission on the safety of AquAdvantage Salmon as a food and feed, respectively. On May 19, 2016, Health Canada concluded that AquAdvantage Salmon does not raise concerns related to food safety. Health Canada also noted in its opinion that fillets derived from AquAdvantage Salmon are as safe and nutritious as fillets from currently available farmed Atlantic salmon.
In April 2013, we filed a New Substances Notification for AquAdvantage Salmon with Environment Canada. On November 25, 2013, Environment Canada concluded that AquAdvantage Salmon is not harmful to the environment or human health when produced in contained facilities. This ruling, which was subject to a judicial review brought about by certain environmental groups on administrative procedural grounds, recognized that our Canadian hatchery, which produces sterile, all-female eggs, was no longer solely a research facility but could produce eggs on a commercial scale without harm to the environment or human health. In December 2015, the Federal Court in Canada ruled that the Ministers of Environment and Health decision to allow production of AquAdvantage Salmon in Canada for commercial use was “reasonable and made in the manner prescribed by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.” Accordingly, the court dismissed the entire application brought before it by the Ecology Action Centre and Living Oceans Society. This ruling was appealed by those organizations, but the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on October 21, 2016.
We are required to comply with regulatory and permitting requirements in Panama, where we operate a demonstration farm for AquAdvantage Salmon. In November 2010, we received authority from Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente (“ANAM”), the Panamanian environmental regulator, to operate our facility in Panama. In March 2012, we were notified by ANAM that we had failed to comply with specified permitting, inspection, reporting, and other regulatory requirements in connection with the construction and operation of the facility. We initiated a program to remedy the deficiencies, and the issues were formally resolved in August 2014. We paid a fine of $9,500 in connection with the resolution of these issues, and the matter is now closed. We currently have all regulatory approvals necessary to operate our demonstration farm in Panama and we have obtained, and are in compliance in all material respects with, all permits necessary to operate that facility. We have moved forward with an application for the commercial production, sale, and consumption of AquAdvantage Salmon in Panama. This application process is new, and we do not have information on when, or if, the application will be approved. However, in June 2017, we received approval from the National Biosafety Commission in Panama for the production, harvest and export of AquAdvantage Salmon.

We have also received approval from regulators to conduct field trials for AquAdvantage Salmon in Argentina and Brazil, and those trials are currently on-going. We intend to initiate additional regulatory filings outside the United States in selected markets that offer a clear regulatory path and market opportunity.
Grow-out of AquAdvantage Salmon in the United States will require compliance with environmental regulations and local site permitting statutes. In addition, every production site for AquAdvantage Salmon in the United States will require approval by the FDA of both a Supplemental NADA and a site-specific EA, as well as compliance with local permitting requirements for construction of grow-out facilities. We expect that we will incur costs to comply with these environmental and regulatory requirements, which could take several years to complete for each production site. We are currently unable to estimate these costs, but they may be significant.
Raw Materials
We previously sourced the unfertilized eggs that we use for internal research and trials of our AquAdvantage Salmon eggs from a Canadian supplier. After our FDA approval, we purchased a salmon farm near our hatchery on Prince Edward Island to maintain our own source of unfertilized eggs. We are currently constructing a broodstock facility on this site, which, when completed and at full capacity, will provide sufficient fertilized AquAdvantage Salmon eggs to satisfy our production requirements for at least the next five years.
Intellectual Property
The AquAdvantage fish program is based upon a single, specific molecular modification in fish that results in more rapid growth in early development. This enables shorter production cycles and increased efficiency of production. Prior to February 2014, we were a party to a license agreement with Genesis Group, Inc., an affiliate of Memorial University of Newfoundland (“Genesis”), and an affiliate of the Hospital for Sick Children of Toronto (“HSC”) related to our transgenic fish program. Under the terms of this agreement, we were required to make an annual royalty payment of $25 thousand or revenue-based royalty payments equal to five percent of any gross revenues generated from products that utilize the technology covered under the license agreement. No revenue-based royalty payments were made under this agreement. The patent for the licensed technology, which had been issued in certain salmon producing countries, expired in August 2013. In February 2014, we entered into a new license agreement with Genesis and HSC that replaced the prior license agreement. Under the new agreement, we hold a global, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sub-licensable, assignable, non-exclusive right to the technology covering genetically modified salmonid fish that express endogenous growth hormone under the control of a protein gene promoter from an edible fish. In consideration for this license, we agreed to pay to Genesis a one-time payment of $140 thousand, which amount was paid on March 6, 2014, but no additional patents are contemplated under this agreement. Despite the expiration of the patent for the licensed technology, we believe that the degree of know-how in the molecular modification process and the regulatory timescales associated with approval of genetically modified fish would present significant barriers to competition.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes, and brand. In December 2015, we were granted a U.S. patent for our molecular sterility system, which renders sterile the progeny of any female fish carrying a defined maternal sterility gene. While the technology described in the sterility system patent is not currently used nor required under any of our current regulatory approvals, the technology may be desirable in the future to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals.
Patents for this technology have been granted regarding our rights to use certain technologies under the ECC with Intrexon. For more information, see the section of this 10-K titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement.”
For information regarding our rights to use certain technologies under the ECC with Intrexon, see “—Research and Development.”
Seasonality
Atlantic salmon spawn once per year, so there is a natural seasonality of three to five months in the production of Atlantic salmon eggs for commercial use. This natural seasonality can be lengthened through the use of photoperiod techniques to make Atlantic salmon eggs available year-round. We are not currently capable of producing AquAdvantage Salmon eggs on a year-round basis. Currently, we produce AquAdvantage Salmon eggs during the period of January through April of each year. We expect that, with the establishment of our new broodstock facility at our Rollo Bay farm site on Prince Edward Island, we will be able to produce AquAdvantage Salmon eggs year-round.
Competition
There are four major commercial salmonid breeding companies that market proprietary lines of Atlantic salmon eggs, as well as many small producers of salmonid eggs. Additionally, many of the largest Atlantic salmon producers maintain their own egg production capabilities. We do not believe, however, that we have a direct competitor for genetically modified, growth-enhanced Atlantic salmon eggs.
8

The industry and market for farmed Atlantic salmon is dominated by a group of large, multinational corporations with entrenched distribution channels, as discussed in the section of this 10-K titled “Business-The Aquaculture Industry-Major Producers.” While we do not believe that we have a direct competitor for genetically modified, growth-enhanced Atlantic salmon, we do believe that our product will need to compete with non-genetically modified salmon.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2017, we had nineteen employees dedicated to research and development. Our primary research and development operations are located in our owned hatchery on Prince Edward Island. In addition, we contract some research activities to the Center for Aquaculture Technologies, Inc., our former research group, which was spun-off and sold to Tethys in 2012. We incurred expenses of $3.4 million in 2017, $3.4 million in 2016, and $3.3 million in 2015 on research and development activities.
In February 2013, we entered into the ECC with Intrexon pursuant to which we are permitted to use Intrexon’s UltraVector® and other technology platforms to develop and commercialize additional genetically modified traits in finfish for human consumption. The ECC grants us a worldwide license to use certain patents and other intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture, sale, and offer for sale of products involving DNA administered to finfish for human consumption. This license is exclusive with respect to any development, selling, offering for sale, or other commercialization of developed products, and otherwise is non-exclusive. Under the ECC and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, the performance of the program, including development, commercialization, and certain aspects of manufacturing developed products. Among other things, Intrexon is responsible for the costs of establishing manufacturing capabilities and facilities for the bulk manufacture of certain products developed under the program; certain other aspects of manufacturing; costs of discovery-stage research with respect to platform improvements; and costs of filing, prosecution, and maintenance of Intrexon’s patents. We agreed to pay Intrexon, on a quarterly basis, 16.66% of the gross profits calculated for each developed product. We also agreed to pay Intrexon 50% of the quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensee in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. In addition, we agreed to reimburse Intrexon for the costs of certain services provided by Intrexon.
Since its execution in February 2013, we and Intrexon have commenced development on two projects under the ECC, both of which are in their early stages. The first project, which commenced in June 2013, is a research effort to determine the effectiveness of utilizing precise genome engineering technology to produce desirable features in a finfish. The second project, which commenced in September 2013, is a research effort to determine if the use of germ cells to perform gene modification is effective in reducing the time required to develop new traits in finfish. If these technology-enabling projects prove to be successful, they will allow us to add additional beneficial traits to AquAdvantage Salmon.
In addition to the projects being undertaken under the ECC, we are exploring the potential development of a range of additional products, including a second generation of AquAdvantage Salmon to ensure 100% sterility, a line of AquAdvantage® Trout that grows faster than traditional rainbow trout, molecular sterility systems to provide an improved means of sterility for farmed fish, infection control in shrimp, and improved methods for generating transgenic fish.
Our research and development expenditures are directly tied to the number of projects that we choose to undertake. We expect to increase our development efforts as we commence additional projects either in-house or under our ECC with Intrexon. We expect that these projects could result in an increase in our research and development expenditures in the range of 5% to 10% per year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had thirty-seven employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
Our corporate headquarters are located in Maynard, Massachusetts, and consist of approximately 3,500 square feet of office space under a lease that expires in March 2023. We operate a demonstration farm for AquAdvantage Salmon in Panama under a lease that expires in May 2018. On Prince Edward Island, Canada, we own both a hatchery in Fortune and a salmon farm, consisting of a hatchery, a grow-out facility, and a broodstock facility, in Rollo Bay, and we own a production grow-out facility in Albany, Indiana. We believe that the spaces that we lease and own are sufficient to meet our current and near-term needs.
Recent Events
Our common stock was listed on AIM, the London Stock Exchange’s international market for smaller growing companies, from 2006 through May 31, 2017, initially under the symbol “ABTX” and, commencing in 2014, under the symbol “ABTU.” On January 19, 2017, our common stock began “regular way” trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and, effective June 1, 2017, we voluntarily delisted our common stock from AIM.
On January 18, 2017, we sold 2,421,073 shares of our common stock to Intrexon, our controlling shareholder, for proceeds of approximately $25 million. Following the closing of this sale, Intrexon distributed 1,776,557 shares of our common stock that it held prior to the closing via a share dividend to its shareholders.
9

On January 17, 2018, we completed a public offering of 3,692,307 shares of our common stock and 4,246,153 warrants for net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million. Intrexon participated in this offering, purchasing 1,538,461 shares of our common stock and warrants for $5 million.
Management is evaluating several paths to revenue generation that follow different timelines, including production of our fish at our existing farm sites in Panama, Indiana, Rollo Bay, and additional facilities in North America; sale of AquAdvantage Salmon eggs to Atlantic salmon farmers; and partnerships or licensing agreements. Depending on which path or combination of paths is chosen, we expect only modest revenues during 2018, with more significant revenues once our Indiana and Rollo Bay facilities are in full production.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as amended by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) enacted on April 5, 2012. For as long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”); an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies; an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) that require mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors’ report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation not previously approved.
Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700.0 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the issuance, in any three-year period, by our company of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (4) December 31, 2023, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.
