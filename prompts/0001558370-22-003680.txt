Item 1. Business.

Introduction
Formed as a Delaware corporation in 1987, Full House Resorts, Inc. owns, leases, operates, develops, manages, and/or invests in casinos and related hospitality and entertainment facilities. References in this document to “Full House,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Full House Resorts, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where stated or the context otherwise indicates.
The Company currently operates five casinos: four on real estate that we own or lease and one located within a hotel owned by a third party. Construction continues for a sixth property, Chamonix Casino Hotel (“Chamonix”), adjacent to our existing Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado. We also benefit from six permitted sports wagering “skins,” three in Colorado and three in Indiana. Other companies operate or will operate these online sports wagering sites under their brands, paying us a percentage of revenues, as defined, subject to annual minimum amounts.
In December 2021, we were selected to develop our “American Place” project in Waukegan, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. We intend to open a temporary casino facility named The Temporary by American Place (“The Temporary”) in Summer 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. We expect to operate The Temporary until the opening of the permanent American Place facility and intend to include such operations as its own segment, Illinois. We also expect to receive one sports skin in Illinois upon the opening of The Temporary.
The following table presents selected information concerning our casino resort properties as of December 31, 2021:

We manage our casinos based primarily on geographic regions within the United States. Our 2021 results reflect a change in our operating segments. We now break out our on-site and online sports wagering skins in Colorado and Indiana as a standalone segment, Contracted Sports Wagering. Certain reclassifications were made to 2020 amounts to conform to current-period presentation for enhanced comparability. Such reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported results of operations or financial position. Our corporate headquarters is in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Our mission is to maximize stockholder value, while also being good employers and community participants. We seek to increase revenues by providing our customers with their favorite games and amenities, high-quality customer service, and appropriate customer loyalty programs. Our customers include nearby residents who represent a high potential for repeat visits, along with drive-in tourist patrons. We continuously focus on improving the operating results of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management efforts. The casino resort industry is capital-intensive, and we rely on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to pay interest, repay debt, and fund maintenance and certain growth-related capital expenditures. We also continually assess the potential impact of growth and development opportunities, including capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties.
Our casino properties generally operate 24 hours each day, 365 days per year. We also operate the hotel, food and beverage, and other on-site operations at Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel (“Silver Slipper”), Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel (“Bronco Billy’s”), Rising Star Casino Resort (“Rising Star”) and Stockman’s Casino (“Stockman’s”), as well as a golf course, recreational vehicle (RV) park and ferry service at Rising Star and an RV park at Silver Slipper. At Grand Lodge Casino (“Grand Lodge”), the adjoining hotel and the food and beverage outlets are managed by Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino (“Hyatt Lake Tahoe”).


Operating Properties
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel (Hancock County, Mississippi)
The Silver Slipper is the western-most casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, midway between Biloxi, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana. The property sits at the western end of an approximately eight-mile-long white sand beach, the closest such beach to the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. Its customers are primarily from communities in southwestern Mississippi and southern Louisiana, including the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain and the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. In addition to its large, modern casino, the Silver Slipper offers 129 hotel rooms or suites, an on-site sportsbook, a fine-dining restaurant, a buffet, a quick-service restaurant, an oyster bar, a casino bar and a beachfront pool and bar. The Silver Slipper currently generates the most revenue and operating income of any of our properties. 
The primary lease for the Silver Slipper includes approximately 38 acres, consisting of the seven-acre parcel on which the casino and hotel is situated and approximately 31 acres of protected marshlands. The lease term ends in April 2058. From April 1, 2022 through October 1, 2027, we have the option to buy out the lease.
We also manage a nearby 37-space beachfront RV park under a management contract, which expires on March 31, 2025, unless canceled by either party with prior notice of 180 days.
Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel (Cripple Creek, Colorado)
Bronco Billy’s is located in Cripple Creek, Colorado, a historical gold mining town located approximately one hour southwest of Colorado Springs and two hours from Denver. Its customers are primarily from the Colorado Springs/Pueblo/Cañon City metropolitan area, the second-largest metropolitan area in Colorado, with a population of approximately 900,000 residents. Its secondary market, the Denver metropolitan area, has a population of approximately four million people. Bronco Billy’s occupies a significant portion of the key city block of Cripple Creek’s “casino strip.” In addition to gaming space, it currently offers 14 hotel rooms, a steakhouse, and a casual dining outlet. Bronco Billy’s owns much of its real estate, but also leases certain parking lots and buildings, including a portion of the hotel and casino, under a long-term lease. The lease has six renewal options in three-year increments through January 2035, and we have the right to buy out the lease at any time during its term. We also commenced a three-year lease in August 2018 for a key corner on our block that was subsequently extended through August 2023, which also includes an option to buy out the lease.

We are allowed to offer online sports wagering through three sports “skins” in Colorado. Rather than operate these sports skins ourselves, we contracted with three companies to operate such skins under their own brands in exchange for a percentage of revenues, as defined in each contract, subject to annual minimum amounts paid to us. For Colorado, the sum of the minimum annual amounts is $3.5 million. If our percentage-share of sports revenue exceeds our contractual minimums, then we should receive in excess of $3.5 million on an annualized basis. We incur minimal expenses related to these revenues. As of December 31, 2021, all three of our skins had begun operations. However, one of our three skin operators subsequently informed us of their intent to cease operations on May 15, 2022. We are currently negotiating with other companies to be the replacement operator for such skin, though there can be no guarantee that any replacement contract will be entered into on similar terms or at all.

Chamonix Casino Hotel (Cripple Creek, Colorado)
In 2018, we began planning and design work on Chamonix, a new and distinct, luxury hotel and casino, to be located adjacent to Bronco Billy’s in Cripple Creek. Following changes made to the state’s gaming laws in November 2020, including the elimination of betting limits and the approval of new table games, we increased the size of Chamonix by 67% to approximately 300 luxury guest rooms and suites, from our previously planned 180 guest rooms. Such plans were approved by the Cripple Creek Historic Preservation Commission and Cripple Creek City Council in January and February 2021. Our construction budget for Chamonix is approximately $250 million. To fund such construction, on February 12, 2021 we issued $310 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and placed a portion of such proceeds into a restricted cash account dedicated to Chamonix’s construction (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). We expect to open Chamonix in the second quarter of 2023.
Rising Star Casino Resort (Rising Sun, Indiana)
Rising Star is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. In addition to its casino, Rising Star offers a land-based pavilion with approximately 31,500 square feet of meeting and convention space, a contiguous 190-guest-room hotel, an adjacent leased 104-guest-room hotel set on three acres, a 56-space RV park, four dining outlets, surface parking and an 18-hole golf course on over 230 acres. The 104-guest-room hotel is leased pursuant to an agreement that expires in October 2027 and contains a bargain purchase option, whereby we have the right to purchase the hotel and the landlord has the right to put the hotel to us, in both cases for $1 if exercised upon maturity of the lease. We also own 1.3 acres located in Burlington, Kentucky that is used as part of our ferry boat operations, as further described below.
We have completed several capital projects in recent years. In 2018, we renovated the entry pavilion and the adjoining hotel’s lobby and hallways. We also commenced operations of a ferry boat service that connects the more populous Boone County, Kentucky to our Rising Star property in Indiana. In the second half of 2019, we renovated and rebranded a casual restaurant as “Ben’s Bistro.”
We are allowed to offer online sports wagering through three sports “skins” in Indiana. As in Colorado, we contracted with three companies to operate such skins under their own brands in exchange for a percentage of revenues, as defined in each contract, subject to annual minimum amounts. The sum of the minimum annual amounts in Indiana is $3.5 million with minimal expected expenses, so that the total between the six contracts and two states is $7 million per year. If our percentage-share of sports revenue exceeds our contractual minimums in one or more contracts, then we should receive in excess of $7 million on an annualized basis. As of December 31, 2021, all three of our skins in Indiana were contractually live, with the last skin subsequently receiving gaming approval on February 28, 2022. However, one of our three skin operators subsequently informed us of their intent to cease operations on May 15, 2022. We are currently negotiating with other companies to be the replacement operator for such skin, though there can be no guarantee that any replacement contract will be entered into on similar terms or at all.

Stockman’s Casino (Fallon, Nevada)
Stockman’s is located in Churchill County, Nevada, approximately one hour from Reno, Nevada. Stockman’s primarily serves the local market of Fallon and surrounding areas, including the nearby Naval Air Station, which is the Navy’s premier air training facility, informally referred to as the “Top Gun” school. In addition to its casino, Stockman’s offers a bar, fine-dining restaurant and coffee shop. In 2018, we completed numerous external improvements to the property, including a new porte cochère. In late 2019, we completed a significant renovation and rebranding of the Stockman’s steakhouse.
Grand Lodge Casino (Incline Village, Nevada)
We operate Grand Lodge at the Hyatt Lake Tahoe under a lease with Incline Hotel, LLC. Grand Lodge is located within the Hyatt Lake Tahoe in Incline Village, Nevada on the north shore of Lake Tahoe and includes approximately 20,990 square feet of leased space. The Hyatt Lake Tahoe is one of three AAA Four Diamond hotels in the Lake Tahoe area. Our casino’s customers consist of both locals and tourists visiting the Lake Tahoe area.
Our lease with Incline Hotel, LLC is set to expire in August 2023, but we own the personal property, including slot machines. The lease is secured by our interests under such lease, consisting of certain collateral (as defined and described in a security agreement), and is subordinate to the Notes. The landlord currently has an option to purchase our leasehold interest and operating assets of the Grand Lodge Casino at a defined price based partially on earnings.


American Place, Including The Temporary (Waukegan, Illinois)
In December 2021, we were chosen by the Illinois Gaming Board (“IGB”) to develop American Place, a new gaming and entertainment destination located in Waukegan, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, subject to final regulatory approvals. Waukegan has a population of approximately 89,000 and is the county seat of Lake County, which has a population of approximately 714,000. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Lake County has a median household income of approximately $89,000 and is also the third most populous county in the state.
​
The permanent American Place facility is slated to include a world-class casino with a state-of-the-art sports book; a premium boutique hotel comprised of 20 luxurious villas, each ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet with full butler service; a 1,500-seat live entertainment venue; a gourmet restaurant that will rival the finest restaurants in Chicago; additional eateries and bars; and other amenities that will attract gaming and non-gaming patrons from throughout Chicagoland and beyond.
​
While the larger, more lavish, permanent facility is under construction, we will operate a temporary casino facility, aptly named The Temporary by American Place. The Temporary is slated to include approximately 1,000 slot machines, 50 table games, a fine-dining restaurant, two additional restaurants, and a center bar. We intend to open The Temporary in Summer 2022, pending customary regulatory approvals.
​
In preparation for the opening of The Temporary, we recently agreed to purchase a “Sprung structure,” which encloses an area of approximately 1.5 football fields and will house most of the temporary casino. The Sprung structure is expected to arrive on-site in April 2022. Additionally, we recently entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 10 acres of land adjoining the approximately 30-acre casino site to be leased from the city, providing space for additional parking and access to the casino site from a major road.
On February 7, 2022, we closed a private offering of $100 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes were sold at a price of 102.0% of the principal amount and were issued pursuant to an indenture under which we previously issued for the 2028 Notes on February 12, 2021 (collectively, the “Notes”). Also on February 7, 2022, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility agreement to, among other things, increase our borrowing capacity from $15 million to $40 million (the “Credit Facility”), all of which remains undrawn as of this report date (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility, based on today’s rates, would be less than 4%.

Government Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations and include, without limitation, the following conditions and restrictions:

● | Periodic license fees and taxes must be paid to state and local gaming authorities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Certain officers, directors, key employees, and gaming employees are required to be licensed or otherwise approved by the gaming authorities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Individuals who must be approved by the gaming authorities must submit comprehensive personal disclosure forms and undergo an extensive background investigation, the costs for which must be borne by the applicant;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes in any licensed or approved individuals must be reported to and/or approved by the relevant gaming authority;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Failure to timely file the required application forms by any individual required to be approved by the relevant gaming authority may result in that individual’s denial and the gaming licensee may be required by the gaming authority to disassociate with that individual; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If any individual is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, the gaming licensee is required to disassociate with that individual.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Violations of gaming laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A summary of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
Our businesses are also subject to other various federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for additional discussion.
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our Indiana property is subject to environmental regulations for its riverboat, ferry boat and golf club operations. Our Mississippi property is located near environmental wetlands. In Colorado and Illinois, we are building major new casino hotels and such construction must also adhere to certain environmental regulations. Our Colorado facilities, for example, are in historical mining areas. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of the property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, and may also incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent the property. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, we cannot assure you that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.

Competition
The gaming industry is highly competitive. Gaming activities with which we compete include traditional commercial casinos and casino resorts in various states including on tribal lands and at racetracks, state-sponsored lotteries, video poker in restaurants, bars and hotels, pari-mutuel betting on horse and dog racing and jai alai, sports betting and card rooms. We also face competition from Internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other Internet gaming services, beyond those in which we participate. Internet gaming services allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings. Although there is no meaningful evidence to date that this has been the case, this could divert customers from our properties, and thus, adversely affect our business. All of our casinos, as well as other casinos that we may develop or acquire, compete with all these forms of gaming. We also compete with any new forms or jurisdictions of gaming that may be legalized, as well as with other types of entertainment. Some of our competitors have more personnel and greater financial or other resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are: location, with casinos located closer to the feeder markets at an advantage; casino, lodging, entertainment and other hospitality product quality in terms of facilities, customer service and ease of access; breadth of offerings, including the types of casino games and other non-gaming amenities; and marketing, including the amount, quality, and frequency of promotions offered to guests.
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel
Silver Slipper is in Mississippi, but is close to the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain, one of the most affluent and fastest-growing regions in Louisiana. Louisiana law permits 15 riverboat casinos, one land-based casino, four casinos at racetracks, and in certain areas, a limited number of slot machines at qualifying truck stops. The legislation permitting riverboat and truck stop casinos requires a local referendum. At this time, all licenses for riverboat casinos in Louisiana have been granted and only one of such casinos is not currently in operation. In 2021, the owners of the closed casino attempted to move their gaming license from Bossier City to Slidell, Louisiana. Such efforts were not successful, as voters rejected the casino referendum by a vote of 63% to 37%. Mississippi does not have a limitation on the number of casino licenses, but requires casinos to be within approximately 800 feet of the Mississippi River shoreline or the Gulf of Mexico, as defined by state law. There are occasionally proposals to relocate casinos within Louisiana or to develop new casinos in Mississippi, but there are considerable political and economic constraints on such potential competition. Management does not believe such efforts will be successful in the foreseeable future.
Bronco Billy’s Casino and Hotel and Chamonix Casino Hotel
Bronco Billy’s and Chamonix are located in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is a historical gold mining town located approximately one hour southwest of Colorado Springs, on the west side of Pikes Peak. Cripple Creek is one of only three cities in Colorado where commercial gaming is permitted. The other two cities adjoin each other and are approximately one hour west of Denver. Downtown Denver and Colorado Springs are approximately 70 miles apart and certain suburbs of each metropolitan area largely merge into the other. Two Native American gaming operations exist in southwestern Colorado and there are tribal casinos in Oklahoma, but these are much further from Colorado Springs and Denver than Cripple Creek. There are no federally-recognized Native American tribes in the Colorado Front Range, which includes Denver and Colorado Springs. As of December 31, 2021, Bronco Billy’s was one of seven gaming facilities operating in Cripple Creek. One of those competitors added a 100-guest-room hotel in 2021. Chamonix, which is currently under construction, will be significantly larger and is planned to be higher in quality than any of the existing casinos in Cripple Creek.
Rising Star Casino Resort
Rising Star Casino Resort is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. One of three riverboat casinos in southeastern Indiana, its closest competitors are each approximately 15 miles away, near bridges crossing the Ohio River. There is no bridge at Rising Star, but in September 2018, we commenced a ferry boat service connecting Rising Sun, Indiana, to the populous Northern Kentucky region. Rising Star also competes with a large casino near Louisville, which completed a significant investment to transition from a dockside riverboat casino to a new land-based casino in December 2019; casinos in Ohio and elsewhere in Indiana; and slot parlors associated with racetracks in Kentucky. In January 2020, the racetrack casinos near Indianapolis, which were previously limited to slot machines, began offering live table games.

Stockman’s Casino
Stockman’s Casino is the largest of several casinos in Churchill County, Nevada, which has a population of approximately 25,000 residents. Churchill County is also the home of Naval Air Station Fallon, the United States Navy’s premier air training facility, informally referred to as the “Top Gun” school. While the Navy appears to be expanding its base in Fallon, a reduction of its activities at the base would likely have an adverse effect on Stockman’s results of operations. Fallon is approximately 30 minutes east of the large Tesla battery factory and other developments in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. Stockman’s also competes with casinos in other rural communities in the area, as well as with casinos in Reno, some of which are significantly larger and offer more amenities.
Grand Lodge Casino
Grand Lodge is located in Incline Village, Nevada, and is one of four casinos located within a five-mile radius in the North Lake Tahoe area.
Grand Lodge Casino also competes with casinos in South Lake Tahoe and Reno. There are also numerous Native American casinos in California serving the Northern California market.
American Place and The Temporary
American Place will compete against two existing casinos which primarily serve the suburbs north of Chicago, a tribal casino in Milwaukee, and slot machines in bars (limited to six machines per bar) in many parts of Illinois. It will be the only full-service casino in Lake County, Illinois, which has a population of approximately 714,000 residents. Including areas neighboring Lake County, we estimate that American Place will be the closest casino to more than 1.0 million individuals. American Place is also designed to offer more, and better, amenities than any other casino operating today in Illinois.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our customer loyalty programs and specialized marketing campaigns, such as our seasonal “Christmas Casino” event at Rising Star Casino Resort. We advertise through various channels, including radio, television, Internet, billboards, newspapers and magazines, direct mail, email and social media. We also maintain websites to inform customers about our properties and utilize social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals. Our customer loyalty programs include the Slipper Rewards Club, the Bronco Billy’s Mile High Rewards Club, the Rising Star VIP Club, the Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club®, and the Stockman’s Winner’s Club. Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as “free play,” complimentary dining, and hotel stays.
Our properties do not have coordinated loyalty programs, due to the disparate locations of our properties. Instead, our loyalty programs focus on providing each casino’s customers the amenities they most prefer in each market.
Intellectual Property
We use a variety of trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use certain trademarks, patents and copyrights that are material to conduct our business.
