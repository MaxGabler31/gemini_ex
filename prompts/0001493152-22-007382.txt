Item 1. Business
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sigyn” or the “Company”) is a development-stage therapeutic technology company headquartered in San Diego, California USA. Our business focus is the clinical advancement of Sigyn Therapy, a multi-function blood purification technology designed to overcome the limitations of previous drugs and devices to treat life-threatening inflammatory disorders, including sepsis, the leading cause of hospital deaths worldwide.
About Sigyn Therapy – Candidate Treatment Indications
 
We are advancing Sigyn Therapy to treat pathogen-associated conditions that precipitate sepsis and other high-mortality disorders that are not addressed with approved drug therapies. To address these unmet therapeutic needs, we designed Sigyn Therapy to extract pathogen sources of life-threating inflammation from the bloodstream in concert with the depletion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whose dysregulated production (the cytokine storm) plays a prominent role in each of our therapeutic indication opportunities. 
 
In addition to sepsis, our candidate treatment indications include, but are not limited to; emerging pandemic threats, drug resistant pathogens, hepatic encephalopathy, bridge to liver transplant, and community-acquired pneumonia (“CAP”), which is a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, and a catalyst for approximately 50% of sepsis and septic shock cases.
 
Public Merger Agreement
 
On October 19, 2020, Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc, a Delaware corporation (the “Registrant”) formerly known as Reign Resources Corporation, completed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc., a private entity incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 19, 2019.
 
In the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of privately held Sigyn Therapeutics common stock in exchange for 75% of the fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock outstanding (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the transaction, we changed our name from Reign Resources Corporation to Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to an amendment to our articles of incorporation that was filed with the State of Delaware. Subsequently, our trading symbol was changed to SIGY. The Acquisition was treated as a “tax-free exchange” under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and resulted in the private Sigyn Therapeutics corporate entity becoming a wholly owned subsidiary known as Sigyn Medical Corporation. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, we appointed James A. Joyce and Craig P. Roberts to serve as members of our Board of Directors.
 
As of March 14, 2022, we have a total 37,295,803 shares issued and outstanding, of which 11,655,803 shares are held by non-affiliate shareholders.
 
Post Public Merger Developments
 
Since the consummation of our public merger on October 19, 2020, we have advanced Sigyn Therapy from conceptual design to clinical application. We initiated and completed six (6) in vitro blood plasma studies that have validated the ability of Sigyn Therapy to address a broad-spectrum of relevant therapeutic targets, including endotoxin (gram-negative bacterial toxin); peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid (gram-positive bacterial toxins); viral pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2); hepatic toxins (ammonia, bile acid, and bilirubin); CytoVesicles (extracellular vesicles that transport inflammatory cytokine cargos); and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are pro-inflammatory cytokines whose dysregulated production (the cytokine storm) precipitate sepsis and play a prominent role in each of our therapeutic opportunities.

Subsequent to these milestone achievements, we announced the completion of in vivo animal studies on February 23, 2022, that demonstrated Sigyn Therapy to be safe and well tolerated.
 
In the studies, Sigyn Therapy was administered via standard dialysis machines utilizing conventional blood-tubing sets, for periods of up to six hours in eight (8) porcine (pig) subjects, each weighing approximately 40-45 kilograms. The studies were comprised of a pilot phase (two subjects), which evaluated the feasibility of the study protocol in the first-in-mammal use of Sigyn Therapy; and an expansion phase (six subjects) to further assess treatment safety and refine pre-treatment set-up and operating procedures. Sigyn Therapy was well tolerated by all eight animal subjects and no serious adverse events were reported in any treated animal subject. Important criteria for treatment safety – including hemodynamic parameters, serum chemistries and hematologic measurements – were stable across all subjects.
 
The studies were conducted by a clinical team at Innovative BioTherapies, Inc. (“IBT”), under a contract with the University of Michigan to utilize animal care, associated institutional review oversight, as well as surgical suite facilities located within the North Campus Research Complex. IBT is uniquely experienced in providing development services that support the clinical advancement of extracorporeal devices. The treatment protocol of the study was reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
 
We plan to incorporate the data resulting from our in vivo and invitro studies into an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) that we are drafting for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to support the potential initiation of human clinical studies.
 
Sigyn Therapy Mechanism of Action
 
To overcome the limitations of previous drug and device therapies, we created Sigyn Therapy with a novel multi-function mechanism of action. Based on the results of studies conducted to date, our expansive mechanism establishes Sigyn Therapy as an emerging candidate to treat a wide-range of pathogen-associated conditions that precipitate sepsis and other life-threatening disorders.
 
To support widespread implementation, we designed Sigyn Therapy to be a single-use disposable device that is deployable on the global infrastructure of hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines already located in hospitals and clinics.
 
Incorporated with Sigyn Therapy is a “cocktail” of adsorbent components formulated to optimize the broad-spectrum extraction of therapeutic targets from the bloodstream. In the medical field, the term “cocktail” is a reference to the simultaneous administration of multiple drugs (a drug cocktail) with differing mechanisms of actions. While drug cocktails are emerging as potential mechanisms to treat cancer, they are proven life-saving countermeasures to treat HIV and Hepatitis-C viral infections. However, dosing of multi-drug agent cocktails is limited by toxicity and adverse events that can result from deleterious drug interactions.
 
Sigyn Therapy is not constrained by such limitations as our adsorbent components are not introduced into the body. As a result, we are able to incorporate a substantial dose of multiple adsorbents, each with differing mechanisms and capabilities to optimize Sigyn Therapy’s ability to address a broad-spectrum of pathogenic and inflammatory targets that precipitate the cytokine storm that underlies sepsis and other acute life-threatening disorders.
 
The adsorbent components that we incorporate in Sigyn Therapy provide more than 200,000 square meters (~50 acres) of surface area on which to adsorb and remove circulating pathogens, toxins, inflammatory mediators, and other relevant targets below 200nm in diameter. Beyond an immense capacity to remove therapeutic targets, Sigyn Therapy is also highly efficient. Based on blood flow rates of 350ml/min, a patient’s entire bloodstream can pass through Sigyn Therapy up to seventeen (17) times during a single four-hour treatment period.

Overview of Candidate Treatment Indications
 
Based on data resulting from in vitro blood purification studies, our candidate treatment indications include, but are not limited to; sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia, emerging pandemic threats, hepatic encephalopathy, bridge to liver transplant, and drug resistant pathogens. However, there is no assurance that controlled human studies will demonstrate Sigyn Therapy to be an efficacious treatment for any of these indications.
Sepsis
 
Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In January of 2020, a report entitled; “Global, Regional, and National Sepsis Incidence and Mortality, 1990-2017: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study,” was published in the Journal Lancet. The publication reported 48.9 million cases of sepsis and 11 million deaths in 2017. In that same year, an estimated 20.3 million sepsis cases and 2.9 million deaths were among children younger than 5-years old. The report included a reference that sepsis kills more people around the world than all forms of cancer combined. In the United States, sepsis was reported to be the most common cause of hospital deaths with an annual financial burden that exceeds $24 billion.
 
To date, more than 100 human studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs to treat sepsis. With one brief exception (Xigris, Eli Lilly), none of these studies resulted in a market cleared therapy.
 
As sepsis remains beyond the reach of single-target drugs, there is an emerging interest in multi-mechanism therapies that can target both inflammatory and pathogen associated targets. Sigyn Therapy addresses a broad-spectrum of pathogen sources and the resulting dysregulated cytokine production (the cytokine storm) that is the hallmark of sepsis. Additionally, we believe that inflammatory cytokine cargos transported by CytoVesicles may represent a novel, yet important therapeutic target.
 
Community-acquired Pneumonia 
 
CAP represents a significant opportunity for Sigyn Therapy to reduce the occurrence of sepsis. CAP is a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, and a catalyst for approximately 50% of sepsis and septic shock cases.
 
In the United States, more than 1.5 million individuals are hospitalized with CAP each year, resulting in an annual financial burden that exceeds $10 billion.
 
Statistically, a therapeutic strategy that reduced the incidence of CAP related sepsis and septic shock would save thousands of lives each year. In a study of 4,222 patients, the all-cause mortality for adult patients with CAP was reported to be 6.5% during hospitalization. However, the mortality of patients with CAP related sepsis and septic shock rose to 51% during hospitalization.
 
CAP is further complicated by the fact that the pathogen sources of CAP are identified in only 38% of patients, based on a study of 2,259 subjects whose pneumonia diagnosis was confirmed by chest x-ray. Of the source pathogens identified in the study, ninety seven percent (97%) were either viral or bacterial in origin.
 
To reduce the occurrence of CAP related sepsis and septic shock, Sigyn Therapy offers a broad-spectrum mechanism to reduce the circulating presence of viral pathogens and bacterial toxins before and if they are identified as the CAP pathogen source. Additionally, Sigyn Therapy may help to control the excess production of inflammatory cytokines (the cytokine storm) that precipitate sepsis and septic shock.
 
Emerging Pandemic Threats
 
Covid-19 affirmed the role of extracorporeal blood purification as a basis for first-line countermeasures to treat newly emerging viral threats, whose presence are increasingly being fueled by a confluence of global warming, urban crowding, and intercontinental travel.
 
On March 24, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the emergence of COVID-19 to justify the Emergency-Use Authorization (“EUA”) of drugs, biological products, and medical devices to combat the pandemic. The first four (4) therapies to receive EAU approval to treat COVID-19 were not antiviral drug or biological products, they were blood purification technologies.
 
In connection with these EUA awards, FDA published a statement that blood purification devices may be effective at treating certain patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reducing pathogens and inflammatory cytokines from the bloodstream.

Consistent with FDA’s statement, Sigyn Therapy has been validated to deplete circulating viral pathogens, including COVID-19, and inflammatory cytokines whose levels correlate with disease severity and increased mortality rates. Inversely, declining levels of these same inflammatory cytokines are associated with patient recovery.
 
As a majority of human viruses are not addressed with a corresponding drug or vaccine, there may also be an ongoing need for blood purification technologies that reduce the severity of infection and mitigate the excess production of inflammatory cytokines (the cytokine storm) associated with high mortality in non-pandemic viral infections. In this regard, we believe that Sigyn Therapy aligns with U.S. Government initiatives that support the development of broad-spectrum medical countermeasures that can mitigate the impact of emerging pandemic threats, yet also have viability in established disease indications.
 
Hepatic Encephalopathy 
 
Based on the results of invitro blood purification studies conducted to date, we consider Sigyn Therapy to be a compelling strategy to reverse the length and severity of Hepatic Encephalopathy (“HE”), a frequent and serious complication of both chronic liver disease and acute liver failure. A hallmark characteristic of HE is the accumulation of neurotoxic substances in the bloodstream that translocate through the blood-brain barrier, which can result in a hepatic coma in severe cases and ultimately cause death.
 
The three-year survival rate following the first episode of HE is approximately 15%. The clinical and economic burden of HE is considerable as it contributes to an impaired quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. In the United States, HE is a significant public health concern that results in 100,000–115,000 yearly hospital admissions.
 
The severity of Hepatic Encephalopathy is often correlated with elevated concentrations of hepatic toxins, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and bacterial toxins in the bloodstream. In vitro blood plasma studies have validated the ability of Sigyn Therapy to address hepatic toxins (ammonia, bile acid, and bilirubin), relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6), gram-negative bacterial toxin (endotoxin), and gram-positive bacterial toxins (peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid).
 
HE is often a common occurrence in cirrhosis patients awaiting a donor liver for transplant. As the reduced duration of an HE episode correlates with higher rates of survival to transplant, Sigyn Therapy may have potential utility as a bridge-to-liver transplant device.
 
Bridge-To-Liver Transplant 
 
There is an urgent need for a medical intervention that could reduce the circulating presence of hepatic toxins, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pathogenic factors as a means to assist in extending the lives to those awaiting a liver transplant. Based on these requirements, there may be an opportunity for Sigyn Therapy to stabilize or extend the life of a patient prior to the identification of a matched liver for transplantation - otherwise known as a bridge-to-liver transplant. In 2017, 8,082 U.S. patients received a liver transplant, and 13,885 patients were on the waiting list for a liver transplant. In that year, the average cost associated with a liver transplant was reported to be $577,100 USD.
 
Competitive Landscape
 
In the absence of a therapeutic drug to treat patients suffering from sepsis and other life-threatening disorders, extracorporeal blood purification devices are increasingly being deployed as front-line therapies.
 
Four industry pioneering technologies are of particular relevance; a cytokine adsorption technology (CytoSorb from Cytosorbents Corporation); a technology that removes circulating endotoxin (Toraymyxn from Toray Industries); and two devices that target the removal of pathogens from the bloodstream (the Hemopurifier from Aethlon Medical) and (the Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Filter from Exthera Medical).

-

 

CytoSorb is a clinical-stage therapeutic candidate in the United States and market cleared in more than 40 countries outside the U.S. CytoSorb was recently cleared to treat severe COVID-19 infections under FDA Emergency-Use Authorization (EUA) based on its ability to adsorb inflammatory cytokines from the bloodstream.
 
Toraymyxn is a clinical-stage therapeutic candidate in the United States and broadly market cleared outside the U.S. Toraymyxn houses an immobilized antibiotic agent with a high specificity to bind circulating endotoxin, a potent activator of sepsis resulting from gram-negative bacterial infections.
 
The Aethlon Hemopurifier is a clinical-stage therapeutic candidate in the United States. The Hemopurifier has been cleared to treat severe COVID-19 infections through an FDA IDE supplement and was previously cleared under FDA Emergency-Use Authorization (EUA) to treat Ebola virus. Immobilized within the Hemopurifier is an affinity lectin (Galanthus Nivalis Agglutinin) that has a high specificity to bind a broad-spectrum of viral pathogens from the bloodstream.
 
The Exthera Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Filter is a clinical-stage therapeutic candidate in the United States and market cleared outside the U.S. for the removal of bloodstream pathogens. The Seraph-100 was recently cleared and broadly deployed to treat severe COVID-19 infections under FDA Emergency-Use Authorization (EUA). The Seraph-100 incorporates heparin-coated polyethylene beads that bind both viral and bacterial pathogens in the bloodstream. 
 
We believe Sigyn Therapy’s expansive ability to address inflammatory cytokines, bacterial toxins (including endotoxin), hepatic toxins, and infectious viruses provides for an advantageous strategy to treat patients suffering from sepsis and other life-threatening disorders. However, there is no assurance that controlled human studies will demonstrate Sigyn Therapy to be a safe and effective treatment for any candidate indication.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
At present, our sole focus is the clinical and regulatory advancement of Sigyn Therapy. As such, we do not market or sell any therapeutic products at this time. However, we plan to forge relationships with organizations that have established distribution channels into markets that may have a demand for Sigyn Therapy should it receive market clearance from FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies.

Government Regulation
 
In the United States, Sigyn Therapy is subject to regulation by the FDA. Should we seek to commercialize Sigyn Therapy outside the United States, we expect to face comparable international regulatory oversight. Based on published guidance by FDA, Sigyn Therapy is a Class III medical device whose regulatory jurisdiction is the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), the FDA branch that oversees the market approval of medical devices. As a Class III device, we are subject to a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) submission pathway with CDRH. The approval of a PMA application to support market clearance of Sigyn Therapy will require extensive data, which includes but is not limited to technical documents, preclinical studies, animal studies, human clinical trials, the establishment of Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) standards and labeling that fulfills FDA’s requirement to demonstrate reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of a medical device product. In this regard, there is no assurance that Sigyn Therapy will be demonstrated to be a safe and effective product for any therapeutic indication that we pursue.
 
Should Sigyn Therapy receive market clearance, we will need to comply with applicable laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting for medical devices. Failure to comply with these applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Manufacturing and Procurement
 
We are advancing a manufacturing relationship with an FDA registered Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) to establish GMP compliant manufacturing to support human clinical studies and potential commercialization should we receive clearance to market Sigyn Therapy. We plan to establish manufacturing procedure specifications that define each stage of our manufacturing, inspection and testing processes and the control parameters or acceptance criteria that apply to each activity that result in the production of our technology.
 
We have also established relationships with industry vendors that provide components necessary to manufacture our device. Should the relationship with an industry vendor be interrupted or discontinued, we believe that alternate component suppliers can be identified to support the continued manufacturing of our product. However, delays related to interrupted or discontinued vendor relationships could adversely impact our business.
 
Research and Product Development 
 
To date, we have outsourced our research and product development activities, which include the performance of in vitro blood plasma validation studies, animal studies, pre-GMP product assembly and manufacturing through third party organizations with extensive experience in advancing extracorporeal blood purification technologies. At present, we do not have plans to build and staff our own research and product development facility.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
At present, our operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.
