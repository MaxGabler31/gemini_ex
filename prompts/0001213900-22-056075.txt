Our History and Corporate Structure



China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. (“China Health US”) was incorporated in the State of Arizona on July 11, 1996 and was the successor of the business known as Arizona Mist, Inc. which began in 1989. On May 9, 2005, it entered into a stock purchase agreement and share exchange (effecting a reverse merger) with Edmonds 6, Inc. (“Edmonds 6”), a Delaware corporation, and changed its name to Universal Fog, Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, Universal Fog, Inc. (which has been in continuous operation since 1996) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edmonds 6.



China Health Industries Holdings Limited (“China Health HK”) was incorporated on July 20, 2007 in Hong Kong under the Companies Ordinance as a limited liability company. China Health HK was formed for the purpose of seeking and consummating a merger or acquisition with a business entity organized as a private corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship as defined by FASB ACS Topic 915 (“Development Stage Entities”).



Harbin Humankind Biology Technology Co., Limited (“Humankind”) was incorporated in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) on December 14, 2003, as a limited liability company under the Company Law of the PRC. Humankind is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of health products.



On August 20, 2007, the sole shareholder of China Health HK entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with the owners of Humankind. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, China Health HK purchased 100% of the ownership in Humankind for a cash consideration of $60,408 (the “Share Purchase”). Subsequent to the completion of the Share Purchase, Humankind became a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Health HK. The Share Purchase was accounted for as a “reverse merger” since the owner of Humankind owned a majority of the outstanding shares of China Health HK’s common stock immediately following the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, it was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that have been reflected in the financial statements for periods prior to the Share Purchase are those of Humankind and have been recorded at the historical cost basis. After completion of the Share Purchase, China Health HK’s consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of both China Health HK and Humankind, the historical operations of Humankind, and the operations of China Health HK and its subsidiaries from the closing date of the Share Purchase onward.



On October 14, 2008, Humankind set up a 99% owned subsidiary, Harbin Huimeijia Medicine Company (“Huimeijia”), with its primary business being manufacturing and distributing medicine. Mr. Xin Sun, the Company’s majority owner, owns 1% of Huimeijia. Huimeijia is consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of China Health HK.



On December 31, 2008, China Health HK entered into a reverse merger with Universal Fog, Inc., a U.S. publicly traded shell company (the “Transaction”). China Health HK is the acquirer in the Transaction, and the Transaction was treated as a recapitalization of China Health US. After the Transaction and a 20:1 reverse stock split, Mr. Xin Sun owned 61,203,088 shares of common stock, representing 98.3% of the 62,234,737 total outstanding shares of common stock of China Health US. On April 7, 2009, Mr. Sun transferred 28,200,000 shares of common stock to 296 individuals, leaving him with 33,003,088 shares of common stock of China Health US, or approximately 53.03% of the total outstanding shares of common stock. Universal Fog, Inc. changed its name to China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. on February 19, 2009.



On November 22, 2013, Humankind completed the acquisition of Heilongjiang Huimeijia Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“HLJ Huimeijia”) for a total purchase price of $16,339,869 (RMB100,000,000). HLJ Huimeijia was founded on October 30, 2003, and is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of tincture, ointments, rubber paste (including hormones), topical solution, suppositories, liniment (including traditional Chinese medicine extractions), enemas and oral liquids. HLJ Huimeijia’s predecessor is Heilongjiang Xue Du Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which has established its brand name in the market through its supply of high-quality medical products. HLJ Huimeijia is categorized as a “high and new technology” enterprise by the Science Technology Department in Heilongjiang Province. HLJ Huimeijia has 21 products which have been approved by, and have received approval numbers issued by, the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”). In addition, HLJ Huimeijia is the holder of one patent for utility models, five patents for external design and three trademarks in China, including the Chinese brand name of “Xue Du” which has an established reputation among customers in northeastern China.

On December 24, 2014, Humankind entered into a stock transfer agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with (i) Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. a company incorporated under the laws of the PRC and located in Jilin province (“Xiuzheng Pharmacy” or the “Buyer”), (ii) Mr. Xin Sun, the CEO of the Company, and (iii) Huimeijia, a subsidiary of Humankind that is 99% owned by Humankind and 1% owned by Mr. Xin Sun. Pursuant to the Original Agreement, Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun (collectively, the “Equity Holders”), would sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy.



On February 9, 2015, the four parties entered into a supplementary agreement (the “Supplementary Agreement”) to modify the terms of the Original Agreement, pursuant to which the Equity Holders and Huimeijia (collectively, the “Asset Transferors”) would only sell 19 drug approval numbers (the “Assets”) to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The Equity Holders would have retained their equity interests in Huimeijia, but would have pledged such equity interests to Xiuzheng Pharmacy until the Assets were transferred.



On October 12, 2016, the four parties agreed to rescind the Supplementary Agreement and entered into a new supplementary agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to execute the transfer of the equity interests based on the Original Agreement, and the Equity Holders sold their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy for total cash consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately $1,306,186 USD, the “Purchase Price”) to the Equity Holders. As of October 12, 2016, Huimeijia had completed changes in its business registration, and Xiuzheng Pharmacy had obtained a new business license issued by the local State Administration of Industry and Commerce in Harbin (“Harbin SAIC”) for Huimeijia, in which Huimeijia’s ownership was recorded as held by Xiuzheng Pharmacy, and the legal representative (a person that is authorized to take most corporate actions on behalf of a company under PRC corporate laws) of Huimeijia had been appointed by the Buyer.



China Health US, China Health HK, Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia are collectively referred herein to as the “Company.”



As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s corporate structure was as follows:

Business Overview



Our principal business operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia.



The Company owns a GMP-certified plant and production facilities and has the capacity to produce 21 different NMPA-approved medicines, 14 NMPA-approved health supplement products and 8 hemp derivative products in soft capsule, hard capsule, tablet, granule, oral liquid forms. These products address the needs of some key sectors in China, including the feminine, geriatric, and children’s markets.



HLJ Huimeijia was founded on October 30, 2003 and its latest GMP certificate is effective until April 24, 2023. HLJ Huimeijia engages in the manufacture and distribution of tincture, ointments, rubber paste, including hormones, topical solution, suppositories, enemas, oral liquids, and liniment, including traditional Chinese medicine extractions. HLJ Huimeijia’s predecessor was Heilongjiang Xue Du Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which established brand recognition in the market through its supply of high-quality drug products. HLJ Huimeijia is a “high and new technology” enterprise that provides the most comprehensive types of topical medical products in Heilongjiang Province, a northeastern province of China.



We sell our products directly to end customers through our own sales personnel as well as our sales agents, operating primarily in Anhui, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Beijing and Gansu, where most of our revenues are generated. However, there is no such sales for the fiscal year 2022,which was primarily due to Humankind’s enterprise transformation, and the lock down of factory due to COVID-19. Humankind is using existing materials to research and develop new products. Humankind decided to transform the primary business to CBD extractive project, because the government intended to support the company research in CBD aspect. However, by the end of fiscal year 2022, the support guidelines had not been published. Although the research process is slow and unpredictable due to the zero-case policy and periodic quarantines caused by COVID-19 resurgence, we expect the CBD extractive project to be completed by the end of calendar year of 2022 (“Transformation”). We do not currently sell our products online, but we expect to do so in the future.



There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as such, the extent of the business disruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Manufacture



We manufacture our health food products on a plot of land located in Jin Xing Industrial Park, Songbei District, Harbin. On June 7, 2004, the Company entered into a Land Use Purchase Contract with the local government, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase the right to use a piece of land, approximately 8 acres (32,000 square meters), located in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province for commercial purposes for a fifty-year period from June 7, 2004 through June 6, 2054, for $637,261 (RMB5,248,000). The Company fully paid to the government the consideration for the land use right on June 13, 2004. The Department of Housing and Urban Development of Harbin City approved this transaction. The Company is in the process of applying for the title certificate from the local government. The manufacturing facility on the land is 4,000 square meters and there are five production lines which are sufficient for our purposes. We package our products in bottles, plastic containers and aluminum foil bags there.

Since we acquired HLJ Huimeijia on November 22, 2013, we also manufacture our medicines and drugs using HLJ Huimeijia’s land, approximately 43,350 square meters, located in Hai-lin Economic Development Zone, Mudanjiang City. The manufacturing facilities occupy approximately 5,710 square meters. We plan to build new manufacturing facilities on the land. The expected construction cost is approximately $7,520,000 (RMB 50,000,000).



Our Development Strategy



We will continue to focus on combining our products with traditional Chinese medicine, creating new products such as our hemp-based products, and developing our B2C e-business and chain-stores. We plan to implement health management projects in our future chain-stores throughout China and establish a database of our clients’ health data obtained from our B2C e-business and call center.



We plan to establish a one-stop shop for our customer’s health needs. From conducting a genetic profile of our customer to determine his/her susceptibility to certain types of diseases and then customizing health supplements and organic/green food to meet his/her needs, we plan to cater to our customer’s needs at all levels. With the distribution network we hope to establish through our chain stores and B2C e-businesses, we plan to eventually branch out into the sale and distribution of beauty products and medical appliances.



We plan to open chain stores of up to 100 stores within the next 24 months; establish our oversea sales to North America, South Asia and European Union; acquire pharmaceuticals to enhance marketing network and production capacity and increase investment in research and development of CBD drugs and hemp-based products.



The Future



Within the next ten years, our goals are to:



1. Increase product coverage in target markets to achieve 20%-30% coverage



Our target market is the health industry market. Presently, we believe that our product coverage is approximately 0.2%. We plan to open distribution stores in different provinces of China to expand our coverage. We also plan to sell our products through B2C websites to our customers.



 2. Develop to be among top 500 companies in the medicine, health product, health industry in the PRC



Currently, we are not ranked in the top 500 medicine, health product and health industry companies in the PRC. We believe that if our projected increase in revenue is achieved, we will achieve our goal of becoming one of the top 500 medicine, health product, health industry companies in China.



 3. Form a diversified management group



Currently, our management group comprises graduates from the most prestigious universities in the PRC, such as Peking University and Renmin University of China. We plan to further diversify our management group by hiring talent both in the PRC and abroad.



 4. Enter into the international market and create an internationally famous brand



Currently, our products are sold under the brand names “Qunle”, “Kindlink”, “Huimeijia” and “Dr. Xiao” in the PRC. Our goal is eventually to establish stable sales abroad in countries such as the United States of America, Russia, and Eastern Europe and South-east Asian countries.

Our approach to manufacturing, marketing, cost control and products distribution, which is detailed above, is designed to minimize production costs and increase revenue at the same time. We feel that our procedures will enable us to reach our sales goals with an optimal manufacturing cost. The result should yield profits and a return to our investors.



Good Manufacturing Practice or “GMP” is a term that is recognized worldwide for the control and management of manufacturing and quality control testing of foods and pharmaceutical products. An important part of GMP is documentation of every aspect of the process, activities, and operations involved with drug and medical device manufacture. Additionally, GMP requires that all manufacturing and testing equipment has been qualified as suitable for use, and that all operational methodologies and procedures (such as manufacturing, cleaning, and analytical testing) utilized in the drug manufacturing process have been validated (according to predetermined specifications), to demonstrate that they can perform their purported function(s). On December 1, 2019 the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect. One of the major amendments is the cancellation of GMP certification. The New Law eliminated the requirement that drug administration authorities shall assess drug manufacture enterprises and drug trading enterprises, and issue assessment certificates. Instead, it requires that drug manufacturing enterprises and drug trading enterprises establish and improve the quality management systems of manufacture and trade of drugs, and ensure that the process of manufacturing and trading of drugs always meets all legal requirements. This means a stricter form of supervision is implemented comparing to the prior GMP certificates system and our production lines are subject pilot inspection under the New Law.



The Market for Healthcare and Beauty Products



The health product industry is one of the mainstream industries in the PRC, since it has a high level of recognition and importance. Recently there have been new policies for health products, which control quality, manufacturing, manufacturing environments and techniques.



The Healthcare Product Market in the PRC



With thousands of years of history in health culture and traditional Chinese medicine, the PRC currently utilizes advanced techniques and production capacity to initiate new health care trends, from drugs and medicines to traditional health food and nutritional supplements, and from medical devices to health management and advice. These trends demonstrate huge potential in the PRC’s health products market.



With the rise of the concept of “Great Health”, the per capita expenditure of health products and the consumer group have been significantly improved.



Driven by the change of consumer treatment to prevention, the promotion of health awareness, the refinement of health needs and the pursuit of high-quality health products, the market scale of health products in China broke through RMB100 billion (USD16.2 billion) in 2014 and nearly RMB150 billion (USD22.2 billion) in 2017. Qianzhan Industry Research Institute in China predicted that the market scale of health products in China will reach RMB 243.5 billion (USD37.7 billion) in 2025.



Comparing the consumption habits of Chinese and American health products, we can see that there is still much room for development in China’s market. The penetration rate of health products in the United States is 50%, while that in China is only 20%, and in terms of per capita consumption, China is only one-eighth of that in the United States.



Hemp and its Market and Industry in the PRC



Hemp was originated from the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River with over eight-thousand years’ planting history. The hemp textile technology in our country has matured as early as two thousand years in the Western Han Dynasty. “Plain Color Zen Clothing”, coming up from Han Tombs at Mawangdui and other hemp textile products have become the milestone in the developing history of hemp textile technology.



Hemp, also known as Huoma, Xianma, Kuima, Hanma, Dama. Species that containing less than 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is considered as Hemp, and more than 0.3% is considered as Marijuana and Hashish internationally. Hemp is a kind of economic plant with special effects and can be grown in large areas in all parts of China. It has low requirements for soil and climate and can grow on relatively barren land. Planting hemp has become a way to get rich and get out of poverty in some poor areas.

Hemp is full of treasures. The skin, stem, seed, root, leaf and flower of hemp have utility value which can be widely applied in the fields of textile, paper-making, food, medicine, construction, transportation, national defense and military industry and so on. As a kind of traditional economic plant, hemp fiber has the functions of moisture absorption and perspiration, natural antimicrobial health care, good quality of adsorption, excellent quality of anti-UV and unique wave adsorption and sound attenuation. The stem of hemp has high degree of lignification and can be used to produce high value biologic additives, viscose fibers, top grade cigarette paper and wooden ceramics and so on. The leaf and flower of hemp can be used to produce various kinds of health products and the seed of hemp can be used to manufacture top grade edible oil, essential oil and hemp protein.



A hemp plant contains over 400 kinds of chemical components and can be divided into cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid compounds. Cannabinol (CBN) in cannabinoid has the functions of anti-inflammatory, analgesia, anti-convulsion and suppressing female hormone secretion. Cannabidiol (CBD) has the functions of anti-inflammatory, sterilization, analgesia, antianxiety, antipsychotic, antioxidation, neural protection, reducing enterocinesia and improving learning and memory ability.



Hemp is the major high-yielding crop of making traditional fiber products in China. It is a kind of high value-added economic crop with a wide range of uses and multi-purpose crop with market prospects that provides fiber, hemp stem and seed. Hemp has many unique natural characteristics, especially its environmental benefits and its natural versatility, which is a valuable kind of crop for ecological economy.



Textiles, clothing, military industry, construction materials, food, medicines, health supplements, cosmetics and skin care products of the downstream of hemp industry in China are relatively well-developed. The bottleneck that restricts the development of downstream industries is that the cultivation of hemp in the upstream has long been the planting mode of scattered peasant households, and has not formed large-scale industrialized cultivation and local initial processing capacity.



After years of development, Chinese consumers have gradually rationalized their attitude and behavior in the consumption of health care products, paying more attention to the safety and efficacy of health care products. At the same time, the government has gradually improved the laws and regulations of the health care industry and tightened its supervision.



The rejuvenation of the modern industry of hemp resulted from the major breakthrough in research and mass production of hemp. Firstly, cultivate new varieties of hemp with low activity of anesthetic in agricultural scientific research. The main component of these varieties of anesthetics is THC and the content of THC is controlled at 0.3% which approximates to non-toxicity. This has led to a renewed understanding and affirmation of the industrial use of hemp, and made the cultivation of hemp mechanize, effectively contributing to the development of hemp industry.



In order to meet the needs of the development of domestic and foreign market, China has successively reactivated the hemp industry projects in Yunnan, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui and Hubei provinces to set up factories and scientific research institutes to carry out research and development of various products. The natural functional advantages of its related products are favored by consumers at home and abroad. The products are exported to countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Korea. Currently, related products of hemp have also become an export-oriented pillar industry in China.



At present, on the basis of solving scientific and technological problems of deep degumming of hemp, extraction of fine fiber, extraction of CBD, purification of hemp seed oil, extraction of essential oil of hemp, extraction of hemp protein, biocomposites, fiber reinforced composite materials, carry out pilot plant test and industrialized mass production of related products of hemp, and gradually develop the deep comprehensive utilization of hemp products, demonstrating the strength of deep processing in the hemp industry.

● | Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Amendment, enacted January 17, 2011

● | Hemp Legislation of Heilongjiang Province in May 2017. 




In the PRC, a Good Manufacturing Practice Certification (“GMP Certification”) is required for companies that produce medical drugs and health supplements. It is also required to market our medical drugs and health supplements. According to the Administrative Rules of Drug Manufacturing and Certification issued by the NMPA of the PRC on September 7, 2005, the NMPA is responsible for the review and issuance of GMP Certification. To obtain a GMP Certification, a company shall submit its application; the NMPA will then conduct a technical review of the application materials; if such company passes the technical review, the NMPA will inspect the manufacturing site. The NMPA also conducts follow-up inspections on the manufacturing site. After the issuance of the GMP Certification, the NMPA may inspect the manufacturing site from time to time. However, instead of issuing GMP, the NMPA now issues SC Permit to food manufacturers in China, allowing them to manufacture and sell health products. The GMP Certifications of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Humankind, HLJ Huimeijia, are valid through February 14, 2019 and December 31, 2015, respectively. For the GMP Certificate of HLJ Huimeijia, the Company applied for a new certificate, which was obtained on April 25, 2018. Since obtaining the GMP Certification, we have been able to manufacture and market our products without further governmental approval. As Humankind is in the business of manufacturing and selling health products, it is considered as a food manufacturer in China. Humankind received its SC Permit on July 26, 2018, which will expire on September 12, 2021.The Company has applied for extension which is expect to be approved at the end of October 2021. On December 1, 2019 the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect. One of the major amendments is the cancellation of GMP certification. The New Law eliminated the requirement that drug administration authorities shall assess drug manufacture enterprises and drug trading enterprises, and issue assessment certificates. Instead, it requires that drug manufacturing enterprises and drug trading enterprises establish and improve the quality management systems of manufacture and trade of drugs, and ensure that the process of manufacturing and trading of drugs always meets all legal requirements. This means a stricter form of supervision is implemented comparing to the prior GMP certificates system and our production lines are subject pilot inspection under the New Law.

Besides, we have 12 sales persons as part-time employees. We believe that we are in compliance with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing and insurance regulations, and have good relations with our employees.
