ITEM 1.        BUSINESSHistory and Organization
     Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August 24, 1998. We are a producer of metal concentrates that contain gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, and doré containing gold and silver from the Aguila and Alta Gracia Projects in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico (“Oaxaca Mining Unit”). The Aguila Project includes the Arista underground mine and processing facility, which are currently in operation. The Alta Gracia Project includes the Mirador underground mine which began operations in 2017.  We also perform exploration and evaluation work on our portfolio of precious and base metal exploration properties in Nevada, United States of America (“Nevada Mining Unit”) and continue to evaluate other properties for possible acquisition.
     In this report, “Company,” “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with our subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.  See glossary on page 30 for additional definitions.
     The majority of our assets are located at our Oaxaca Mining Unit, including our Aguila processing facility, and Arista and Mirador underground mines. The Aguila processing facility produces metal concentrates and doré from ore mined from both the Arista and Mirador Mines. All of our production and revenue currently comes from our Oaxaca Mining Unit. 
     The Aguila and Alta Gracia Projects, which comprise our only operating properties, include a total of approximately 35,390 hectares of mining concessions, access roads from a major highway, haul roads, a processing facility, and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, an open pit and underground mines, tailings facilities and other infrastructure. Please see Item 2. Properties for maps and additional information.
     We commenced mining and milling operations from the Aguila Project in July 2010, initially from the Aguila open pit mine, followed by development and mining the Arista underground mine. The Arista Mine was expanded in 2016 with the development of the Switchback vein system. The Arista underground mine is located approximately two kilometers from the processing facility.  Most of the production from our Oaxaca Mining Unit from 2011 to present has been from the Arista Mine.
     We first reported Proven and Probable (“P&P”) reserves for our Arista Mine in 2014.  In 2016, we expanded Arista Mine’s P&P reserves with the addition of the Switchback vein system.  In February 2017, we announced our first proven and probable reserves for our Mirador Mine. In 2017, development of the Mirador Mine advanced to a point which allowed for consistent ore feed to the Aguila processing facility. Please see Item 2. Properties, Proven and Probable Reserves for more information. 
     Our operations in Oaxaca are conducted through our Mexican subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“DDGM”). Our Nevada exploration and evaluation work is performed through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, GRC Nevada Inc. and Walker Lane Minerals Corp. (“Walker Lane”).
     Our principal executive offices are located at 2886 Carriage Manor Point, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80906, and our telephone number is (303) 320-7708. We maintain a website at www.goldresourcecorp.com and through a link on our website you can view the periodic filings that we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as certain of our corporate governance documents such as our code of ethics. 

    Segment Information
     Our segments are broken into two geographic regions. The geographic regions include Oaxaca, Mexico (“Mexico”) and Nevada, U.S.A. (“Nevada”) and represent the Company’s operating segments.

 Developments in 2017
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported revenue of $110.2 million, mine gross profit of $42.1 million and net income of $4.2 million. Substantially all of our 2017 revenue was from the Arista Mine in Mexico. Our annual 2017 mill production totaled 28,117 gold ounces, 1,773,263 silver ounces, 1,141 copper tonnes, 5,365 lead tonnes and 16,301 zinc tonnes. In 2017, dividends distributed to shareholders totaled $0.02 per share or $1.1 million.
     Oaxaca Mining Unit 
     During 2017, we continued to develop the Arista underground mine, including the Switchback vein system.  Development of the Switchback vein system in 2017 reached the point that allows for bulk tonnage mining techniques planned in 2018.  
     In addition to the Arista underground mine, we advanced development of the Mirador Mine in 2017 and began delivering a limited amount of development ore to the Aguila processing facility in the second quarter.  
     Nevada Mining Unit
     During 2017, we acquired the highly prospective East Camp Douglas exploration property, and added a significant number of additional claims to the Isabella Pearl Project.  In addition, we continued to advance the permitting process for our Isabella Pearl Project.  Dividends 
     Since July 2010, we have paid a monthly dividend. During 2017, we paid one-sixth cent per share per month, which totaled $0.02 per share per year. Please see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information.     Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance
     Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below for additional information.Environmental Matters 
     We conduct our operations so as to protect the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our operating mines have reclamation plans in place that we believe meet all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2017, $2.9 million was accrued on our consolidated balance sheet for reclamation costs relating to operating properties.

Competitive Business Conditions
     The exploration for, and the acquisition of, gold and silver properties are subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Due to our limited capital and personnel, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, advancement of mining properties. Our present limited capital means that our ability to compete for properties to be explored and developed is limited. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future.Government Regulations and Permits 
     In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to United States and Mexican federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”), which is similar to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. SEMARNAT has broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with its environmental regulations or standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, including ours, include but are not limited to, acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust and noise. The agencies responsible for environmental protections and permitting in our Nevada Mining Unit include the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”).
     For operations at our Oaxaca Mining Unit, we have secured and continue to secure various regulatory permits from federal, state and local agencies. These governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate, the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues, and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations. We have received the required local community support for the Aguila and Alta Gracia Projects in the area where we are currently producing. 
     We are actively seeking the permits necessary to place our Nevada Mining Unit’s Isabella Pearl Project into production.  Please see Item 2. Properties – Nevada Mining Unit, for more information on the status of our permitting efforts.  In connection with these permits and exploration activities in Nevada, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment, including, but not limited to, the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
    
Customers
     During the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for 95% of our revenue in our Oaxaca Mining Unit. In the event that our relationship with the customer is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our products. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.Employees and Contractors
     We currently have sixteen full-time employees, six of which serve as our executive officers. These individuals devote all of their business time to our affairs. 
     We contract for the services of approximately 490 individuals employed by a third party and also use various independent contractors for underground mining, surface exploration drilling and trucking.
