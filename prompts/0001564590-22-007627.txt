Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company
 SP Plus Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which operates through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “SP+”, "we", "us", "our") facilitates the efficient movement of people, vehicles and personal belongings with the goal of enhancing the consumer experience while improving bottom line results for our clients. We provide technology-driven mobility solutions, professional parking management, ground transportation, remote baggage check-in and handling, facility maintenance, security and event logistics to aviation, commercial, hospitality, healthcare and government clients across North America.
Our Operations
 Our experience in the industries we serve has allowed us to develop and standardize a rigorous system of processes and controls that enable us to deliver consistent, transparent, value-added and high-quality services that, primarily through our technology-driven mobility solutions, facilitate the movement of people, vehicles and personal belongings. We serve a variety of industries and have industry vertical specific specialization. Our Commercial segment serves clients in commercial real estate, residential communities, hotels and resorts, healthcare facilities, municipalities and government facilities, retail operations, large event venues, colleges and universities. Our Aviation segment primarily serves clients in the aviation industry (i.e. airports, airlines, cruise lines and certain hospitality clients with baggage and parking services).
 We typically enter into contractual relationships with property owners or managers as opposed to owning facilities. We primarily operate under two types of arrangements: management type contracts and lease type contracts. See Part I. Industry Operating Arrangements for further discussion.
 Our revenue is derived from a broad and diverse group of clients, industry vertical markets and geographies. Our clients include some of North America's largest private and public owners, municipalities and governments, managers and developers of major office buildings, residential properties, commercial properties, shopping centers and other retail properties, healthcare facilities and medical centers, sports and special event complexes, hotels and resorts, airlines and cruise lines. No single client accounted for more than 5% of our revenue, net of reimbursed management type contract revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, we have built a diverse geographic footprint that spans operations in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and 4 Canadian provinces. Our strategy is focused on building scale and leadership positions in large, strategic markets in order to leverage the advantages of scale across a larger number of clients in a single market.
 Services
 As a professional service provider, we provide comprehensive, turn-key service offering packages to our clients. Under a typical management type contract structure, we are responsible for providing and supervising all personnel necessary to facilitate daily operations, which may include porters, baggage handlers, valet attendants, managers, bookkeepers, cashiers and a variety of ground transportation services, maintenance, marketing, customer service, and accounting and revenue control functions.
 In addition to the conventional management services described above, we also offer an expanded range of ground transportation services, baggage delivery and handling services and other ancillary services as described below for each of our Segment:

Industry Overview
 Overview
 The parking management, ground transportation services and baggage service providers, as well as technology solution providers that serve those industries, are large and fragmented. A substantial number of companies in these industries offer parking management services, ground transportation services, technology services and baggage services as non-core operations, and companies in these industries are large national competitors or small and private companies that operate in limited markets and geographies. Additionally, technological advancements are having an impact on both consumer behavior and information technology in these industries. From time to time, smaller operators find they lack the financial resources, economies of scale and/or management techniques required to compete for the business of increasingly sophisticated clients and the increasing demands of clients. We expect this trend to continue and will provide larger professional service and/or technology companies with greater opportunities to expand their businesses and potentially acquire smaller operators and/or technology companies. We also expect that new small operators and technology companies will continue to enter the market as they have in the past.
 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”)
 COVID-19 has impacted, and may continue to impact, our operations and results. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on future operations is hard to predict, as new guidance is continually being communicated by the U.S. Department of State, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and local governments. New guidance has and may include heightened government regulations, including vaccine mandates and travel advisories, which could impact our clients’ operations. In addition, certain industries have been impacted by workforce disruptions as a result of COVID-19. Currently, our operations have not experienced material disruptions as a result of employees who are unable or unwilling to work because of illness or fear of contracting COVID-19, or for other reasons. However, we have recently seen an increase in wages, as well as higher than normal open positions at our company. If this continues, our ability to grow and expand our business could be negatively impacted. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for risks related to COVID-19, as well as other risks related to our business and the industry.   
 Industry Operating Arrangements
 Professional service businesses, including our Company, operate primarily under two general types of arrangements, which include:
 Management Type Contracts
 Under management type contracts, the professional services operator typically receives a fixed and/or variable monthly fee for providing services and may receive an incentive fee based on the achievement of certain performance objectives. Professional services operators also generally charge fees for various ancillary services such as accounting support services, equipment leasing and consulting. Primary responsibilities under a management type contract include hiring, training and staffing personnel, and providing revenue collection, accounting, record-keeping, insurance and marketing services. The client is usually responsible for operating expenses associated with the client's operations, such as taxes, license and permit fees, insurance costs, payroll and accounts receivable processing and wages of personnel assigned to the operation, although some management type contracts, typically referred to as "reverse" management type contracts, require the professional service operator to pay certain of these cost categories but provide for payment to the operator of a larger management fee. Under a management type contract, the client usually is responsible for non-routine maintenance and repairs and capital improvements of the operation facility or location, such as structural and significant mechanical repairs. Management type contracts are typically for a term of one to three years (although the contracts may be terminated early and may contain renewal clauses).
Lease Type Contracts
 Under lease type contracts, the professional services operator generally pays to the client or property owner a fixed base rent or fee, percentage rent that is tied to the financial performance of the operation, or a combination of both. The professional services operator collects all revenue and is responsible for most operating expenses, but typically is not responsible for major maintenance, capital expenditures or real estate taxes. In contrast to management type contracts, lease type contracts typically have longer terms of three to ten years, and often contain a renewal term and provide for a fixed payment to the client regardless of the facility's operating earnings. In addition, many of these lease type contracts may be canceled by the client for various reasons, including development of the real estate for other uses, and may be canceled by the client on as little as 30 days' notice without cause. Lease type contracts generally require larger capital investment by the professional services operator than do management type contracts and therefore tend to have longer contract periods.
General Business Trends
 We believe that sophisticated clients recognize the potential for technology-driven mobility solutions, parking services, parking management, ground transportation services, baggage handling services and other ancillary services to be a profit generator and/or a service differentiator to their customers. By outsourcing these services, our clients are able to capture additional profit and improve customer experiences by leveraging unique technology, operational skills and controls that an experienced services and technology company can offer. Our ability to consistently deliver a uniformly high level of services to our clients, including the use of various technological solutions and enhancements, allows us to maximize the profit and/or customer experience for our clients and improves our ability to win contracts and retain existing clients.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe we have the following key competitive strengths:
  
• | A Leading Market Position with a Unique Value Proposition. We are one of the industry leading providers of technology-driven mobility solutions, parking management, ground transportation services, baggage services, and other ancillary services to commercial, hospitality, institutional, municipal and government, airports, airlines and cruise line clients across North America. One of our competitive advantages is our Sphere technology, which is a suite of industry-leading technology solutions that drives end-to-end mobility and delivers a frictionless consumer experience across all markets we serve.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These services include on-site parking management, valet parking, ground transportation services, facility maintenance, event logistics, baggage related services, remote airline check-in services, security services, municipal meter revenue collection and enforcement services, and consulting services. We market and offer many of our services under our SP+, Sphere and Bags brands, which reflect our ability to provide customized solutions and meet the varied demands of our diverse client base. We can augment our parking services by providing our clients with related services through our SP+ Parking, SP+ Facility Maintenance, SP+ GAMEDAY, SP+ Transportation, SP+ Event Logistics, Sphere, Bags and, in certain sections of the United States and Canada, SP+ Security service lines, thus enabling our clients to efficiently address various needs through a single vendor relationship. We believe our ability to offer a comprehensive range of services and leverage our Sphere platform on a national basis is a significant competitive advantage and allows our clients to attract, service and retain customers, gain access to the breadth and depth of our service and process expertise, leverage our significant technology capabilities and enhance their financial operations and customer experience.

• | Our Scale and Diversification. Expanding our client base, industry vertical markets and geographic locations has enabled us to significantly enhance our operating efficiency over the past several years by standardizing processes and managing overhead. The ability to use our scale and purchasing power with vendors drives cost savings and benefits for our client base.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Client Base. Our clients include some of North America's largest private and public owners, municipalities, managers and developers of major office buildings, residential properties, commercial properties, shopping centers and other retail properties, sports and special event complexes, hotels and resorts, healthcare facilities and medical centers, airports, airlines and cruise lines.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Industry Vertical Markets. We believe that our industry vertical market diversification, such as commercial real estate, residential communities, hotels and resorts, airports, airlines, cruise lines, healthcare facilities and medical centers, seaports, municipalities and government facilities, commercial real estate, residential communities, retail operations, large event venues, and colleges and universities, allows us to minimize our exposure to industry-specific seasonality and volatility. We believe that the breadth of end-markets we serve and the depths and diversity of services we offer to those end-markets provide us with a broader base of clients that we can target.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Geographic Locations. We have a diverse geographic footprint that includes operations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 4 Canadian provinces as of December 31, 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable Client Relationships. We have a track record of providing our clients with consistent, value-added and high quality services, which can enhance their customer’s experience. We continue to see a trend in outsourcing to professional service providers; we believe this trend has meaningful benefits to companies like ours, which has a national footprint and scale, extensive industry experience, broad process capabilities and a demonstrated ability to create value for our clients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established Platform for Future Growth. We have invested resources and developed a national infrastructure utilizing our Sphere technology solutions and platforms that are complemented by significant management expertise, which enable us to scale our business for future growth effectively and efficiently. We have the ability to transition into local service operations very quickly, from the simplest to the most complex operation, and have experience working with incumbent professional service operators to implement smooth and efficient takeovers and integrate new local professional service operations seamlessly into our existing operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Predictable Business Model. We believe that our business model provides us with a measure of insulation from broader economic cycles, because a significant portion of our locations operate on management type contracts that, for the most part, are not dependent upon the financial performance of the client's operation. In order to mitigate some of the effects from COVID-19, we converted many of our lease locations to management locations during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we were able to exit or renegotiate many less profitable contracts, which were for both lease-type and management-type contracts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly Capital Efficient Business with Attractive Cash Flow Characteristics. Our business generates attractive operating cash flow due to negative working capital dynamics. In addition, we generally have low capital expenditure requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Operational Excellence and Human Capital Management. Our culture and training programs place a continuing focus on excellence in the execution of all aspects of day-to-day operations. This focus is reflected in our ability to deliver to our clients professional, high-quality services through well-trained, service-oriented personnel, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors. To support our focus on operational excellence, we manage our human capital through a comprehensive, structured program that evaluates the competencies and performance of all of our key operations and administrative support personnel on an annual basis. We have also dedicated significant resources to human capital management, providing comprehensive training for our employees, delivered through the use of our web-based SP+ University learning management system, in addition to facilitated classes. This investment in our people promotes customer service and client retention in addition to providing our employees with continued training and career development opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Operational Compliance and Safety Initiatives. Our culture and training programs continue to focus on various compliance and safety initiatives and disciplines throughout the organization, as we implement an integrated approach for continuous improvement in our risk and safety programs. We have also dedicated significant resources to our risk and safety programs by providing comprehensive training for our employees, delivered primarily through the use of our web-based SP+ University learning management system, on-site training and our SP+irit in Safety newsletters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 Building on these competitive strengths, we believe we are well positioned to execute on the following growth strategies:
  
• | Grow our Business through Technology investments. We believe a significant opportunity exists to expand our business through the use of technology driven mobility solutions. We provide a suite of industry-leading technology solutions through Sphere and will continue to invest further in these products and offerings, as we believe Sphere is a key differentiator for us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow Our Business in Existing Geographic Markets. A component of our strategy is to capitalize on economies of scale and operating efficiencies by expanding our business in our existing geographic markets, especially in our core markets. As a given geographic market achieves a certain operational size, we will typically establish a local office in order to promote increased operating efficiency by enabling local managers to use a common staff for recruiting, training and human resources support. The concentration of our operating locations allows for increased operating efficiency and superior levels of customer service and retention through the accessibility of local managers and support resources.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Penetration in Our Current Industry Vertical Markets. We believe that a significant opportunity exists for us to further expand our presence into certain industry vertical markets, such as airports and aviation, colleges and universities, healthcare, municipalities, hospitality and event services. In order to effectively target these markets, we have implemented a go-to-market strategy of aligning our business by operating segment, industry vertical markets and branding our domain expertise through our SP+, Sphere and Bags designations to highlight the specialized expertise, competencies,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

services and technology offerings that we provide to meet the needs of each particular industry and customer. Our recognized SP+ brand, which emphasizes our specialized market expertise and distinguishes our ancillary service lines from traditional parking, includes a broad array of our operating divisions such as, SP+ Commercial Services, SP+ Airport Services, SP+ GAMEDAY, SP+ Healthcare Services, SP+ Hospitality Services, SP+ Municipal Services, SP+ Office Services, SP+ Residential Services, SP+ Retail Services, and SP+ University Services, that further highlight the market-specific subject matter expertise that enables our professionals to meet the varied demands of our clients.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand and Cross-Sell Additional Services to Drive Incremental Revenue. We believe we have significant opportunities to further strengthen our relationships with existing clients, and to attract new clients, by continuing to cross-sell value-added services that complement our core service operations. Bags is a leading provider of baggage services, remote airline check-in services, and other related services, primarily to airline, airport, sea ports, cruise lines and hotels and resorts. Bags combines exceptional customer service with innovative technologies to provide these value-add client and customer services. We believe there are opportunities to further cross-sell the aforementioned services that Bags provides to our existing clients within the aviation, hospitality and commercial markets and to cross-sell parking services and ground transportation services and other ancillary services to our existing Bags clients. Our emphasis on these innovative services will continue to drive value with our clients and allow us to expand our footprint into multiple markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our Geographic Platform. We believe that opportunities exist to further develop new geographic markets through new contracts, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures or partnerships. Clients that outsource the management of their operations and professional services often have a presence in a variety of urban markets and seek to outsource the management of their operations to a national provider. We continue to focus on leveraging relationships with existing clients that have locations in multiple markets as one potential entry point into developing new core markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on Operational Efficiencies to Further Improve Profitability. We have invested substantial resources in information technology and regularly seek to consolidate various corporate functions where possible in order to improve our processes and service offerings. In addition, we will continue to evaluate and improve our human capital management to ensure a consistent and high-level of service for our clients. The initiatives undertaken to date in these areas have improved our cost structure and enhanced our financial strength, which we believe will continue to yield future benefits. Sphere, Remote™ allows us to provide remote management services, whereby personnel are able to monitor revenue and other aspects of an operation and provide 24-hour-a-day customer assistance (including remedying equipment malfunctions at a facility) by using off-site personnel and equipment. We have begun expanding the facilities where our remote management technology is installed. Additionally, Sphere iQ™ reduces the dependency on local resources by providing remote support for daily revenue reporting and monthly billing maintenance, reducing the cost of local bookkeeping and allowing for increased focus on maximizing revenue. We expect these businesses to grow as clients focus on improving the profitability of their operations by decreasing labor costs at their locations through remote services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue Opportunistic, Strategic Acquisitions. The outsourced professional services industry and technology companies serving the industry remain fragmented and presents a significant opportunity for us. Given the scale in our existing operating platform, we have a demonstrated ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions. We will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and joint venture investment opportunities that we believe will help us acquire scale or further enhance our service capabilities and technology offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow and Expand the Hospitality and Healthcare Businesses. SP+ Hospitality and SP+ Healthcare Services is a leader in the hospitality and healthcare parking and valet industries, and management continues to believe there is significant opportunity to use SP+'s capabilities to further develop a national business in hospitality and healthcare. Our objective is to focus on the most important aspects of the business promptly upon obtaining a new location, from the first contact with a potential customer to the execution of our services. Given the importance of neat, clean and polite service, the success of our parking and valet business is dependent upon ensuring that its associates deliver excellent service every day. To accomplish this objective, our SP+ University Services™ provides training to our parking and valet associates. SP+ University Services™ continuously provides training to our parking and valet professionals to become an integrated extension of our clients' staff and blend seamlessly into the overall hospitality and healthcare experience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Development
 We place a specific focus on marketing and relationship efforts that pertain to those clients or prospective clients having a large regional or national presence. Accordingly, we assign dedicated executives to these existing or prospective clients to manage the overall relationship, as well as to reinforce existing account relationships and to develop new relationships, as well as to take any other action that may further our business development interests.
Competition
 We face competition from large national competitors and numerous smaller, locally owned independent professional service providers and operators, offering an array of services and professional service solutions, which may include developers, hotels and resorts, airports, airlines, cruise lines, national services companies and other institutions that may elect to internally manage their own professional service offerings. Additionally, technological factors that improve ride-sharing capabilities increase the use of parking aggregators and the use of third-party technology-driven mobility solutions can impact our parking and parking management business. Some of our present and potential competitors have or may be able to obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we have, which may negatively impact our ability to retain existing contracts and gain new contracts. We also face significant competition in our efforts to provide ancillary services such as shuttle bus services and on-street parking enforcement because of the number of large companies that specialize in these services.
 We compete for management contract type clients based on a variety of factors, including fees charged for services, providing a comprehensive suite of technology-driven mobility solutions, ability to generate revenues and control expenses for clients, accurate and timely reporting of operational results, providing high quality customer service and experience, and the ability to anticipate and respond to industry and technology related changes. Factors that affect our ability to compete for lease contract type locations include the ability to make financial commitments, long-term financial stability and the ability to generate revenues and control expenses. Factors affecting our ability to compete for employees include wages, benefits and working conditions.
 Support Operations
 We maintain regional and city offices throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. These offices serve as the centralized locations through which we provide the employees to staff our professional services as well as the on-site and support management staff to oversee those operations. Our administrative staff is primarily based in those same offices and facilitate the efficient, accurate and timely production and delivery of client deliverables, such as monthly reporting and invoicing. Having these all-inclusive operations and administrative teams located in regional and city offices throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico allows us to add new professional services for new and existing clients in a seamless and cost-efficient manner.
 Our overall basic corporate functions in the areas of finance, human resources, risk management, legal, purchasing and procurement, general administration, strategy, and product and technology development are primarily based in our Chicago corporate office, as well as the Nashville support office.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 16,600 individuals, including 10,800 full-time and 5,800 part-time employees. Approximately 28% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and represented by labor unions, which include various local operational employees. Various union locals represent local operational employees in the following cities: Akron (OH), Arlington, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Buffalo, Burbank, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Manchester (NH), Meadowlands, Miami, New York City, Newark, Oakland, Ontario (Canada), Orlando, Oxon Hill, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, Richmond, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Santa Monica, Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Windsor Locks.
 We are frequently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with various union locals. No single collective bargaining agreement covers a material number of our employees. We believe that our employee relations are generally healthy, as evidenced by higher than average rate of tenure and rate of internal promotions.
 Central to our ability to execute on our business strategy is the commitment of our employees to delivering excellence in execution of all aspects of our day-to-day operations. We strive to create an inclusive environment which promotes diversity across our organization and a safe and engaging work environment where our employees have the opportunity to succeed and grow. Through our comprehensive development programs and talent management systems, our employees refine their skills and are able to access continued training and career development opportunities. In addition to base salary, our compensation and benefits programs are structured to retain and motivate our employees.
 The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance. Because the safety is the responsibility of everyone, each employee is expected to take all safety and health polices seriously and help enforce these policies within the workplace. In 2020 and continuing through 2021, we quickly activated comprehensive health and safety protocols to ensure appropriate safety precautions to address COVID-19.  
 Insurance
 We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur in the operations that we lease or manage including coverage for general/garage liability, garage keepers legal liability, and auto liability. In addition, we purchase workers' compensation insurance for all eligible employees and umbrella/excess liability coverage. Under our various liability and workers' compensation insurance policies, we are obligated to pay directly or reimburse the insurance carrier for the deductible / retention amount for each loss covered by our general/garage liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation, and garage keepers legal liability policy. As a result, we are effectively self-insured for all claims up to the deductible / retention amount for each loss. We also purchase property insurance that provides coverage for loss or damage to our property and in some cases our clients' property, as well as business interruption coverage for lost operating income and certain associated expenses. Because of the size of the operations covered and our claims experience, we purchase insurance policies at prices that we believe represent a discount to the prices that would typically be charged to our clients on a stand-alone basis. The clients for whom we provide professional services pursuant to management type contracts have the option of purchasing their own liability insurance policies (provided that we are named as an additional insured party), but historically most of our clients have chosen to obtain insurance coverage by being named as additional insureds under our master liability insurance policies. Pursuant to our management type contracts, we charge those clients insurance-related costs.
 We provide group health insurance with respect to eligible full-time employees (whether they work at leased facilities, managed facilities or in our support offices). We self-insure the cost of the medical claims for these participants up to a stop-loss limit. Pursuant to our management type contracts, we charge those clients insurance-related costs.
 Regulation
 Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in some cases, municipal and state authorities directly regulate or impose extensive governmental restrictions concerning automobile capacity, pricing, structural integrity and certain prohibited practices. Additionally, many cities impose a tax or surcharge on parking services, which generally range from 10% to 50% of revenues collected. We collect and remit sales/parking taxes and file tax returns for ourselves and on behalf of our clients. We are affected by laws and regulations that may impose a direct assessment on us for failure to remit sales/parking taxes or to file tax returns for ourselves and on behalf of our clients.
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In connection with the operation of parking facilities, we may be potentially liable for any such costs.
 Several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car-pooling and the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage. These types of laws have adversely affected our revenues and could continue to do so in the future. For example, New York City and Boston imposed restrictions in the wake of terrorist attacks, which included street closures, traffic flow restrictions and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour. It is possible that cities could enact new or additional measures such as higher tolls, increased taxes and vehicle occupancy requirements in certain circumstances, which could adversely impact us. We are also affected by zoning and use restrictions and other laws and regulations that are common to any business that deals with real estate.
 In addition, we are subject to laws generally applicable to businesses, including, but not limited to federal, state and local regulations relating to wage and hour matters, including minimum wage per hour laws and regulations imposed, employee classification, mandatory healthcare benefits, unlawful workplace discrimination, human rights laws and whistle blowing. Several cities in which we have operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so-called "living wage" ordinances, which could adversely impact our profitability by requiring companies that contract with local governmental authorities and other employers to increase wages to levels substantially above the federal minimum wage. In addition, we are subject to provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended ("OSHA"), and related regulations. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with any regulation applicable to our business or any whistle-blowing claim, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation, regulatory action or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In connection with ground transportation services and certain airline and cruise line transportation, baggage services and remote airline check-in services provided to our clients, the U.S. Department of Transportation, including the Transportation Security Administration (the "TSA"), the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") and Department of Homeland Security, and various federal and state agencies, exercise broad powers over these certain transportation services, including shuttle bus operations, baggage delivery services, remote airline check-in, licensing and authorizations, safety, training and insurance requirements. Our employees must also comply with the various safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other federal agencies, including those related to minimum training hours and requirements, drug and alcohol testing and service hours. We may become subject to new and more restrictive federal and state regulations. Compliance with such regulations may increase our operating costs.
 Regulations by the FAA may affect our business. The FAA generally prohibits parking within 300 feet of airport terminals during times of heightened alert. The 300 feet rule and new regulations may prevent us from using a number of existing spaces during heightened security alerts at airports. Reductions in the number of parking spaces may reduce our operating income and cash flow.

Various other governmental regulations affect our operation of property or facilities, both directly and indirectly, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"). Under the ADA, all public accommodations, including parking facilities, are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. For example, the ADA requires parking facilities to include handicapped spaces, headroom for wheelchair vans, attendants' booths that accommodate wheelchairs and elevators that are operable by disabled persons. When negotiating contracts with clients, we generally require that the property owner contractually assume responsibility for any ADA liability in connection with the property or facility. There can be no assurance, however, that the property owner has assumed such liability for any given property or that we would not be held liable despite assumption of responsibility for such liability by the property owner. We believe that the parking facilities we operate are in substantial compliance with ADA requirements.
 We are also subject to consumer credit laws and credit card industry rules and regulations relating to the processing of credit card transactions, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Payment Card Data Security Standard. These laws and industry standards impose substantial financial penalties for non-compliance.
