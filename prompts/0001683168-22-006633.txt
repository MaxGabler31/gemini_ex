ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We have been a developer and manufacturer of advanced optical instruments since 1982. Our medical instrumentation line includes traditional endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom imaging and illumination products for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Our core efforts are targeted at the development of next generation endoscopes. Through internal research and development and working in partnership with our customers, we continuously develop next generation capabilities for designing and manufacturing 3D endoscopes and very small Microprecision™ lenses, anticipating future requirements as the surgical community continues to demand smaller and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery.
 
The COVID-19 world-wide pandemic and the domestic and international impact of policy decisions being made in major countries around the world has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on various aspects of our business. While we and many of our medical device and defense contracting customers continue to operate as essential businesses, we have taken various actions to augment our operating and human resource policies and procedures to guard against the potential health hazards of COVID-19. These augmented procedures can have a negative impact on our operational efficiencies. Given the uncertainty surrounding the continuation of economic slow-downs domestically and abroad, we cannot predict with certainty at this time what the future impact of COVID-19 and resulting business and economic policies in the US and abroad will be on our up-coming financial operating results.
 
As Ross Optical Industries of El Paso, Texas we also operate as a supplier of custom optical components and assemblies for military and defense, medical and various other industrial applications. All products sold by us under the Ross Optical name include a custom or catalog optic, which is sourced through our extensive domestic and worldwide network of optical fabrication companies. Most systems make use of optical lenses, prisms, mirrors and windows and range from individual optical components to complex mechano-optical assemblies. Products often include thin film optical coatings that are applied using our in-house coating department. Over 70% of the Ross Optical division sales are in the United States, with the majority being specialized optical components for industrial applications and the remainder being assemblies. The balance of sales is split between military and medical device products.
 
On October 4, 2021, we closed on an asset purchase agreement with an effective date of October 1, 2021 with Lighthouse Imaging, LLC and Anania & Associates Investment Company, LLC for substantially all of the assets of Lighthouse Imaging, LLC, a Maine limited liability company operating a medical optics and digital imaging business.

Approximately 34% our business during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 is from engineering services primarily relating to the design of medical device optical assemblies, 41% from the sale of both internally manufactured and purchased optical components, and 25% from the manufacture of optical assemblies and sub-assemblies primarily for medical device instrument applications. Our proprietary medical instrumentation line, unique custom design and manufacturing capabilities, and expert electrical engineering and development has generated traditional proprietary endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom imaging and illumination products for our customers’ use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. We design and manufacture 3D endoscopes and very small Microprecision lenses, assemblies and complete medical devices to meet the surgical community’s continuing demand for smaller, disposable, and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery.
 
We are registered to the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485:2016 Quality Standards and comply with the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices and the European Union Medical Device Directive for CE marking of our medical products.
 
History
 
We incorporated in Massachusetts in December 1982 and have been publicly-owned since November 1990. References to our Company contained herein include our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Precise Medical, Inc. and Wood’s Precision Optics Corporation, Limited, except where the context otherwise requires.
 
Our websites are www.poci.com, www.rossoptical.com, and www.lighthouseoptics.com. Information contained on our websites does not constitute part of this report.
 
Principal Products and Services
 
Our Current Core Business: Since 1982, we have manufactured medical products such as endoscopes and endocouplers. We have developed and sold endoscopes incorporating various optical technologies including our proprietary Lenslock™ technology, for use in a variety of minimally invasive surgical and diagnostic procedures. Today, we produce endoscopes for various applications, which are CE marked and therefore certified for sale throughout the European Economic Area. Since 1985, we have developed, manufactured and sold a proprietary product line of endocouplers. We also design and manufacture custom optical medical devices to satisfy our customers’ specific requirements. In addition to medical devices, we also manufacture and sell components and assemblies specially designed for industrial and military use.
 
The acquisition of the assets of Ross Optical Industries effective June 1, 2019 expanded our optics components and assemblies business. All products supplied by Ross Optical include a custom or catalog optic, which is sourced through Ross Optical’s extensive domestic and worldwide network of optical fabrication companies. Most systems make use of optical lenses, prisms, mirrors and windows and range from individual optical components to complex mechano-optical assemblies. Products often include thin film optical coatings that are applied by the Ross Optical division in-house coating department.
 
The acquisition of the assets of Lighthouse Imaging LLC effective October 1, 2021 expanded our electrical engineering and development of end-to-end medical visualization devices. Product development competencies at Lighthouse Imaging include systems, optical, mechanical, electrical and process development engineering. The Lighthouse product development team has extensive experience developing visualization systems that are used in a variety of clinical applications representing a vertical integration of our established product development capabilities we believe will provide our customers with value-added product development service and product offerings.
 
Microprecision™ Lenses and Micro Medical Cameras: While the size of endoscopes has gradually decreased over time, the widespread use of very small endoscopes, with diameters of one millimeter or smaller, has been limited, in part, we believe, by the inability of traditional lens fabrication methods to support these smaller sizes with good image quality and acceptable manufacturing costs. We believe our Microprecision™ optics technology provides a solution to this problem. Combined with recent advances by other companies in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, or CMOS, image sensor fabrication techniques, our Microprecision™ lenses and proprietary manufacturing techniques enable the manufacture of micro medical cameras at low prices and with sizes on the order of one millimeter or less, characteristics that make them well suited to medical applications.

We are currently engaged in development projects with numerous customers to design and produce even smaller CMOS based camera modules together with customized illumination using various technologies to match the needs of the medical device endoscopes. We are also currently designing disposable versions of our camera modules and assemblies designed for single-use and reduced risk of contamination from repeated use. We believe these on-going improvements are significant to the continued evolution and acceptance of our Microprecision™ technology platform. 
 
We have been engaged by various customers for an increasing amount of development work relating to the design of endoscopes and camera assemblies that utilize our Microprecision™ technology. We previously received production orders each exceeding $1M and follow-on orders from multiple customers for their custom designed products fulfillment of which is ongoing. We believe we will receive additional production orders from other customers currently in our engineering and design pipeline.
 
3D Endoscopes: Our 3D endoscopes provide next generation optical imaging for minimally invasive surgical procedures that utilize hand-held rigid endoscopes by using the brain’s natural ability to perceive depth, which is the third dimension, by viewing one’s environment through two eyes. Utilizing our proprietary technology to provide independent images to right and left eyes, surgeons can view the operative field with 3D perception.
Competition and Markets
 
We sell our products in highly competitive markets and we compete for business with both foreign and domestic manufacturers. Many of our current competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, there is an ongoing risk that other domestic or foreign companies who do not currently service or manufacture products for our target markets, some with greater experience in the optics industry and greater financial resources than we have, may seek to produce products or services that compete directly with ours.
 
While our resources are substantially more limited than those of some of our competitors, we believe that we can compete successfully in this market on the basis of product quality, price, delivery and innovation tailored to our customers’ specifications. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain a technological advantage over our competitors and to effectively incorporate that technology into our custom designs. To this end, we intend to continue to aggressively support and augment our internal engineering, research and development resources and to aggressively pursue patent protection for existing and new technology. We believe that our unique technical capabilities in the areas of Microprecision™ optics, micro medical cameras and illumination, as well as 3D endoscopes, currently represent competitive advantages for us in the minimally invasive surgical device market. We recently augmented and extended these capabilities with the acquisition of Lighthouse Imaging which brings to the Company extensive experience with design and manufacture of minimally invasive optical imaging surgical devices, particularly those utilizing CMOS sensor and associated electronics technologies.
 
The competitive advantage of our Ross Optical division is its ability to provide difficult-to-find optics, and, increasingly, to provide a broader range of services based on its ability to source optics worldwide and augmented by its ability to provide thin-film coatings and assembly.
 
Market Opportunities
 
Microprecision™ Lenses and Micro Medical Cameras: While other approaches exist for the manufacture of camera lenses, we design custom camera module assemblies with the combined objectives of low cost, small size, range of optical specifications and high image quality required by our customer’s precise medical device specifications. By enabling the production of millimeter sized and smaller cameras with low manufacturing costs, we believe our Microprecision™ technology opens the possibility to replace existing re-sterilizable endoscopes with a single-use alternative. Also, the small size of our Microprecision™ lenses and micro medical cameras combined with our proprietary illumination techniques can provide visualization for existing procedures that are currently performed blind or with sub-optimal imaging, and we believe can facilitate the development of new surgical procedures that are currently impractical without sub-millimeter visualization instrumentation. 
3D Endoscopes and Robotic Surgery Systems: 3D endoscopes have been used for many years as part of robotic surgery systems partly because the market price of robotic surgery systems is high enough to support the cost of a high-quality custom 3D display. Competition amongst medical device companies, many of which are our customers for other products, in the area of 3D robotic surgery systems is increasing, and various companies are now pursuing less expensive, procedure specific robotic systems. We believe our experience and expertise in 3D endoscopes for medical applications could be a benefit to various companies in this area that could provide us with new product development and manufacturing opportunities.

Sales and Marketing
 
Current sales and marketing activities are intended to broaden awareness of the benefits of our new technology platforms and our successful application of these new technologies to medical device projects requiring surgery-grade visualization, as well as defense and other industrial applications, from sub-millimeter sized devices and 3D endoscopy, including single-use products and assemblies. We market directly to established medical device companies primarily in the United States that we believe could benefit from our advanced endoscopy visualization systems. Through this direct marketing, referrals, attendance at trade shows and a presence in online professional association websites, we have expanded our on-going pipeline of projects to significant medical device companies and to well-funded emerging technology companies. We expect our customer pipeline to continue to expand as development projects transition to production orders and new customer projects enter the development phase. Our Ross Optical and Lighthouse divisions market through existing customers and trade shows, in addition to proactive online marketing strategies executed primarily through their websites. Through the gradual integration of the sales, marketing and operating resources of the three operations we have expect to realize both expanded sales opportunities from the coupling of Ross’ worldwide vendor relationships for optical components with our micro optics engineering services now expanded and strengthened by the addition of the Lighthouse electrical engineering expertise.
International Business
 
Other than the Ross Optical division international sales described below, we have had negligible direct export sales to date. However, our medical products have received the CE mark certification, which permits sales into the European Economic Area and which benefits our customers as they market their products manufactured by us or containing our sub-assemblies into markets outside the United States. In the future, we may establish or use additional production facilities overseas to produce key components for our business, such as lenses. From the 1990s through approximately 2014, we maintained a physical presence in Asia to support business and quality control activities throughout the region as needed. We continue to acquire various optical components from overseas to meet the needs of custom device designs. We believe that the availability of specialized components and cost savings from various overseas production resources is essential to our ability to deliver complex and unique device designs and to compete on a price basis in the medical products area particularly and to our profitability generally.
 
Ross Optical has an expanded network of overseas suppliers of various types and sizes of optical components and assemblies that enhance our ability to meet the material demands of our customers’ unique optical and medical device designs. During fiscal year 2022, 23% of the Ross Optical division sales were to customers outside of the United States and Canada, with the balance of sales primarily split between Western Europe and Singapore.
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success depends, to a large degree, on our ability to continue to conceive and develop new optical products and technologies to enhance the performance characteristics and methods of manufacture of existing and new products. Although development work on behalf of customers is almost entirely performed under revenue generating contracts and customer purchase orders, research and development expenses are incurred on our own proprietary products and technology, such as Microprecision™ optics, micro medical cameras and 3D endoscopes. Accordingly, we treat engineering expenses not consumed in customer contracted development and our investment of funds and resources in internal product and intellectual property development as research and development expense in the accompanying statement of operations. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, research and development expenses were $666,479 and $624,253, respectively.
Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
A key raw material component for our products is precision grade optical glass, which we obtain from a few suppliers, principally SCHOTT North America, Inc. and Ohara Corporation. 
 
We obtain CMOS sensors used in our development of endoscope products for our customers from various suppliers such as OmniVision Technologies, Inc. We believe that while the number of sources of supply is limited for the CMOS sensors with the specifications used in medical device endoscopes we develop; the manufacturing capacities of those suppliers is adequate to meet our demand in the next twelve months.

We have experienced supply disruptions and customer delays from certain vendors and customers that we believe were the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slow-down. Although we are not currently experiencing vendor supply issues as a result of COVID-19, we cannot predict with certainty at this time what the future impact of COVID-19 and resulting business and economic policies in the US and abroad will be on our vendors and principal suppliers.
 
Patents and Trademarks 
 
We rely, in part, upon patents, trade secrets and proprietary knowledge as well as personnel policies and employee confidentiality agreements concerning inventions and other creative efforts to develop and maintain our competitive position. We plan to file for patents, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and in other appropriate countries to protect our intellectual property rights to the greatest extent practicable. We currently hold rights to various United States patents, and have patent applications pending, including applications for our new generation of micro medical cameras. Our current patent portfolio includes patents, rights to patents and patent applications that cover various aspects of our technology in the following areas:

— | Medical devices; 
--+--------------------------------------------------
— | 3-D endoscopes; 
— | Microprecision™ lenses and micro medical cameras;
— | Defense products. 

 
The patents contained in our current patent portfolio have various expiration dates through May 2036. We are not aware of any infringements of these patents. While we believe that our pending applications relate to patentable devices or concepts, these patents may not ultimately be issued and we may not be able to successfully defend these patents or effectively limit the development of competitive products and services.
 
In July 2011, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc., in which we assigned to Intuitive Surgical all of the issued and non-expired patents and pending patent applications that we held at that time, and in return, Intuitive Surgical granted us a royalty-free, worldwide license to these patents in fields outside of medical robotics.
 
We intend to continue to innovate and extend our technological capabilities in the areas of 3-D endoscopy Microprecision™ optics, micro medical cameras, and related illumination techniques, and to aggressively pursue patent protection for such developments.

As of June 30, 2022, we had 77 employees, 76 of which were full-time employees. There were 36 employees in manufacturing, 21in engineering/research and development, 8 in sales, and 12 in finance and administration. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are very good.
Customers
 
During fiscal year 2022 we sold product and services to over 377 customers and no customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021.
 
Our largest customer account receivable balance at June 30, 2022, was 8% of total accounts receivable. At June 30, 2021, our largest customer account receivable balance was 16% of total accounts receivable. No other accounts accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at June 30, 2022, or 2021.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relative to the protection of the environment. From time to time, we use a small amount of hazardous materials in our operations. We believe that we currently comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and intend to do our best efforts to remain in compliance. Such compliance does not entail significant expense to us.

Government Regulations
 
Domestic Regulation. We currently develop, manufacture and sell several medical products, the marketing of which is subject to governmental regulation in the United States. Medical devices are regulated in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and, in some cases, by certain state agencies. The FDA regulates the research, design, testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, promotion and distribution of medical devices in the United States. Generally, medical devices require clearance or approval prior to commercial distribution. Additionally, certain material changes to, and changes in, intended uses of, medical devices are also subject to FDA review and clearance or approval. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in failure of the FDA to grant pre-market clearance or approval, withdrawal or suspension of approval, suspension of production, or the imposition of various other penalties.
 
We previously notified the FDA of our intent to market our endoscopes, image couplers, beamsplitters, adapters and video ophthalmoscopes, and the FDA has determined that we may market such devices, subject to the general control provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. We obtained this FDA permission without the need to undergo a lengthy and expensive approval process due to the FDA’s determination that such devices met the regulatory standard of being substantially equivalent to existing FDA-approved devices.
 
In the future, we plan to market additional medical devices that may require the FDA’s permission to market such products. We may also develop additional products or seek to sell some of our current or future medical products in a manner that requires us to obtain the permission of the FDA to market such products, as well as the regulatory approval or license of other federal, state and local agencies or similar agencies in other countries. The FDA has authority to conduct detailed inspections of manufacturing plants in order to assure that “good manufacturing practices” are being followed in the manufacture of medical devices including medical devices or components of medical devices manufactured for other medical device companies, to require periodic reporting of product defects to the FDA, and to prohibit the sale of devices which do not comply with law.
 
We design and manufacture components for the defense industry, and our Ross Optical division imports, exports and manufactures optical products for the defense industry, some of which is controlled by U.S. regulations. Generally, these regulations require strict control over technical data in documented form and as embodied in products, both within our company and as part of exported shipments. In particular, we maintain a technology control plan, we are ISO certified and ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) registered with the U.S. State Department and we maintain a number of technology assistance agreements with overseas suppliers that have been approved by the U.S. State Department. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in U.S. actions that may result in withdrawal or suspension of approvals, suspension of company imports, exports or production, or the imposition of fines or various other penalties.
 
Foreign Requirements. Sales of medical device products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that may vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements would jeopardize our ability to market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in the European Union member countries of the European Economic Area for medical device products differs from that in the United States. Medical devices sold in the European Economic Area must bear the Conformité Européenne, or CE mark. Devices are classified by manufacturers according to the risks they represent, with a classification of Class III representing the highest risk devices and Class I representing the lowest risk devices. Once a device has been classified, the manufacturer can follow one of a series of conformity assessment routes, typically through a registered quality system, and demonstrate compliance to a “European Notified Body.” The CE mark may then be applied to the device. Maintenance of the system is ensured through annual on-site audits by the notified body and a post-market surveillance system requiring the manufacturer to submit serious complaints to the appropriate governmental authority. All of our medical products are manufactured in conformity with the CE mark requirements.
