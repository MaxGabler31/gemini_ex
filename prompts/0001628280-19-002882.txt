Item 1.    BUSINESS. 
GNC Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to as "Holdings", "GNC", "the Company", "we", "us" and "our" unless specified otherwise) connects customers to their best selves by offering a premium assortment of health, wellness and performance products, including protein, performance supplements, weight management supplements, vitamins, herbs and greens, wellness supplements, health and beauty, food and drink and other general merchandise, featuring both proprietary GNC and nationally recognized third-party brands. Our diversified, multi-channel business model generates revenue from product sales through company-owned retail stores, domestic and international franchise activities, third-party contract manufacturing, e-commerce and wholesale partnerships. We are headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "GNC." Our business was founded in 1935 by David Shakarian who opened our first health food store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Our principal executive office is located at 300 Sixth Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, and our telephone number is (412) 288-4600. We maintain and make available on GNC.com, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file or furnish them to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
Business Strategy
Key elements of our business strategy are detailed below: 
Leading brand of nutritional supplements. GNC has been in business for more than 80 years and the Company is built on a core foundation as a brand builder of high-quality nutritional supplements. Based on our worldwide network of approximately 8,400 locations and our online channels, we are a leading global brand of health, wellness and performance products. 
Our objective is to offer a broad and deep mix of products for consumers interested in living well, whether they are looking to treat a health-related issue, maintain their overall wellness, or improve their performance. Our premium, value-added offerings include both proprietary GNC-branded products and other nationally recognized third-party brands. 
We believe our depth of brands, exclusive products and range of merchandise, combined with the customer support and service we offer, differentiates us and allows us to effectively compete against food, drug and mass channel players, specialty stores, independent vitamin, supplement and natural food shops and online retailers.
Product development and innovation.  We develop high-quality, innovative nutritional supplement products that can be purchased only through our store locations, GNC.com, our Amazon.com marketplace and our select wholesale partners. Our high quality ingredients are rigorously tested before going into GNC products, undergoing multiple quality checks to ensure that they meet our high standards for identity, strength, purity, composition and limits in contaminants. 
We believe our sector-leading innovation capability is a significant competitive advantage. Our recently announced strategic partnership with International Vitamin Corporation ("IVC") will allow us to further focus on innovation while IVC drives increased efficiencies in manufacturing. GNC has demonstrated strength in developing unique, branded, and scientifically verified products and has a long history of delivering new ingredients and reformulations. We directly employ scientists, nutritionists, formulators, chemists, engineers and quality control experts and have access to a wide range of world-class medical research facilities and consultants. Refer to Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 20, “Subsequent Events” for more information.
A differentiated retail customer experience. Our retail strategy is to deliver a compelling experience at every customer touch point. We operate in a highly personalized, aspirational sector and believe that the nutritional supplement consumer often desires and seeks out product expertise and knowledgeable customer service. 
We further differentiate ourselves from competitors through development of our well-trained sales associates, who are aided in becoming trusted advisors with regular training that focuses on solution-based selling, and through in-store technology such as tablets, which allow associates to view customers’ purchase history and preferences. With that knowledge, and help from sales tools built into the tablet platform, associates can engage customers in conversation, share product information and testimonials before and after pictures, recommend solutions and help customers add complimentary products and build wellness regimens.
Our loyalty programs allow us to develop and maintain a large and loyal customer base, provide targeted offers and information, and connect with our customers on a regular basis. We harness data generated by these programs to better understand customers’ buying behaviors and needs, so we can deliver a stronger experience, bring like-minded consumers into the channel and make well-informed decisions about the business. 
4

Omni-channel development. We believe our diversified, omni-channel model, which includes company-owned stores, domestic and international franchise locations, wholesale locations and e-commerce, can differentiate us from online-only competitors. Our strategy is to give consumers a seamless, integrated experience across digital, mobile and store channels and in every interaction they have with GNC. 
Through GNC.com and our Amazon.com storefront, customers can research and purchase our products online. We believe our store base is a competitive advantage, allowing customers to experience our products and get expert advice from an associate.
Our omni-channel model can enhance the customer experience and increase the lifetime value of a GNC customer, and we are implementing strategies to blend our digital, online and in-store platforms. These initiatives include increased cross-channel marketing, online and in-store subscription services, giving customers the option of picking up online purchases in GNC stores, shipping products purchased via e-commerce directly from stores, and additional educational content, information and advice on GNC.com.
International growth. We see opportunity to expand internationally within the large global supplement market which is expected to continue to grow. In particular, our partnership with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd ("Harbin") allows us to further expand our business in China. Harbin’s expertise in distribution and regulation is the ideal match for our highly valued brand and assortment of products in the China market. Refer to Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 20, “Subsequent Events” for more information.
 Driving constructive industry dialogue.  We remain focused on continuously raising the bar on transparency and quality throughout the dietary supplement industry. We believe that over time the implementation of higher standards and more stringent industry self-regulation regarding manufacturing practices, ingredient traceability and product transparency will prove beneficial for the industry and lead to improved dialogue with regulators, stronger consumer trust and greater confidence in our industry.
Segments
We generate revenues from our three segments, which are U.S. and Canada, International and Manufacturing / Wholesale. The following table outlines our total revenue by segments. For a description of operating income (loss) by segment, our total assets by segment and our total revenues by geographic area, see Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 18, "Segments."

(1) Excludes intersegment sales.
(2) Relates to Lucky Vitamin which was sold in September 2017.
Although we believe that none of our segment operations experience significant seasonal fluctuations, historically we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, the lowest amount of revenue in our fourth quarter compared with the first three quarters of the year.
U.S. and Canada
Our U.S. and Canada segment generates revenues primarily from the sale of products to customers at our company-owned stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, through product sales to domestic franchisees, royalties on domestic franchise retail sales, franchise fees and through GNC.com and our market place on Amazon. 
Company-Owned Retail Stores in the U.S. and Canada
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 3,206 company-owned stores across all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the United States, in Canada and Puerto Rico. Most of our company-owned stores in the United States are between 1,000 and 2,000 square feet and are located primarily in strip shopping centers and shopping malls. 
5

Domestic Franchise Stores
As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,037 domestic franchise stores. Our franchise stores in the United States are typically between 1,000 and 2,000 square feet, and approximately 90% are located in strip shopping centers. We believe we have good relationships with our franchisees, as evidenced by our domestic franchisee renewal rate of approximately 90% between 2013 and 2018. Currently, we have 459 franchisees operating stores in the United States. We do not rely heavily on any single franchise operator in the United States, where our largest franchisee owns and/or operates 82 store locations.
All of our franchise stores in the United States offer both our proprietary products and third-party products, with a product selection similar to that of our company-owned stores. 
Revenues from our franchisees in the United States accounted for approximately 15% of our total U.S. and Canada segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. New franchisees in the United States are required to pay an initial fee of $40,000 for a franchise license and existing GNC franchise operators may purchase an additional franchise license for a $30,000 fee. Once a franchise store begins operations, franchisees are required to pay us a continuing royalty of 6% of sales and contribute 3% of sales to a national advertising fund. Our standard franchise agreements for the United States are effective for an initial ten-year period with unlimited five-year renewal options. At the end of the initial term and each of the renewal periods, the renewal fee is generally 33% of the franchise fee that is then in effect. The franchisee renewal option is generally at our election. Franchisees must meet certain conditions to exercise the franchisee renewal option. Our franchisees in the United States receive limited geographical exclusivity and are required to utilize the standard GNC store format.
Generally, we negotiate lease terms to secure locations at cost-effective rates, which we typically sublease to our franchisees at cost. Franchisees must meet certain minimum standards and duties prescribed by our franchise operations manual, and we conduct periodic field visit reports to ensure our minimum standards are maintained. If a franchisee does not meet specified performance and appearance criteria, we are permitted to terminate the franchise agreement. In these situations, we may take possession of the location, inventory and equipment, and operate the store as a company-owned store or refranchise the location.
Websites
GNC.com continues to represent a significant part of our business. The ability to purchase our products through the internet also offers a convenient method for repeat customers to evaluate and purchase new and existing products. This additional sales channel has enabled us to market and sell our products in regions where we have limited or no retail operations. We may offer products on our website that are not available at our retail locations, enabling us to broaden the assortment of products available to our customers. We also offer a product assortment on our market place on Amazon, the revenue of which is included in our GNC.com business unit. 
International
Our International segment generates revenue primarily from our international franchisees through product sales, royalties and franchise fees and also includes our China and Ireland operations. 
International Franchise Stores
As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,941 international franchise locations operating in approximately 50 international countries (including distribution centers where retail sales are made). The international franchise locations are typically smaller than our domestic locations and, depending upon the country and cultural preferences, are located in mall, strip shopping center, street or store-within-a-store locations. In addition, some international franchisees sell on the internet and distribute to other retail outlets in their respective countries. Typically, our international stores have a store format and signage similar to our United States franchise stores. We believe that our franchise program enhances our brand awareness and market presence and will enable us to continue to expand our store base internationally with limited capital expenditures. 
Our international franchise stores generally offer a more limited product selection than our franchise stores in the United States, primarily due to regulatory constraints.
Revenues from our international franchisees accounted for approximately 70% of our total international segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. New international franchisees were required to pay an initial fee of approximately $25,000 for a franchise license for each full size store, $12,500 for a franchise license for a store-within-a-store and continuing royalty fees. Our international franchise program has enabled us to expand into international markets with limited investment. 
We enter into development agreements with international franchisees which grants the right to develop a specific number of stores, for either full-size stores or store-within-a-store locations, in a territory, often the entire country. We enter into distribution agreements with international franchisees which grants the right to distribute product through the store locations, wholesale distribution centers and, in some cases, limited internet distribution. The franchisee then enters into a franchise agreement for each 
6

location. The full-size store franchise agreement has an initial ten-year term with two five-year renewal options. The franchisee typically has the option to renew the agreement at 33% of the current initial franchise fee that is then being charged to new franchisees. Franchise agreements for international store-within-a-store locations have an initial term of five years, with two five-year renewal options. At the end of the initial term and each of the renewal periods, the franchisee has the option to renew the store-within-a-store agreement for up to a maximum of 50% of the franchise fee that is then in effect. Our international franchisees often receive exclusive franchising rights to the entire country, generally excluding United States military bases. Our international franchisees must meet minimum standards and duties similar to our United States franchisees.
Manufacturing / Wholesale
Our Manufacturing / Wholesale segment is comprised of our manufacturing operations in South Carolina and our wholesale partner relationships. Our manufacturing facility supplies our U.S. and Canada and International segments with proprietary product and also manufactures products for other third parties. Our wholesale partner business includes the sale of products to wholesale customers, the largest of which include Rite Aid, Sam's Club and PetSmart. 
Our manufacturing operations are designed to ensure low-cost production of a variety of products of different quantities, sizes and packaging configurations while maintaining strict levels of quality control. Our manufacturing procedures are designed to promote consistency and quality in our finished goods. We conduct sample testing on raw materials and finished products, including weight, purity and micro bacterial testing. The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process are natural and synthetic vitamins, herbs, minerals and gelatin. We maintain multiple sources for the majority of our raw materials, although certain materials are single-sourced due to the unique nature of the material. In 2018, our largest vendor supplied approximately 8% of our raw materials. Refer to Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 20, “Subsequent Events” for more information on our recently announced strategic partnership with IVC.
To increase brand awareness and promote access to customers who may not frequent specialty nutrition stores, we entered into a strategic alliance with Rite Aid in December 1998 to open GNC franchise "store-within-a-store" locations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,183 Rite Aid store-within-a-store locations. Through this strategic alliance, we generate revenues from sales to Rite Aid of our products at wholesale prices, the manufacture of Rite Aid private label products, retail sales of certain consigned inventory and license fees. We are Rite Aid's sole supplier for a number of Rite Aid private label supplements, pursuant to a supply agreement with Rite Aid that extends through 2021. The operating license that comprises our store-within-a store alliance with Rite Aid was extended through 2021. We terminated the consignment agreement with Rite Aid in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Other
 Revenue prior to 2018 also included the results of an additional website, LuckyVitamin.com, beginning in August 2011 and through September 30, 2017. We sold substantially all of the assets of our Lucky Vitamin subsidiary effective September 30, 2017. 
Products
We are a global health and wellness brand with a diversified omni-channel business. Our product assortment includes health, wellness and performance products, including protein, performance supplements, weight management supplements, vitamins, herbs and greens, wellness supplements, health and beauty, food and drink and other general merchandise. Refer to Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 3, "Revenue" of this Annual Report for a breakdown of revenue by product category. Our domestic stores offer an extensive mix of brands across multiple categories and products. Through our GNC.com and our Amazon market place, we offer additional products to customers. This variety is designed to provide our customers with a wide selection of products to fit their specific needs and to generate a high number of transactions with purchases from multiple product categories.
We offer a wide range of high-quality nutritional supplements sold under our GNC proprietary brand names. Sales of our proprietary brands at our U.S. company-owned and franchise stores, GNC.com and wholesale partners including Rite Aid, PetSmart and Sam's Club represented 51% and 44% of total system-wide retail product sales in 2018 and 2017, or $1,072 million and $960 million, respectively. We also offer products through nationally recognized third-party brand names. Sales of our third-party products at our U.S. company-owned and franchise stores, GNC.com and wholesale partners represented approximately 49% and 56% of total system-wide retail product sales in 2018 and 2017, or $1,011 million and $1,204 million, respectively, and together with proprietary sales yielded total U.S. system-wide sales of $2,083 and $2,164 million. In 2018 and 2017, we did not have a material concentration of sales from any single product or product line. Our largest vendor supplied approximately 17% and 15% of our third-party products in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Effective with the launch of the "One New GNC" program on December 29, 2016, the Gold Card Member Pricing program was discontinued in all domestic company-owned and franchise stores and we introduced a free points-based loyalty program, 
7

which enables customers to earn points based on their purchases. Points earned by members are valid for one year and may be redeemed for cash discounts on any product we sell at both company-owned or franchise locations. In addition, we offer a paid membership program, "PRO Access," for $39.99 per year, which provides members with the delivery of sample boxes throughout the membership year, as well as the offering of certain other benefits including the opportunity to earn triple points on a periodic basis. The boxes include sample merchandise and other materials. 
Product Distribution
Products are delivered to retail stores, wholesale distributors, international franchisees and directly to customers who purchase through online, via a third party transportation network, primarily through our distribution centers located in: Leetsdale, Pennsylvania; Whitestown, Indiana; Anderson, South Carolina, and Phoenix, Arizona. Our distribution centers support our company-owned stores as well as franchise stores and Rite Aid locations. Each of our distribution centers has a quality control department that monitors products received from our vendors to ensure they meet our quality standards. Internet purchases are fulfilled and shipped directly from our distribution centers to our consumers using a third-party transportation service, or directly by Amazon for certain market place orders.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,500 employees, including approximately 5,900 full-time and 9,600 part-time employees. None of our employees belong to a union or are party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Competition
The United States nutritional supplements retail and packaged goods industry is a large, highly fragmented and growing industry, with no single industry participant accounting for a majority of total industry retail sales. Competition is based on multiple factors, including price, quality and assortment of products, customer service, convenience of store locations and online platform, marketing support and availability of new products. In addition, the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products.
We compete with both publicly and privately owned companies, which are highly fragmented in terms of geographical market coverage and product categories. We also compete with other specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi-level marketing organizations, mail-order companies, other internet sites and a variety of other smaller participants. In the United States, many of our competitors have national brands that are heavily advertised and are manufactured by large pharmaceutical and food companies and other retailers. Most supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchants have narrow product offerings limited primarily to simple vitamins, herbs and popular third-party sports and diet products. Our international competitors also include large international pharmacy chains and major international supermarket chains, as well as other large U.S.-based companies with international operations. Our wholesale and manufacturing operations compete with other wholesalers and manufacturers of third-party nutritional supplements.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe trademark protection is particularly important to the maintenance of the recognized brand names under which we market our products. We own or have rights to material trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our products, including the GNC brand name. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including trademark, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Protection of our intellectual property often affords us the opportunity to enhance our position in the marketplace by precluding our competitors from using or otherwise exploiting our technology and brands. We are also a party to several intellectual property license agreements relating to certain of our products. The duration of our trademark registrations is generally 10, 15 or 20 years, depending on the country in which the marks are registered, and we can renew the registrations. The scope and duration of our intellectual property protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product. Our global trademark portfolio, with the aforementioned registration durations, consists of our core marks for our business and our proprietary product brands which drive significant brand awareness for all of our reportable segments.  Our proprietary product formulas and recipes, maintained as trade secrets, are significant to our growth and success as they form the foundation for our production and sales of effective, high quality products.
8

Insurance and Risk Management
We are self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation and general liability insurance and maintain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit our liability exposure. We face an inherent risk of exposure to potential product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of products sold by us results in injury. We carry product liability insurance with a deductible/retention of $4.0 million per claim with an aggregate cap on retained losses of $10.0 million per policy year. For product liability claims stemming from third party products sold in our stores, we generally have the ability to refer such claims directly to our vendors and their insurers. In most cases, our insurance covers such claims that are not adequately covered by a vendor's insurance and provides for excess secondary coverage above the limits provided by our product vendors. We are fully insured for health insurance. 
We also purchase insurance to cover auto liability, network and cyber security, privacy liability, employment practice, and other casualty and property risks. We self-insure certain property and casualty risks such as property damage due to our analysis of the risk, the frequency and severity of a loss and the cost of insurance for the risk. 
Government Regulation
Product Regulation
Domestic
The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA") and the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold.
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA") amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDC Act") to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under the FDC Act, dietary ingredients (i.e., vitamins; minerals; herb or other botanical; amino acids; or dietary substances for use by humans to supplement diet by increasing total dietary intake; or any concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any of the above) that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. "New" dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were "not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994") must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been "present in the food supply as an article used for food" without being "chemically altered." A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a "history of use or other evidence of safety" establishing that use of the dietary ingredient "will reasonably be expected to be safe." A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient. In 2011 and 2016, the FDA issued draft guidances setting forth recommendations for complying with the new dietary ingredient notification requirement. Although FDA guidance is non-binding and does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities, and companies are free to use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, FDA guidance is a strong indication of the FDA's "current thinking" on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. At this time, it is difficult to determine whether the 2016 draft guidance (which replaced the 2011 draft guidance), if finalized, would have a material impact on our operations. However, if the FDA were to enforce the applicable statutes and regulations in accordance with the draft guidance as written, such enforcement could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, enjoining the manufacturing of our products until the FDA determines that we are in compliance and can resume manufacturing, increasing our liability and reducing our growth prospects.
The FDA or other agencies could take actions against products or product ingredients that, in their determination, present an unreasonable health risk to consumers that would make it illegal for us to sell such products. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer warnings with respect to the products or ingredients in such products that are sold in our stores. Such actions or warnings could be based on information received through FDC Act-mandated reporting of serious adverse events.
We take a number of actions to ensure the products we sell comply with the FDC Act.  Some of these actions include maintaining and continuously updating a list of restricted ingredients that will be prohibited from inclusion in any products that are sold in our stores or on our websites.  Vendors selling product to us for the sale of such products by us will be required to warrant to us that the products sold to us do not contain any of these restricted ingredients.  In addition, we have developed and maintain a list of ingredients that we believe comply with the applicable provisions of the FDC Act. As is common in our industry, we rely on our third-party vendors to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our vendors. 
9

However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from the market, which in certain cases could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A removal or recall could also result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. In the past, we have attempted to offset any losses related to recalls and removals with reformulated or alternative products; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to offset all or any portion of losses related to any future removal or recall.
The FDC Act permits structure/function claims to be included in labels and labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-market approval. However, companies must have substantiation that the claims are “truthful and not misleading”, and must submit a notification with the text of the claims to the FDA no later than 30 days after marketing the dietary supplement with the claims. Permissible structure/function claims may describe how a particular nutrient or dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function. The label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease (i.e. a disease claim). If the FDA determines that a particular structure/function claim is an unacceptable disease claim that causes the product to be regulated as a drug, a, conventional food claim or an unauthorized version of a "health claim," or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading in any particular, we would be prevented from using the claim and would have to update our product labels and labeling accordingly.
In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called "third-party literature," e.g., “a publication, including an article, a chapter in a book, or an official abstract of a peer-reviewed scientific publication that appears in an article and was prepared by the author or the editors of the publication” supplements, when reprinted in its entirety, may be used "in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers" without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature: (1) must not be false or misleading; (2) may not "promote" a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement; (3) must present a balanced view or is displayed or presented with other such items on the same subject matter so as to present a balanced view of the available scientific information; (4) if displayed in an establishment, must be physically separate from the dietary supplements; and (5) should not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products, and any continued dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug.
In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FDC Act as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all dietary supplement manufacturers, and the FDA conducts inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. There remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the FDA's interpretation of the regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities.
In addition, the FDA's interpretation of the regulations governing dietary supplements will likely change over time as the agency becomes more familiar with the industry and the regulations. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility "adulterated," and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which was enacted in January 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements, which will likely increase the costs of dietary ingredients and will subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA will also require importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements.
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, require the reporting of serious adverse events, require a recall of illegal or unsafe products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the United States courts.
The FSMA expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA's ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, and require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues. FMSA also gave FDA the authority to administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.
10

The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and requires that all advertising to consumers be truthful and non-misleading. The FTC actively monitors the dietary supplement space and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. As a result of these enforcement actions, we continue to be subject to a consent decree issued by the FTC in 1994 that limits our ability to make certain claims with respect to our hair care products.
The FTC continues to monitor our advertising and, from time to time, requests substantiation with respect to such advertising to assess compliance with the outstanding consent decree and with the Federal Trade Commission Act. Our policy is to use advertising that complies with the consent decree and applicable regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that inadvertent failures to comply with the consent decree and applicable regulations will not occur.
Some of the products sold by franchise stores are purchased by franchisees directly from other vendors and these products do not flow through our distribution centers. Although franchise contracts contain strict requirements for store operations, including compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot exercise the same degree of control over franchisees as we do over our company-owned stores. Failure by us or our franchisees to comply with the consent decree and applicable regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
As a result of our efforts to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of our products and revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
Foreign
Our products sold in foreign countries are also subject to regulation under various national, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs. Government regulations in foreign countries may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our products.
New Legislation or Regulation
Legislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements. We cannot determine what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
Franchise Regulation
We must comply with regulations adopted by the FTC and with the laws of several states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising and certain state laws require that we furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular containing information prescribed by the Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising and applicable state laws and regulations.
We also must comply with a number of state laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These laws may limit a franchisor's business practices in a number of ways, including limiting the ability to:
•terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause;
•interfere with the right of free association among franchisees;
•disapprove the transfer of a franchise;
•discriminate among franchisees with regard to franchise terms and charges, royalties and other fees; and
•place new stores near existing franchises.
To date, these laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. Bills concerning the regulation of certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into Congress on several occasions during the last decade, but none have been enacted. Revisions to the FTC rule have also been proposed by the FTC and currently are in the comment stage of the rulemaking process.

Our international franchise agreements and franchise operations are regulated by various foreign laws, rules and regulations. These laws may limit a franchisor's business practices in a number of ways. To date, these laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations.
Environmental Compliance
As part of soil and groundwater remediation conducted at the South Carolina manufacturing facility pursuant to an investigation conducted in partnership with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (the "DHEC"), we have completed additional investigations with the DHEC's approval, including the installation and operation of a pilot vapor extraction system under a portion of the facility in the second half of 2016, which was an immaterial cost to the Company. After an initial monitoring period, in October of 2017 the DHEC approved a work plan for extended monitoring of such system and the contamination into 2021. We will continue to consult with the DHEC on the next steps in the work after their review of the results of the extended monitoring is complete. At this stage of the investigation, however, it is not possible to estimate the timing and extent of any additional remedial action that may be required, the ultimate cost of remediation, or the amount of our potential liability. Therefore, no liability has been recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. As further described in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Date," Note 20, "Subsequent Events," the Company entered into a join venture arrangement regarding the Company's manufacturing business. The joint venture will continue to consult with the DHEC on the next steps in the work after their review of the results of the extended monitoring is complete. 
In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges from its operations into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water and groundwater. New laws, changes in existing laws or the interpretation thereof, or the development of new facts or changes in their processes could cause us to incur additional capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations and environmental permits. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment without regard to fault or knowledge about the condition or action causing the liability. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or for properties to which substances or wastes that were sent in connection with current or former operations at its facilities. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could also adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties, or to use them as collateral for financing. 
From time to time, we have incurred costs and obligations for correcting environmental and health and safety noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to certain of our properties or properties at which our waste has been disposed. However, compliance with the provisions of national, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, financial position, liquidity or competitive position. We believe we have complied with, and are currently complying with, our environmental obligations pursuant to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and that any liabilities for noncompliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance or cash flows. However, it is difficult to predict future liabilities and obligations, which could be material.
