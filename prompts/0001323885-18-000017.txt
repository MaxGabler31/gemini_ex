ITEM 1.  BUSINESS Overview 
 We are a leading innovator in treatments for atrial fibrillation (Afib) and left atrial appendage (LAA) management. We have several product lines for the ablation of cardiac tissue, including our Isolator® Synergy™ Ablation System, the first and only surgical device approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent and longstanding persistent forms of Afib in patients undergoing certain open heart procedures. We also offer a variety of minimally invasive ablation devices and access tools to facilitate the growing trend in less invasive cardiac and thoracic surgery. Our cryoICE® cryosurgery product line offers a variety of cryoablation devices for use in multiple types of cardiothoracic surgery. Our AtriClip® Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion System is specifically designed to occlude the heart’s left atrial appendage. 
 Physicians have adopted our radiofrequency (RF) ablation and cryoablation systems to treat Afib in over 250,000 patients since 2004, and we believe that we are currently the market leader in the surgical treatment of Afib. Our products are used by physicians during both open-heart and minimally invasive surgical procedures, either on a concomitant or standalone basis. During a concomitant procedure, the physician ablates cardiac tissue and/or occludes the LAA, secondary, or concomitant, to a primary structural heart procedure such as a valve repair or replacement or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Our Isolator Synergy System is approved by FDA for the treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent Afib concomitant to other open-heart surgical procedures. Our other ablation devices are all cleared for sale under FDA 510(k) clearances, including our other RF and cryoablation products, which are indicated for the ablation of cardiac tissue and/or the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, our cryoICE probe is cleared for managing pain by temporarily ablating peripheral nerves. Our AtriClip products are 510(k)-cleared with an indication for the occlusion of the heart’s LAA, in conjunction with other cardiac surgical procedures. We also have a line of reusable surgical instruments typically used in cardiac valve replacement or repair. We anticipate that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will relate to products we currently sell, or are in the process of developing, which are used to ablate cardiac tissue, to occlude the left atrial appendage, to support mitral and aortic valve replacement and repair and/or to ablate peripheral nerves during cardiothoracic surgery.
 Afib affects approximately 1% of the population in the United States. It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, encountered in clinical practice and accounts for more doctor visits and hospital days than any other cardiac arrhythmia. When a patient is in Afib, abnormal electrical impulses cause the atria, or upper chambers of the heart, to fibrillate, or beat rapidly, irregularly, and in an uncoordinated fashion. As a result, blood in the atria may become static, increasing the risk that a blood clot will form and cause a stroke or other serious complications. Symptoms of Afib may include heart palpitations, dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath, and these symptoms may be debilitating and life threatening in some cases. Patients often progress from being in Afib intermittently to being in Afib continuously. Afib often occurs in conjunction with other cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery disease and valvular disease. 
 In the United States, we sell our products to medical centers through our direct sales force. In certain international markets, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux region, sales are also made directly to medical centers, while other international sales are made to distributors who in turn sell our products to end users. Our business is primarily transacted in U.S. Dollars with the exception of transactions with our European subsidiaries, which are transacted in Euros or British Pounds.

Market Overview 
 Afib is the most commonly diagnosed sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and affects more than 30 million people worldwide, including more than five million in the United States. It is estimated that the incidence of Afib doubles with each decade of an adult’s life. At age 40, remaining lifetime risk for Afib is 26% for men and 23% for women. Afib is an under-diagnosed condition due in large part to the fact that patients with Afib often have mild or no symptoms and their Afib is only diagnosed when they seek treatment for an associated condition, such as a structural heart disease or stroke. We believe that increasing awareness of Afib and improved diagnostic screening will result in an increased number of patients diagnosed with Afib. Recently, there have been several new diagnostic technologies introduced in the United States that allow for less invasive screening options, which should assist patients with more compliant and proactive identification of Afib. Also, since the prevalence of Afib increases with age, there will likely be an increase in the number of diagnosed Afib patients in the United States as the population ages. We believe that the same trends in the United States apply globally, as in many geographies the incidence of Afib is increasing as the population ages.    Afib is a condition that doctors often find difficult to treat and, historically, there has been no widely accepted long-term cure for Afib. This difficulty is exacerbated with more serious forms of Afib, which are typically classified as “persistent” and “long-standing persistent” Afib. Doctors typically begin treating Afib with pharmaceuticals, which are often ineffective, not well-tolerated and may be associated with serious side effects, including the risk of bleeding. Patients who cannot effectively be treated with pharmaceuticals may be candidates to undergo catheter-based procedures to treat their Afib. To perform a catheter ablation, an electrophysiologist inserts a flexible catheter into the inside of the heart, typically through the femoral vein. Catheter-based procedures, especially for more serious forms of Afib, are generally not indicated for patients with persistent or long-standing persistent Afib. Implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, are sometimes used to reduce the frequency and symptoms of Afib although they are not designed to treat the underlying disease. In the past, an open-heart surgical procedure known as the “cut and sew Maze” was used to treat Afib. While the cut and sew Maze was highly effective, this procedure has not been widely adopted because it is technically challenging, highly invasive and involves long recovery times. Over the past two decades, technology advancements have made surgical ablation more effective, repeatable and available to cardiac surgeons around the world. Recent societal guideline changes from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) have increased the level of recommendation for concomitant surgical ablation to Class 1, meaning that it is a “recommended” treatment, no longer just “reasonable”, for patients who have structural heart disease and Afib. These societal guidelines are reflective of the scientific evidence suggesting that surgical ablation is safe and effective for all structural heart patients who also have Afib.    Of the patients undergoing open-heart surgery globally on an annual basis, we estimate that over 250,000 are potential candidates for surgical ablation using our products. Today, we estimate that approximately 25-30% of those candidates are being treated, but we believe many of these are not treated properly or fully. Of the population diagnosed with Afib, a large percentage of patients are symptomatic and do not respond to pharmacological therapy. Additionally, there is a large population of patients who have no other underlying cardiac disease but who suffer from serious forms of Afib. Many of these patients fail traditional therapies, and thus we believe could benefit from a minimally invasive or multi-disciplinary (“hybrid”) Afib treatment using our products.
 In addition, Afib is thought to be responsible for approximately 15% to 20% of the estimated 700,000 strokes that occur annually in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, the risk of stroke is five times higher in people with Afib. Studies have also suggested that 90% of clots that cause strokes in patients who have Afib originate from within the LAA. Afib accounts for billions of dollars in hospitalization-related and office visit costs in the United States each year. Indirect costs, such as the management of Afib-related strokes, are believed to be significant. Because of the risk of stroke, and the significant cost burden on the healthcare system, more and more surgeons are routinely addressing the LAA. We believe that our AtriClip system is safer, more effective and easier to use than other products and techniques for occluding the LAA, and, because of this, we believe that the market for the AtriClip system represents a significant growth opportunity.
 Cardiothoracic surgery involving an incision through the ribcage, typically referred to as thoracotomy access, can often times result in post-operative pain and longer hospital recovery times as patients refrain from mobilizing their chest near the incision site. Most cardiothoracic surgeons will employ a multi-modal pain management protocol that includes global and local pain management techniques. Global techniques include epidural delivery of medication directly around the spinal cord, intravenous, or oral delivery of opioid and non-opioid pain medications. Local, more focused, techniques include syringe injections between vertebrates and cryoanalgesia, the use of cryo-energy to temporarily ablate peripheral nerves. Cryoanalgesia can be delivered using the cryoICE CRYO2 probe, the same probe used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. Depending on the degree of invasiveness of the cardiothoracic surgery, physicians and their nursing staff will take advantage of multiple modes of pain management. It is estimated that each year roughly 150,000 cardiothoracic procedures are performed in the United States through thoracotomy access. Hospital recovery times can vary from two to eight days depending on the procedure, operative complications associated with the procedure, pain management protocol, and other factors. In recent years, opioids have come under heavy scrutiny due to their potential for long-term dependency, overdose and possible death. The Center for Disease Control has reported over 42,000 deaths involving opioids in the United States in a single year, and both federal and local governments have proposed and implemented new regulations to curb the opioid overdose epidemic.

 The AtriCure Solution and Products 
 We believe the competing surgical and catheter-based ablation devices currently available are not ideal for safely, rapidly and reliably creating lesions that completely and permanently block the abnormal electrical impulses that cause Afib, particularly for patients with more chronic forms of Afib or patients who have failed single or multiple catheter ablations. Our products, including our Isolator Synergy System, enable cardiothoracic surgeons to mimic the cut and sew Maze procedure but with a faster, less invasive and less technically challenging approach.    Clinical studies for the use of our ablation products to treat Afib are ongoing. Leading cardiothoracic surgeons and electrophysiologists, including those who serve or who have served as consultants to us, have published results of initial clinical studies utilizing our Isolator Synergy System. The results of these studies are to evaluate efficacy, ease of use and safety.
 We have two primary product lines for cardiac tissue ablation, a product line for left atrial appendage management and a product line for temporary pain management.    Product lines for cardiac tissue ablation:

1.) | Radio Frequency Ablation Devices. Our Isolator Synergy System and related RF devices, such as our multifunctional pens, represent our primary product line and currently generate the majority of our revenue. Physicians use the Isolator Synergy System and related RF devices in both open and minimally invasive procedures. These devices are powered by an Isolator Synergy Ablation and Sensing Unit (ASU), Electrosurgical Unit (ESU) or nContact RF Generator, which are compact power generators that we generally place with our direct customers and sell to our distributors. Our RF devices primarily consist of the following products:
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Isolator Synergy and Isolator Synergy Access® Clamps. We sell multiple configurations of our Isolator Synergy clamps. All of our clamps are single-use disposables and have jaws that close in a parallel fashion. The parallel closure compresses tissue and evacuates the blood and fluids from the energy pathway in order to make the ablation more effective.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | COBRA Fusion® Surgical Ablation System. The COBRA Fusion Surgical Ablation System’s Versapolar™ technology combines bipolar temperature-controlled radio frequency (TCRF) energy control with monopolar energy. The COBRA Fusion System also incorporates a unique suction design that draws tissue into the device to create consistent, full thickness lesions without arresting and opening the heart.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EPi-Sense® Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® Technology. The EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology is intended for the coagulation of cardiac tissue using RF energy using thoracoscopic, endoscopic and laparoscopic surgical techniques. It may be used for temporary cardiac signal sensing and recording during surgery when connected to an external recording device. The SUBTLE® cannula is an access device and conduit for the ablation device and endoscope to enable a closed chest endoscopic approach. This allows surgeons direct visualization while ablating on the posterior of the heart. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Multifunctional Pens and Linear Ablation Devices. Multifunctional pens are disposable RF devices that come in two configurations—one that makes linear ablations and one that makes spot ablations. The pens enable surgeons to evaluate cardiac arrhythmias, perform temporary cardiac pacing, sensing and stimulation and ablate cardiac tissue with the same device. When the multifunctional pens are used, surgeons are able to toggle back and forth between temporary pacing, sensing, stimulation and ablation. Surgeons generally use one or more of our pen devices in combination with Isolator Synergy clamps. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our linear ablation devices are disposable bi-polar linear RF ablation devices designed to allow physicians to create an expanded cardiac ablation lesion set. These devices also include recording electrodes which allow for pacing, sensing and stimulation independent of the ablation. We believe physicians are using these devices in order to improve long-term results for patients who have non-paroxysmal forms of Afib. 

2.) | cryoICE Cryoablation System. The cryoICE cryoablation system consists of the cryoICE BOX generator along with a range of cryoICE single use and reusable cryosurgery probes. The cryoICE cryoablation system is used to ablate cardiac tissue for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The probes come in a variety of configurations, with the primary difference being flexibility of the distal end of the probe. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Product line for left atrial appendage management:

1.) | AtriClip System. The AtriClip system is designed to occlude the left atrial appendage by mechanically clamping the appendage from the outside, eliminating blood flow between the left atrial appendage and the atrium while avoiding contact with circulating blood. We believe that the AtriClip system is potentially safer, more effective and easier to use than other available products and techniques for permanently excluding the left atrial appendage. The AtriClip portfolio includes a range of devices with different size clips, as well as different applier lengths and deployment features. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product line for temporary pain management:

1.) | CryoICE CRYO2 Cryoablation System. This system is used to apply cryo-energy to targeted intercostal peripheral nerves in the ribcage and temporarily relieve pain. This technique, called cryoanalgesia, is applied intra-operatively by the cardiothoracic surgeon and results in temporary pain relief for 30-60 days post-operatively and after discharge from the hospital. Sensation typically returns to the affected region of the chest after this period. Studies are ongoing to characterize the effects of cryoanalgesia and further refine the procedure.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition to the above product lines we also sell enabling technologies including our Lumitip™ dissectors, the Fusion Magnetic Retriever System and a line of reusable cardiac surgery (valve) instruments. The Lumitip dissector is used by surgeons to separate tissues to provide access to key anatomical structures that are targeted for ablation. The Fusion Magnetic Retriever System™ allows access around key anatomical structures and facilitates positioning of the Cobra Fusion Surgical Ablation System™. Cardiac surgery instruments are used during certain surgical procedures for repair or replacement of heart valves.
 Current Afib Treatment Alternatives
 Physicians usually begin treating Afib patients with a variety of drugs intended to prevent blood clots, control heart rate or restore the heart to normal sinus rhythm. If a patient’s Afib cannot be adequately controlled with drug therapy, doctors may perform one of several procedures that vary depending on the severity of the Afib symptoms and whether or not the patient suffers from other forms of heart disease. 
 Alternative treatments to open-heart and minimally invasive procedures include: 

· | Drugs. Pharmaceutical options called anti-arrhythmics are available to treat Afib. Depending on a patient’s severity of the disease and heart condition, physicians typically administer these medications in a hospital setting with continuous monitoring. If the patient goes back into a normal rhythm, the physician will often prescribe a similar anti-arrhythmic drug to try to prevent a recurrence of Afib. The effectiveness of drug therapy varies based on the patient population and the drug being prescribed, among other factors. Often, pharmaceuticals to thin the blood (anti-coagulants) are prescribed due to the increased risk of stroke for patients who also have Afib.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implantable Devices. Implantable devices, such as defibrillators and pacemakers, can be effective in reducing the symptoms of Afib episodes, but neither device is intended to treat Afib. Patients may continue to experience the adverse effects of Afib as well as some of the symptoms and complications, including dizziness, fatigue, palpitations and stroke, because the Afib continues.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Catheter Ablation. Catheter ablation is a procedure that is typically performed by an electrophysiologist. The ablations are made from the inside of the heart using a flexible catheter. The heart is reached via a blood vessel, most commonly through the femoral vein. In proportion to the prevalence of Afib, only a small number of catheter-based Afib treatments are performed each year in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  With the exception of the Isolator Synergy System, which may be promoted according to its FDA-approved indication for patients with persistent and long-standing persistent Afib undergoing certain open-heart procedures, we do not promote our products specifically for Afib treatment in the United States. Nevertheless, some physicians have adopted our products for use in open-heart and minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of Afib. During elective open-heart surgical procedures, such as bypass or valve surgery, cardiothoracic surgeons use our ablation systems to treat patients with a pre-existing history of Afib. Surgeons use our products to perform cardiac procedures that may vary depending on the length of time a patient has been diagnosed with Afib and whether the patient’s Afib is intermittent, known as paroxysmal, or more continuous (non-paroxysmal), which is typically further classified as persistent, long-standing persistent or permanent. Patients who have been diagnosed with Afib for a longer duration and have non-paroxysmal forms of Afib generally receive more extensive ablation procedures than patients who have been diagnosed with Afib for a shorter duration or who have paroxysmal Afib. Additionally, during an open-heart procedure, physicians may use our AtriClip system to occlude the left atrial appendage. 
 For those patients with Afib who do not require a concomitant open-heart surgical procedure, surgeons have used our products for minimally invasive Afib treatment procedures. These procedures have generally been performed through minimally invasive incisions without the need to place patients on a heart-lung bypass machine. 
 Additionally, some physicians are performing various minimally invasive stand-alone procedures which combine epicardial (surgical) ablation (ablation on the outside of the heart) with endocardial ablation and mapping techniques (from the inside of the heart). These combination procedures are often referred to as “hybrid” or “multi-disciplinary” approaches, in that both surgical ablation and catheter ablations are performed. Sometimes, both procedures are performed on the same day or in the same hospital stay, where other times they are performed days or weeks apart.  Physician preference as well as hospital logistics and procedural room availability plays into the decision whether to perform hybrid ablations in a single or a staged setting. Physicians are reporting that they are performing these procedures utilizing certain of our products to primarily treat patients who have non-paroxysmal forms of Afib.

Business Strategy 
 Our mission is to expand the treatment options for patients who suffer from Afib or have a high risk of stroke through the continued development of our technologies and expansion of our product offerings, global commercial expansion and clinical science investments. The key elements of our strategy include: 
 New Product Innovation. Our product development pipeline includes projects which extend and improve our existing products, as well as research and development projects for new technologies. We plan to continue to develop new and innovative products, including those that allow us to enter new market opportunities or expand our growth in existing markets. 
 Invest in Clinical Science and Build Physician Relationships. We continue to invest in landmark clinical trials to validate the long term results of procedures using our products and to support applications to regulatory agencies for expanded indications. We also make clinical research grants to support our product development efforts.
 We have formed consulting relationships with cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists, electrophysiologists and thoracic surgeons who work with us to evaluate and develop our products. Additionally, we have formed advisory boards made up of key opinion leaders (KOLs) in multiple specialties to oversee our training and clinical programs. We are also building these relationships to provide insight regarding treatment trends, input on future product direction and education for providers involved in treating the disease.    In addition, we are partnering with leading surgical and cardiology societies to increase the awareness of Afib treatment options.  In the past two years, both the Society for Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) have released new guidelines on the surgical treatment of Afib, including in both open-heart and minimally-invasive settings. 
 Provide Training and Education. We have recruited and trained sales and physician education professionals to effectively communicate to our customers the unique features and benefits of our technologies as they relate to their indications for use. Our highly trained professionals meet with physicians at institutions around the world to provide education and technical training on the features, benefits and safe and effective use of our products. With the approval of our Isolator Synergy System for the treatment of non-paroxysmal Afib, we instituted a program to train providers on the use of the Isolator Synergy System to treat persistent Afib in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. We believe this training and education program has increased awareness about the surgical treatment of Afib during open-heart procedures, and we will continue to make investments to serve our physician customers. As a result of the educational process, we believe that awareness of our technologies is growing and will result in the increased use of our products. 
 Expand Adoption of Our Minimally Invasive Products. We believe that the catalysts for expanded adoption of our minimally invasive products include procedural advancements, such as the hybrid or multi-disciplinary procedure, and the publication of peer-reviewed articles, which we believe will help validate the successful, long-term use of our products for patients with Afib. We believe that ongoing research activities, including prospective clinical trials, new procedural techniques and anticipated presentations and publications will create an increased demand for our minimally invasive products. 
 Evaluate Acquisition Opportunities. In the past five years, we have acquired two companies that we believe further expand our ability to establish a platform for long-term revenue growth. We expect to continue to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions which make strategic and financial sense.
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are required to support a pre-market approval (PMA) and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, clinical trials for a significant risk device require the prior submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to FDA for approval. An IDE application must be submitted before initiating a new clinical trial. Some trials require a feasibility study followed by a pivotal trial. An IDE supplement is utilized as a means of obtaining approval to initiate a pivotal trial following the conclusion of a feasibility trial. We are conducting several clinical trials to validate the long-term results of procedures using our products and to support applications to regulatory agencies for expanded indications. In addition, we also conduct various studies to gather clinical data regarding our products. Key trials and studies are:
 CONVERGE. We are conducting the CONVERGE IDE clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EPi-Sense® Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® technology to treat symptomatic persistent Afib patients who are refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I and/or III anti-arrhythmic drug. We have FDA approval to enroll up to 153 patients at 27 domestic medical centers and three international medical centers. Enrollment began in 2014, and there are currently 108 patients enrolled and 24 domestic medical centers and one international medical center initiated. We received FDA approval to use a Sub-Xyphoid approach as an alternative surgical approach during the third quarter of 2017.
 DEEP AF Pivotal Study. The DEEP AF IDE pivotal trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Isolator Synergy System when used in a staged approach, where a minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 90-120 days later. We have FDA approval to enroll up to 220 patients at 23 domestic medical centers and two international medical centers. Enrollment was temporarily suspended beginning in May 2016 while we

evaluated changes to the trial protocol with FDA. We received FDA approval on the updated trial protocol during the third quarter of 2017. Six domestic medical centers have resumed participation in the study and five patients have been enrolled. Total enrollment in the trial is currently 47 patients.
 ATLAS. The ATLAS study is a non-IDE randomized pilot study evaluating outcomes of patients with risk factors for developing postoperative Afib as well as risk of bleeding on oral anticoagulation. There are two types of patients subject to this study:  those with a postoperative Afib diagnosis and receiving prophylactic exclusion of the left atrial appendage with the AtriClip device concomitant to cardiac surgery and those with a postoperative Afib diagnosis who are medically managed. The study provides for enrollment up to 2,000 patients at up to 40 medical centers. Enrollment began in February 2016, and there are currently 517 patients enrolled and twenty-three medical centers initiated. Enrollment is expected to end in 2018.
 FROST. We are conducting a cryoanalgesia study, which is a non-IDE randomized pilot study evaluating whether intraoperative intercostal cryoanalgesia in conjunction with standard of care provides improved analgesic efficacy in patients undergoing unilateral thoracotomy cardiac procedures as compared to the current standard of care. The study involves treatment arm patients who receive intercostal cryoanalgesia in conjunction with standard post-operative pain management and control arm patients who receive standard post-operative pain management only. The study provides for enrollment of up to 100 patients at five medical centers. We began enrollment in June 2016, and there are currently 61 patients enrolled and four medical centers initiated. 
 CEASE AF. We are also pursuing a non-IDE trial in Europe to compare staged hybrid ablation treatment (minimally invasive surgical ablation procedure is first performed and the patient undergoes the intracardiac catheter procedure approximately 91-180 days later) versus catheter ablation alone. We expect the study to have an enrollment of approximately 210 patients at twelve sites. There are currently 90 patients enrolled and eleven medical centers initiated.
 Sales, Marketing and Medical Education 
 Our global sales and marketing efforts focus on educating physicians about our unique technologies and their technical benefits. We only promote our products for uses described in their regulatory agency approved or cleared labeling. We train our sales force on the use of our products to the extent the products are cleared or approved.
 Our sales team in the United States has approximately 125 employees supporting approximately 52 sales territories. We select our sales personnel based on their expertise, sales experience and reputation in the medical device industry, and their knowledge of cardiac surgery procedures and technologies.
 We market and sell our products in selected markets outside of the United States through independent distributors and through our European subsidiaries which include a combination of independent distributors and direct sales personnel. Our international sales team includes sales representatives focused on our direct markets, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Benelux region. We also have a network of distributors in Asia, South America and Canada, as well as certain countries in Europe, who market and sell our products. We continue to evaluate opportunities for further expansion into markets outside of the United States. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more established and developed than ours. Our primary competitor is Medtronic, plc. We and our competitors provide products that have been adopted by physicians for the treatment of Afib and related conditions. Several of our competitors offer intracardiac catheter devices that are commonly used by electrophysiologists to treat Afib. Some of these catheter devices are FDA-approved to treat the paroxysmal form of Afib, but they are not FDA-approved to treat persistent or long-standing persistent Afib. AtriCure’s Isolator Synergy System is the only medical device FDA approved to treat Afib in a surgical setting, and the only medical device approved to treat persistent or long-standing persistent Afib in a concomitant setting. We believe that our products compare favorably against competing products during both open-heart and minimally invasive procedures. We also believe that our products compare favorably to intracardiac catheter devices when used to treat non-paroxysmal forms of Afib. Further, we believe our AtriClip system is an ideal medical device indicated for exclusion of the LAA. 
 To compete effectively, we strive to demonstrate that our products are an attractive alternative to other treatments by differentiating our products on the basis of safety, efficacy, performance, ease of use, reputation, service and price. We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who prefer products offered by our competitors. 
 Third-Party Reimbursement
 Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors. These payors include private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program, the largest single payor in the United States, is a federal health benefit program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and covers certain medical care items and services for eligible beneficiaries, such as individuals over 65 years old, as well as chronically disabled individuals. Because Medicare beneficiaries comprise a large percentage of the populations for which our products are used, and private insurers 

 
6

 

may follow the coverage and payment policies for Medicare, Medicare’s coding, coverage and payment policies for cardiothoracic surgical procedures are significant to our business. 
 Medicare’s Part A program pays hospitals for inpatient services, such as cardiothoracic surgery, under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which provides a predetermined payment based on the patient’s discharge diagnoses and surgical procedure(s). Discharge diagnoses are grouped into Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groupings (MS-DRG). There are several cardiac surgery MS-DRGs associated with the surgical treatment of Afib, with and without a concomitant open-heart procedure. When an ablation device and/or LAA exclusion device is used during a concomitant open-heart procedure, Medicare’s hospital reimbursement is based upon the patient’s primary surgical procedure. Reimbursement for sole-therapy minimally invasive ablation procedures is also influenced by the patient’s severity of illness. We believe hospital reimbursement rates for sole therapy and concomitant therapy cardiac surgical tissue ablation are adequate to cover the cost of our products. 
 Physicians are reimbursed for their services separately under the Medicare Part B physician fee schedule. When surgically performing a cardiac ablation with and without a concomitant open-heart procedure, surgeons report Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to receive a professional fee. Surgeons have a choice of CPT codes to report sole-therapy and concomitant therapy cardiac tissue ablation. At this time, there are no CPT codes for the physician to report surgical exclusion of the left atrial appendage.    In addition to the Medicare program, many private payors look to CMS policies as a guideline in setting their coverage policies and payment amounts. The current coverage policies of these private payors may differ from the Medicare program, and payment rates may be higher, lower, or the same as the Medicare program. In some cases, certain private payors adopt negative coverage policies with respect to therapies involving our products. We engage with a third-party reimbursement consultant that provides support to our customers in the event of a coverage denial.
 Outside of the United States, third-party reimbursement varies widely by geography and by the type of therapy in which our devices are used.  For example, even though a new medical device may have been approved for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement. In some countries, cost containment initiatives and health care reforms include initiatives like governmental reviews of reimbursement rate benchmarks, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures. We are actively working to pursue market access initiatives in certain geographies, which includes applying for new reimbursement for therapies in which our devices are being used. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our products are medical devices and are subject to regulation in the United States by FDA and other federal agencies, and by comparable authorities in other countries. All of our products marketed in the United States have been cleared by FDA pursuant to section 510(k) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA). In addition, our Isolator Synergy System has received premarket approval from FDA for the treatment of patients with persistent and long-standing persistent Afib concomitant to another open-heart surgical procedure such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or cardiac valve replacement or repair. 
  FDA regulations govern nearly all of the activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. The activities that FDA regulates include the following: 

· | product design, development and manufacture;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | pre-clinical testing in animals and in the laboratory;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | clinical investigations in humans;
--+-----------------------------------


· | premarket clearance or approval;
--+---------------------------------


· | record keeping and document retention procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


· | the import and export of products;
--+-----------------------------------


· | product marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | post-marketing surveillance and medical device reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, device malfunctions or other adverse events; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corrective actions, removals and recalls.
--+------------------------------------------

  Unless an exemption applies, most medical devices distributed commercially in the United States require either 510(k) clearance or PMA from FDA.

510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a notification to FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, i.e., a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, in connection with safety and effectiveness, approval of a PMA. FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. 
 Premarket Approval Pathway. A PMA must be submitted to FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and is not otherwise exempt. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 
 After a PMA is submitted and FDA has determined that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, FDA will accept the application for filing. During the review period, FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. Any approvals we receive may be limited in scope or may be contingent upon further post-approval study commitments or other conditions. New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for significant modification to the device, including indicated use, manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to current good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the written informed consent of patients in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and, in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. 
 Educational Grants. FDA regulates manufacturers of medical devices and, in particular, the promotion of medical devices by manufacturers. FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine or the conduct or content of medical education conducted by third parties. Manufacturers may provide financial support for such third-party medical education programs in the form of educational grants intended to offset the cost of such programs. If the manufacturer controls or unduly influences the content of such programs, FDA considers those programs to be promotional activities by the manufacturer and thus subject to FDA regulation including promotional restrictions. We seek to ensure that the activities we support pursuant to our educational grants program are in accordance with FDA criteria for independent educational activities. However, we cannot provide an assurance that FDA or other government authorities would view the programs we have supported as being independent.    Pervasive and Continuing Regulation. There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product is cleared or approved. These include: 

· | FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the false or misleading promotion or the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requirements to obtain clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers comply with reporting requirements of FDA and report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | post-market surveillance regulations which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requirements to issue notices of correction or removal, or conduct market withdrawals or recalls where quality or other issues arise.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Under FDA’s MedWatch regulation, we must submit a Medical Device Report (MDR) to FDA within 30 days whenever we receive information that reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or that one of our products malfunctioned in a manner which, if the malfunction were to recur, could cause or contribute to a death or 

 
8

 

serious injury. Our products are often used to treat very ill patients in highly complex surgeries, only a small portion of which may involve our products, and it is frequently difficult to determine whether our products caused or contributed to a patient injury or death that occurred during or after the procedure. If we are able to determine that our product caused or potentially contributed to a death or serious injury in the particular case, or that a malfunction of the type reported would cause death or serious injury, we submit an MDR on the case. Other incidents, including serious injuries or deaths, which occurred during procedures utilizing our products and that are not the subject of MDRs, may occur either because we are not aware of those incidents or because our investigation determined that the incident did not involve a malfunction of an AtriCure device and/or that an AtriCure device did not cause or contribute to a serious injury or death.
 In addition to FDA regulation, the advertising and promotion of medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, some promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the Federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 
 We have registered with FDA as a medical device manufacturer and listed our devices. FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by FDA and our Notified Body to determine our compliance with the QSR, the European Union’s Medical Device Directive (MDD) and other regulations. Such inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. 
 Fraud, Abuse and False Claims. We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 The Federal False Claims Act (FCA) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the United States Government. Damages under the FCA consist of the imposition of fines and penalties, and can be significant. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), on behalf of the government, has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers included the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward. 
 The Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) is one of the primary voluntary United States trade associations for medical device manufacturers. This association has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the Office of the Inspector General and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption and may look to the AdvaMed Code, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. We have adopted the AdvaMed Code and incorporated its principles in our standard operating procedures, sales force training programs, and relationships with medical professionals. In addition, we have conducted training sessions for employees on these principles.
 Regulation Outside of the United States. Sales of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain certification or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval and the requirements may be different. 
 In the European Union, various directives and voluntary standards regulate the design, manufacture and labeling of medical devices. Devices may only be placed on the market in the European Union if they comply with the essential requirements of a relevant directive and bear the CE mark. Manufacturers must demonstrate that their devices comply with the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The method for assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment will include a review of documentation relating to the device and may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure allows a manufacturer to issue a declaration of conformity with the requirements of the relevant directive and affix the CE mark to the device. Devices that bear the CE mark may be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union and other countries that comply with or mirror the medical device directives. A notified body has granted us a certificate of compliance with the International Organization for

Standardization, (ISO) 13485:2003 Quality Management System. Compliance with this standard establishes the presumption that our quality system conforms with the essential requirements or the relevant directive. We have successfully completed the conformity assessment procedure and affixed the CE mark to our Isolator Synergy clamps, Isolator Synergy pens, Coolrail linear pen, cryosurgery devices, AtriClip LAA Exclusion System, COBRA Fusion Ablation System, Numeris System and the EPi-Sense Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax technology.
 Intellectual Property 
 Protection of our intellectual property is a priority for our business and we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our interests. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights in the continued development and commercialization of our technologies and products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, is important to our continued success. We will be able to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks or copyrights, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. 
 We hold numerous issued United States and international patents. We also have multiple pending United States and international patent applications. We seek patent protection relating to technologies and products we develop in both the United States and in selected foreign countries. While we own much of our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information, we also license patents and related technology of importance to the commercialization of our products. For example, to continue developing and commercializing our current and future products, we may license intellectual property from commercial or academic entities to obtain the rights to technology that is required for our research, development and commercialization activities. 
 All of our employees and technical consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also generally require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived in connection with their relationship with us. We devote significant resources to obtaining patents and other intellectual property and protecting our other proprietary information. If valid and enforceable, these patents may give us a means of blocking competitors from using infringing technology to compete directly with our products. We also have proprietary information that may not be patentable. With respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, we have chosen to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. 
 Manufacturing 
 We assemble, inspect, test and package the majority of our products at our facility in Ohio, and our products are sterilized by third parties. Purchased components are generally available from more than one supplier. However, some products, such as our RF generators and Fusion and EPi-Sense products, are critical components of our RF ablation lines and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply available. 
 Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of our components. 
 We regularly audit our suppliers for compliance with our quality system requirements, the QSR and/or applicable ISO standards. We are an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer and certified to ISO 13485:2003. In addition, we have successfully participated in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) and have been certified accordingly. The MDSAP program is recognized in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States. 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control. 
 Consulting Relationships 
 We have developed consulting relationships with scientists and physicians throughout the world to support our research and development, clinical and training and education programs. We work closely with these thought leaders to understand unmet needs and emerging applications for the treatment of Afib. 
 Our physician consulting agreements are intended to satisfy the requirements of the personal services “Safe Harbor” regulation as well as the AdvaMed and Eucomed Codes. As such, they provide for payment of a fair market value fee only for legitimate services rendered to us. We do not expect or require the consultant to utilize or promote our products, and consultants are required to disclose their relationship with us as appropriate, such as when publishing an article in which one of our products is discussed. Amounts paid to physicians in the United States are disclosed by us in annual reports submitted to CMS under the federal “Open Payments” law.
