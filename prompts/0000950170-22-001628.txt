Item 1.  Business
GENERAL
Hercules Capital, Inc. is a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to high-growth, innovative venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in a variety of technology, life sciences and sustainable and renewable technology industries. Our goal is to be the leading structured debt financing provider for venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in technology-related industries requiring sophisticated and customized financing solutions. Our strategy is to evaluate and invest in a broad range of technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology and to offer a full suite of growth capital products.
Our primary business objectives are to increase our net income, net investment income, and net asset value (“NAV”) by investing in debt, typically with warrants or equity, of venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in a variety of technology-related industries at attractive current yields and the potential for equity appreciation and realized gains. We aim to achieve our business objectives by maximizing our portfolio total return through generation of current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our warrant and equity investments. Our equity ownership in our portfolio companies may exceed 25% of the voting securities of such companies, which represents a controlling interest under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”). In some cases, we receive the right to make additional equity investments in our portfolio companies in connection with future equity financing rounds. Capital that we provide is generally used for growth and general working capital purposes as well as in select cases for acquisitions or recapitalizations. We invest primarily in private companies but also have investments in public companies.
Our investments are focused in companies that are active in a variety of technology industry sub-sectors or are characterized by products or services that require advanced technologies, including, but not limited to, computer software and hardware, networking systems, semiconductors, semiconductor capital equipment, information technology infrastructure or services, internet consumer and business services, telecommunications, telecommunications equipment, media, life sciences, and renewable or alternative energy. Within the life sciences sub-sector, we generally focus on medical devices, bio-pharmaceutical, drug discovery and development, drug delivery, health care services and information systems companies. Within the sustainable and renewable technology sub-sector, we focus on sustainable and renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency and monitoring technologies. We refer to all of these companies as “technology-related” companies and intend, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of the value of our total assets in such businesses.
    3
 
We invest primarily in structured debt with warrants and, to a lesser extent, in senior debt and equity investments. We use the term “structured debt with warrants” to refer to any debt investment, such as a senior or subordinated secured loan, that is coupled with an equity component, including warrants, options or other rights to purchase or convert into common or preferred stock. Our structured debt with warrants investments typically are secured by some or all of the assets of the portfolio company. We also invest in “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt, generally in a first lien position. In addition to our debt investments, we regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions to explore all alternatives. Through such alternatives, we may acquire an investment, a portfolio of investments, an entire company, or sell portions of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis.
We, our subsidiaries or our affiliates, may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions, which may include, depending on the transaction and without limitation, the approval of our Board of Directors (the "Board"), required regulatory or third-party consents, and/or the approval of our stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction.
 CORPORATE STRUCTURE
 We are an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. As a BDC, we must also meet a coverage ratio of total net assets to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings (including accrued interest payable) except for debentures issued by the Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 150% subsequent to each borrowing or issuance of senior securities. Certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are licensed to operate as a small business investment company (a “SBIC” or “SBICs”) under the authority of the SBA. Through SBIC licensed vehicles we may access capital from the SBA debenture program. See “Regulation” for additional information related to our capital requirements.
We are internally managed under the supervision of our Board. We do not pay management or advisory fees, but instead incur costs customary for an operating company. Some of those costs include recruiting and marketing expenses as well as the costs associated with employing management, investment and portfolio management professionals, and technology, secretarial and other support personnel. In connection with our recruiting, branding and marketing efforts, we may, among other things, make charitable contributions in amounts we believe to be immaterial and that do not exceed $500 thousand in the aggregate in any year. We believe that many of these contributions help us raise our profile in the communities and benefit us in attracting and retaining talent and investment opportunities.
 Effective January 1, 2006, we elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“the Code”). As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses) we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders with respect to that taxable year. We will be subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income and gains unless we make distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a timely manner to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year subject to certain requirements as defined for RICs. See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for additional information. Additionally, we have established wholly owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments.
 In May 2020, Hercules Adviser LLC (the “Adviser Subsidiary”) was formed as a wholly owned Delaware limited liability subsidiary to provide investment advisory and related services to investment vehicles (“Adviser Funds”) owned by one or more unrelated third-party investors (“External Parties”). The Adviser Subsidiary receives fee income for the services provided to the Adviser Funds. The Company was granted no-action relief by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to allow the Adviser Subsidiary to register as a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (“Advisers Act”). See “— Regulation—No-action and Exemptive Relief Obtained” for additional information regarding our Adviser Subsidiary.

OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITY
 We believe that technology-related companies compete in one of the largest and most rapidly growing sectors of the U.S. economy and that continued growth is supported by ongoing innovation and performance improvements in technology products as well as the adoption of technology across virtually all industries in response to competitive pressures. We believe that an attractive market opportunity exists for a specialty finance company focused primarily on investments in structured debt with warrants in technology-related companies for the following reasons:
 •technology-related companies have generally been underserved by traditional lending sources; 
 •unfulfilled demand exists for structured debt financing to technology-related companies due to the complexity of evaluating risk in these investments; and
 •structured debt with warrants products are less dilutive and complement equity financing from venture capital and private equity funds.
 Technology-Related Companies are Underserved by Traditional Lenders.
We believe many viable technology-related companies backed by financial sponsors have been unable to obtain sufficient growth financing from traditional lenders, including financial services companies such as commercial banks and finance companies because traditional lenders have continued to consolidate and have adopted a more risk-averse approach to lending. More importantly, we believe traditional lenders are typically unable to underwrite the risk associated with these companies effectively.
The unique cash flow characteristics of many technology-related companies typically include significant research and development expenditures and high projected revenue growth thus often making such companies difficult to evaluate from a credit perspective. In addition, the balance sheets of these companies often include a disproportionately large amount of intellectual property assets, which can be difficult to value. Finally, the speed of innovation in technology and rapid shifts in consumer demand and market share add to the difficulty in evaluating technology-related companies.
Due to the difficulties described above, we believe traditional lenders generally refrain from entering the structured debt financing marketplace, instead preferring the risk-reward profile of asset-based lending. Traditional lenders generally do not have flexible product offerings that meet the needs of technology-related companies. The financing products offered by traditional lenders typically impose on borrowers many restrictive covenants and conditions, including limiting cash outflows and requiring a significant depository relationship to facilitate rapid liquidation.
Unfulfilled Demand for Structured Debt Financing to Technology-Related Companies.
Private debt capital in the form of structured debt financing from specialty finance companies continues to be an important source of funding for technology-related companies. We believe that the level of demand for structured debt financing is a function of the level of annual venture equity investment activity.
   5
 
We believe that demand for structured debt financing is currently underserved. The venture capital market for the technology-related companies in which we invest has been active. Therefore, to the extent we have capital available, we believe this is an opportune time to be active in the structured lending market for technology-related companies.
Structured Debt with Warrants Products Complement Equity Financing from Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds.
We believe that technology-related companies and their financial sponsors will continue to view structured debt securities as an attractive source of capital because it augments the capital provided by venture capital and private equity funds. We believe that our structured debt with warrants products provide access to growth capital that otherwise may only be available through incremental investments by existing equity investors. As such, we provide portfolio companies and their financial sponsors with an opportunity to diversify their capital sources. Generally, we believe many technology-related companies at all stages of development target a portion of their capital to be debt in an attempt to achieve a higher valuation through internal growth. In addition, because financial sponsor-backed companies have reached a more mature stage prior to reaching a liquidity event, we believe our investments could provide the debt capital needed to grow or recapitalize during the extended period sometimes required prior to liquidity events.
OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
 Our strategy to achieve our investment objective includes the following key elements:
Leverage the Experience and Industry Relationships of Our Management Team and Investment Professionals.
We have assembled a team of experienced investment professionals with extensive experience as venture capitalists, commercial lenders, and originators of structured debt and equity investments in technology-related companies. Our investment professionals have, on average, more than 10 years of experience as equity investors in, and/or lenders to, technology-related companies. In addition, our team members have originated structured debt, debt with warrants and equity investments in over 500 technology-related companies, representing more than $13.0 billion in commitments from inception to December 31, 2021, and have developed a network of industry contacts with investors and other participants within the venture capital and private equity communities. Members of our management team also have operational, research and development and finance experience with technology-related companies. Furthermore, we have established contacts with leading venture capital and private equity fund sponsors, public and private companies, research institutions and other industry participants, which we believe will enable us to identify and attract well-positioned prospective portfolio companies.
 We focus our investing activities generally in industries in which our investment professionals have investment experience. We believe that our focus on financing technology-related companies will enable us to leverage our expertise in structuring prospective investments, to assess the value of both tangible and intangible assets, to evaluate the business prospects and operating characteristics of technology-related companies and to identify and originate potentially attractive investments with these types of companies.
Mitigate Risk of Principal Loss and Build a Portfolio of Warrant and Equity Securities.
We expect that our investments have the potential to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns through current income, in the form of interest and fee income, as well as capital appreciation from warrant and equity securities. We believe that we can mitigate the risk of loss on our debt investments through the combination of loan principal amortization after an initial interest only period, cash interest payments, relatively short maturities (typically between 36-48 months), security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies, and on select investment covenants requiring prospective portfolio companies to have certain amounts of available cash at the time of our investment and the continued support from a venture capital or private equity firm at the time we make our investment. Although we do not currently engage in hedging transactions, we may engage in hedging transactions in the future utilizing instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars, and floors.
Historically our structured debt investments to technology-related companies typically include warrants or other equity interests, giving us the potential to realize equity-like returns on a portion of our investment. In addition, in some cases, we receive the right to make additional equity investments in our portfolio companies, including the right to convert some portion of our debt into equity, in connection with future equity financing rounds. We believe these equity interests will create the potential for meaningful long-term capital gains in connection with the future liquidity events of these technology-related companies.

Provide Customized Financing Complementary to Financial Sponsors’ Capital.
We offer a broad range of investment structures and possess expertise and experience to effectively structure and price investments in technology-related companies. Unlike many of our competitors that only invest in companies that fit a specific set of investment parameters, we have the flexibility to structure our investments to suit the particular needs of our portfolio companies. We offer customized financing solutions ranging from senior debt, including below-investment grade debt instruments, also known as “junk bonds”, to equity capital, with a focus on structured debt with warrants.
We use our relationships in the financial sponsor community to originate investment opportunities. Because venture capital and private equity funds typically invest solely in the equity securities of their portfolio companies, we believe that our debt investments will be viewed as an attractive and complimentary source of capital, both by the portfolio company and by the portfolio company’s financial sponsor. In addition, we believe that many venture capital and private equity fund sponsors encourage their portfolio companies to use debt financing for a portion of their capital needs as a means of potentially enhancing equity returns, minimizing equity dilution and increasing valuations prior to a subsequent equity financing round or a liquidity event.
Invest at Various Stages of Development.
We provide growth capital to technology-related companies at all stages of development, including select publicly listed companies and select special opportunity lower middle market companies that require additional capital to fund acquisitions, recapitalizations and refinancings and established-stage companies. We believe that this provides us with a broader range of potential investment opportunities than those available to many of our competitors, who generally focus their investments on a particular stage in a company’s development. Because of the flexible structure of our investments and the extensive experience of our investment professionals, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these investment opportunities at all stages of prospective portfolio companies’ development.
Benefit from Our Efficient Organizational Structure.
We believe that the perpetual nature of our corporate structure enables us to be a long-term partner for our portfolio companies in contrast to traditional investment funds, which typically have a limited life. In addition, because of our access to the equity markets, we believe that we may benefit from a lower cost of capital than that available to private investment funds. We are not subject to requirements to return invested capital to investors nor do we have a finite investment horizon. Capital providers that are subject to such limitations are often required to seek a liquidity event more quickly than they otherwise might, which can result in a lower overall return on an investment.
Deal Sourcing Through Our Proprietary Database.
We have developed a proprietary and comprehensive database to track various aspects of our investment process including sourcing, originations, transaction monitoring and post-investment performance. As of December 31, 2021, our proprietary database included more than 55,000 technology-related companies and more than 13,000 venture capital firms, private equity sponsors or investors, as well as various other industry contacts. This proprietary database allows us to maintain, cultivate and grow our industry relationships while providing us with comprehensive details on companies in the technology-related industries and their financial sponsors.
OUR INVESTMENTS AND OPERATIONS
We principally invest in debt securities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities, with a particular emphasis on structured debt with warrants. We generally seek to invest in companies that have been operating for at least six to twelve months prior to the date of our investment. We anticipate that such entities may, at the time of investment, be generating revenues or will have a business plan that anticipates generation of revenues within 24 to 48 months. Further, we anticipate that on the date of our investment we will generally obtain a lien on available assets, which may or may not include intellectual property, and these companies will have sufficient cash on their balance sheet to operate as well as potentially amortize their debt for at least three to nine months following our investment. We generally require that a prospective portfolio company, in addition to having sufficient capital to support leverage, demonstrate an operating plan capable of generating cash flows or raising the additional capital necessary to cover its operating expenses and service its debt, for an additional six to twelve months subject to market conditions.
   7
 
We expect that our investments will generally range from $15.0 million to $40.0 million, although we may make investments in amounts above or below this range. We typically structure our debt securities to provide for amortization of principal over the life of the loan, but may include a period of interest-only payments. Our loans will typically be collateralized by a security interest in the borrower’s assets, although we may not have the first claim on these assets and the assets may not include intellectual property. Our debt investments carry fixed or variable contractual interest rates which generally ranged from approximately 7.0% to 14.5% as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 94.0% of our loans were at floating rates or floating rates with a floor and 6.0% of the loans were at fixed rates as of December 31, 2021.
In addition to the cash yields received on our loans, our loans generally include one or more of the following: exit fees, balloon payment fees, commitment fees, success fees, or prepayment fees. In some cases, our loans also include contractual payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest arrangements. The increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements are included in income for the period in which such PIK interest was accrued, which is often in advance of receiving cash payment, and are separately identified on our statements of cash flows. We also may be required to include in income for tax purposes certain other amounts prior to receiving the related cash.
In addition, our investments in the structured debt of venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies generally have equity enhancement features, typically in the form of warrants or other equity securities that are considered original issue discounts ("OID") to our loans and are designed to provide us with an opportunity for potential capital appreciation. The warrants typically will be immediately exercisable upon issuance and generally will remain exercisable for the lesser of five to ten years or three to five years after completion of an initial public offering (“IPO”). The exercise prices for the warrants varies from nominal exercise prices to exercise prices that are at or above the current fair market value of the equity for which we receive warrants. We may structure warrants to provide minority rights provisions or, on a very select basis, put rights upon the occurrence of certain events. We generally target a total annualized return (including interest, fees and value of warrants) of 12% to 25% for our debt investments.
Typically, our structured debt and equity investments take one of the following forms:
•Structured Debt with Warrants. We seek to invest a majority of our assets in structured debt with warrants of prospective portfolio companies. Our investments in structured debt with warrants may be the only debt capital on the balance sheet of our portfolio companies, and in many cases we have a first priority security interest in all of our portfolio company’s assets, or in certain investments we may have a negative pledge on intellectual property. Our structured debt with warrants typically has a maturity of between two and five years, and it may provide for full amortization after an interest only period. Our structured debt with warrants generally carries a contractual interest rate up to 11.0% and may include an additional exit fee payment or contractual PIK interest arrangements. We may structure our structured debt with warrants with restrictive affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, prepayment penalties, lien protection, equity calls, change-in-control provisions or board observation rights. 
 •Senior Debt. We seek to invest a limited portion of our assets in senior debt. Senior debt may be collateralized by accounts receivable and/or inventory financing of prospective portfolio companies. Senior debt has a senior position with respect to a borrower’s scheduled interest and principal payments and holds a first priority security interest in the assets pledged as collateral. Senior debt also may impose covenants on a borrower with regard to cash flows and changes in capital structure, among other items. We generally collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies’ assets, which may include their intellectual property. In other cases, we may obtain a negative pledge covering a company’s intellectual property. Our senior loans, in certain instances, may be tied to the financing of specific assets. In connection with a senior debt investment, we may also provide the borrower with a working capital line-of-credit that will carry an interest rate ranging from Prime or LIBOR plus a spread with a floor, generally maturing in three to five years, and typically secured by accounts receivable and/or inventory. We also provide “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt, generally in a first lien position with security interest in all the assets of the portfolio company. The loans can either be “first out” or “last out”, whereby the “last-out” loans will be subordinated to the “first-out” portion of the unitranche loan in a liquidation, sale or other disposition.
 •Equity Securities. The equity securities we hold consist primarily of warrants or other equity interests generally obtained in connection with our structured debt investments. In addition to the warrants received as a part of a structured debt financing, we typically receive the right to make equity investments in a portfolio company in connection with that company’s next round of equity financing. We may also hold certain debt investments that have the right to convert a portion of the debt investment into equity. These rights will provide us with the opportunity to further enhance our returns over time through opportunistic equity investments in our portfolio companies. These equity investments are typically in the form of preferred or common equity and may be structured with a dividend yield, providing us with a current return, and with customary anti-dilution protection and preemptive rights. We may achieve liquidity through a merger or acquisition of a portfolio company, a public offering of a portfolio company’s stock or by exercising our right, if any, to require a portfolio company to buy back the equity securities we hold. We may also make stand-alone direct equity 
    8
 
investments into portfolio companies in which we may not have any debt investment in the company. As of December 31, 2021, we held warrant and equity securities in 155 portfolio companies.
In addition to the characteristics described above, the table below compares the typical features of our investments.


 | Structured Debt with Warrants | Senior Debt | Equity Securities 
Typical Structure | Term debt with warrants | Term or revolving debt | Preferred stock or common stock
Investment Horizon | Long-term: 2 to 5 years; Average of 3.5 years | Generally under 4 years | 3 to 7 years 
Covenants | Less restrictive; mostly financial | Generally borrowing base and financial | None 

Investment Criteria 
We have identified several criteria, among others, that we believe are important in achieving our investment objective with respect to prospective portfolio companies. These criteria, while not inclusive, provide general guidelines for our investment decisions.
Portfolio Composition - While we generally focus our investments in venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in a variety of technology-related industries, we seek to invest across various financial sponsors as well as across various stages of companies’ development and various technology industry sub-sectors and geographies. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 80.1% of the fair value of our portfolio was composed of investments in three industries: 39.7% was composed of investments in the "Drug Discovery & Development" industry, 24.1% was composed of investments in the "Software" industry, and 16.3% was composed of investments in the "Internet Consumer & Business Services" industry.
 Continuing Support from One or More Financial Sponsors - We generally invest in companies in which one or more established financial sponsors have previously invested and continue to make a contribution to the management of the business. We believe that having established financial sponsors with meaningful commitments to the business is a key characteristic of a prospective portfolio company. In addition, we look for representatives of one or more financial sponsors to maintain seats on the board of directors of a prospective portfolio company as an indication of such commitment.
Company Stage of Development - While we invest in companies at various stages of development, we generally require that prospective portfolio companies be beyond the seed stage of development and generally have received or anticipate having commitments for their first institutional round of equity financing for early stage companies. We expect a prospective portfolio company to demonstrate progress in its product development or demonstrate a path towards revenue generation or increase its revenues and operating cash flow over time. The anticipated growth rate of a prospective portfolio company is a key factor in determining the value that we ascribe to any warrants or other equity securities that we may acquire in connection with an investment in debt securities.
Operating Plan - We generally require that a prospective portfolio company, in addition to having potential access to capital to support leverage, demonstrate an operating plan capable of generating cash flows or the ability to potentially raise the additional capital necessary to cover its operating expenses and service its debt for a specific period. Specifically, we require that a prospective portfolio company demonstrate at the time of our proposed investment that in addition to having sufficient capital to support leverage, it has an operating plan capable of generating cash flows or raising the additional capital necessary to cover its operating expenses and service its debt for an additional six to twelve months subject to market conditions.
Security Interest - In many instances we seek a first priority security interest in all of the portfolio company’s tangible and intangible assets as collateral for our debt investment, subject in some cases to permitted exceptions. In other cases, we may obtain a negative pledge prohibiting a company from pledging or otherwise encumbering their intellectual property. Although we do not intend to operate as an asset-based lender, the estimated liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing the debt securities that we hold is an important factor in our credit analysis and subject to assumptions that may change over the life of the investment especially when attempting to estimate the value of intellectual property. We generally evaluate both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases.
   9
 
Covenants - Our investments may include one or more of the following covenants: cross-default; material adverse change provisions; requirements that the portfolio company provide periodic financial reports and operating metrics; and limitations on the portfolio company’s ability to incur additional debt, sell assets, dividend recapture, engage in transactions with affiliates and consummate an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger or recapitalization without our consent. In addition, we may require other performance or financial based covenants, as we deem appropriate.
Exit Strategy - Prior to making a debt investment that is accompanied by a warrant or other equity security in a prospective portfolio company, we analyze the potential for that company to increase the liquidity of its equity through a future event that would enable us to realize appreciation in the value of our equity interest. Liquidity events may include an IPO, a private sale of our equity interest to a third party, a merger or an acquisition of the company or a purchase of our equity position by the company or one of its stockholders.
Investment Process
We have organized our management team around the four key elements of our investment process:
•Origination; 
 •Underwriting; 
 •Documentation; and 
 •Loan and Compliance Administration. 
 Our investment process is summarized in the following chart:

   10
 
Origination
The origination process for our investments includes sourcing, screening, preliminary due diligence and deal structuring and negotiation, all leading to an executed non-binding term sheet. As of December 31, 2021, our investment origination team, which consists of approximately 53 investment professionals, is headed by our Chief Investment Officer and Chief Executive Officer. The origination team is responsible for sourcing potential investment opportunities and members of the investment origination team use their extensive relationships with various leading financial sponsors, management contacts within technology-related companies, trade sources, technology conferences and various publications to source prospective portfolio companies. Our investment origination team is divided into life sciences, technology, SaaS finance, sustainable and renewable technology, and special situation sub-teams to better source potential portfolio companies.
In addition, we have developed a comprehensive proprietary database to track various aspects of our investment process including sourcing, originations, transaction monitoring and post-investment performance. Our proprietary database allows our origination team to maintain, cultivate and grow our industry relationships while providing our origination team with comprehensive details on companies in the technology-related industries and their financial sponsors.
If a prospective portfolio company generally meets certain underwriting criteria, we perform preliminary due diligence, which may include high level company and technology assessments, evaluation of its financial sponsors’ support, market analysis, competitive analysis, identifying key management, risk analysis and transaction size, pricing, return analysis and structure analysis. If the preliminary due diligence is satisfactory, and the origination team recommends moving forward, we then structure, negotiate and execute a non-binding term sheet with the potential portfolio company. Upon execution of a term sheet, the investment opportunity moves to the underwriting process to complete formal due diligence review and approval.
Underwriting
The underwriting review includes formal due diligence and approval of the proposed investment in the portfolio company.
Due Diligence - Our due diligence on a prospective investment is typically completed by two or more investment professionals whom we define as the underwriting team. The underwriting team for a proposed investment consists of the deal sponsor who typically possesses general industry knowledge and is responsible for originating and managing the transaction, other investment professionals who perform due diligence, credit and corporate financial analyses and our legal professionals, as needed. To ensure consistent underwriting, we generally use our standardized due diligence methodologies, which include due diligence on financial performance and credit risk as well as an analysis of the operations and the legal and applicable regulatory framework of a prospective portfolio company. The members of the underwriting team work together to conduct due diligence and understand the relationships among the prospective portfolio company’s business plan, operations and financial performance.
As part of our evaluation of a proposed investment, the underwriting team prepares an investment memorandum for presentation to the investment committee. In preparing the investment memorandum, the underwriting team typically interviews select key management of the company and select financial sponsors and assembles information necessary to the investment decision. If and when appropriate, the investment professionals may also contact industry experts and customers, vendors or, in some cases, competitors of the company. The underwriting team collaborates with the credit and legal teams to ensure the final credit underwriting deal structure meets our standards. In addition to the aforementioned members of the investment team, each deal is also assigned to a member of the credit team. The credit team is responsible for making sure that all material risks in the transaction are identified and mitigated to the extent possible in the investment memorandum and that the legal documentation properly reflects the transaction as approved by the investment committee.
 Approval Process - The sponsoring managing director or principal presents the investment memorandum to our investment committee for consideration. The approval of a majority of our investment committee is required before we proceed with any investment. The investment committee members include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and Senior Managing Director of Risk Management. The investment committee meets on an as-needed basis.
Documentation
Our legal department administers the documentation process for our investments. This department is responsible for documenting the transactions approved by our investment committee with a prospective portfolio company. This department negotiates loan documentation and, subject to appropriate approvals, final documents are prepared for execution by all parties. The legal department generally uses the services of external law firms to complete the necessary documentation.
   11
 
Loan and Compliance Administration
Our investment committee, supported by our investment team, credit team, and finance department, administers loans and tracks covenant compliance, if applicable, of our investments and oversees periodic reviews of our critical functions to ensure adherence with our internal policies and procedures. After the funding of a loan in accordance with the investment committee’s approval, the loan is recorded in our loan administration software and our proprietary database. The investment team, credit team, and finance department are responsible for ensuring timely interest and principal payments and collateral management as well as advising the investment committee on the financial performance and trends of each portfolio company, including any covenant violations that occur, to aid us in assessing the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company and evaluating overall portfolio quality. In addition, the investment team and credit team advise the investment committee and the Audit Committee of our Board, accordingly, regarding the credit and investment grading for each portfolio company as well as changes in the value of collateral that may occur.
The investment team and credit team monitor our portfolio companies in order to determine whether the companies are meeting our financing criteria and their respective business plans and also monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company from its monthly or quarterly financial statements to assess the appropriate course of action for each company and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. In addition, our management team closely monitors the status and performance of each individual company through our proprietary database and periodic contact with our portfolio companies’ management teams and their respective financial sponsors.
Credit and Investment Grading System. Our investment and credit teams use an investment grading system to characterize and monitor our outstanding loans. They monitor and when appropriate, recommend changes to investment grading. Our investment committee reviews and approves the recommendations and/or changes to the investment grading. These approved investment gradings are provided on a quarterly basis to the Audit Committee and our Board, along with valuations for our investments which are submitted for approval.
From time to time, we will identify investments that require closer monitoring or become workout assets. We develop a workout strategy for workout assets and our investment committee monitors the progress against the strategy. We may incur losses from our investing activities; however, we work with our troubled portfolio companies to recover as much of our investments as is practicable, including possibly taking control of the portfolio company. There can be no assurance that principal will be recovered.
 We use the following investment grading system approved by our Board:
 
Grade 1 | Loans involve the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk profile is generally favorable. 
Grade 2 | The borrower is performing as expected and the risk profile is neutral to favorable. All new loans are initially graded 2. 
Grade 3 | The borrower may be performing below expectations, and the loan’s risk has increased materially since origination. We typically increase procedures to monitor a borrower when it is determined that credit risk has increased meaningfully since origination, such as, when the borrower is approaching a low liquidity point and an expected capital raise event is not imminent, when an expected milestone has slipped or failed, when performance or new business is materially below our plan, or if the estimated fair value of the enterprise is materially lower than it was when the loan was originated.
Grade 4 | The borrower is performing materially below expectations, and the loan risk has substantially increased since origination with the prospect of raising additional capital significantly in question. Loans graded 4 may experience some partial loss or full return of principal but are expected to realize some loss of interest which is not anticipated to be repaid in full, which, to the extent not already reflected, may require the fair value of the loan to be reduced to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. Grade 4 investments are closely monitored. 
Grade 5 | The borrower is in workout, materially performing below expectations and a significant risk of principal loss is probable. Loans graded 5 will experience some partial principal loss or full loss of remaining principal outstanding is expected. Grade 5 loans will require the fair value of the loans be reduced to the amount, if any, we anticipate will be recovered. 

 As of December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio had a weighted average investment grading of 2.10.

Managerial Assistance
As a BDC we are generally required to offer and provide, upon request, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance, among other things. We may, from time to time, receive fees for these services. In the event that such fees are received, they are incorporated into our operating income and are passed through to our stockholders, given the nature of our structure as an internally managed BDC. See “—Regulation—Significant Managerial Assistance” for additional information.
 COMPETITION
Our primary competitors provide financing to prospective portfolio companies and include non-bank financial institutions, federally or state-chartered banks, venture debt funds, financial institutions, venture capital funds, private equity funds, investment funds and investment banks. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we have, and the 1940 Act imposes certain regulatory restrictions on us as a BDC to which many of our competitors are not subject. However, we believe that few of our competitors possess the expertise to properly structure and price debt investments to venture capital-backed and institutional capital-backed companies in technology-related industries. We believe that our specialization in financing technology-related companies will enable us to determine a range of potential values of intellectual property assets, evaluate the business prospects and operating characteristics of prospective portfolio companies and, as a result, identify investment opportunities that produce attractive risk-adjusted returns. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business Structure—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and we may not be able to compete effectively.”
HUMAN CAPITAL DISCLOSURES
   As an internally managed BDC, we believe that one of the strengths and principal reasons for the long-term success of our company is the quality and dedication of our people. As of December 31, 2021, our team comprises over 90 professionals across our 8 offices globally. Within our team, 53 team members are experienced investment professionals who have on an average more than 10 years of experience in venture capital, structured finance, origination of debt and equity investments, commercial lending and acquisition finance with technology and biomedical companies, as well as our executive officers and treasury, finance, risk management, administrative support, IT and human resources professionals. We leverage the experience and relationships of our management team to successfully identify attractive investment opportunities, underwrite prospective portfolio companies and structure customized financing solutions. From inception to December 31, 2021, our team has originated structured debt, debt with warrants and equity investments in over 500 companies, representing more than $13.0 billion in commitments. Our investment team leverages established contacts with leading venture capital and private equity fund sponsors, public and private companies, research institutions and other industry participants, to identify and source our investments. We believe that leveraging the relationships that our investment teams have established will enable us to continue to identify and attract well-positioned prospective portfolio companies.
   Talent Acquisition and Retention
Our goal is to ensure that we have the right blend of talent supporting our business. We seek to accomplish this goal through our commitment to attracting, developing, and retaining our high quality team. The process by which we attract, recruit and select new members to join our team is strategic and purposeful to ensure our business and culture continue to thrive. As part of our commitment to recruit, develop talent, and provide mentorship, we offer an internship program that invites high quality college students from a diverse pool of institutions to learn our business and contribute to our work as temporary employees for a period of approximately six months. These internships are expected to lead to permanent roles for high performing and high potential interns. Additionally, we aim to recruit a diverse group of interns and analysts, representing different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, by partnering with organizations that help us achieve that goal and that encourage diverse candidates to explore financial services as a career.
  As strategic needs are identified, we contract with employment agencies to hire new members. Through our internship program, individuals who want to join the investment team have the opportunity to see the full investment process from due diligence to closing, as well as ongoing portfolio management activities. Additionally, from time to time, we may contract with independent contractors on a temporary basis.
 The retention of our personnel is important to the management of our business. The departure of key management personnel could adversely affect our business and cause us to lose current and potential investment opportunities. We believe that compensation
   13
 
and benefits are a key part of retaining personnel. As such, we offer a competitive, equitable, compensation and benefits structure that we believe is attractive to our current and prospective professionals relative to their local markets and industry. Our compensation strategy includes, for certain professionals, equity incentive plans, which we have structured to further align the interests of our professionals with our stockholders, and to cultivate a strong sense of ownership and commitment to our Company. As part of our commitment to developing our team and to foster a culture of learning, we provide many training opportunities for our employees to continue to build their skills and increase their effectiveness as members of a team, including offering a variety of external and internal classes and training sessions as well as hands-on learning and one-on-one mentorship. Through our annual goal setting and performance review processes, our employees are annually evaluated by managers and our senior management team to ensure employees continue to develop and advance as expected. As we hire and develop individuals, we also take succession planning into account and have succession plans in place for each of our named executive officers.
 The pandemic has presented new challenges with respect to employee engagement and well-being, both of which are fundamental to the success of our business. The safety of our employees, clients, customers, and vendors remains at the forefront of our decisions regarding when it is safe for employees to return to work in the office. Accordingly, we have allowed employees to work from home in regions where doing so is recommended by local guidance. Following local and CDC guidance, we have made our offices accessible to those who prefer to work in the office, with restrictions and safety protocols in place. Throughout this time, we have made continuous efforts to support our employees with increased dialogue with managers, colleagues and leaders, flexibility to address different working environments and schedules, information regarding stress management and physical and mental health, and virtual engagements. Our Employee Assistance Program provides additional, ongoing support and information for our employees and their families.
       Our Culture
We are committed to fostering a workplace conducive to the open communication of any concerns regarding unethical, fraudulent or illegal activities. We seek to promote a safe environment that is free of harassment or bullying. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind, including, but not limited to, sexual, gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, age, or disability, among others. We seek feedback from employees on matters related to their employment or our operations including its financial statement disclosures, accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. Under our Whistleblower Policy, each director, officer, regular full-time, part-time and temporary employee of the Company has the ability to confidentially report: any questionable or improper accounting, internal controls, auditing matters, disclosure, or fraudulent business practices or other illegal or unethical behavior. We seek to protect the confidentiality of those making reports of possible misconduct and our Whistleblower Policy prohibits retaliation against those who report activities believed in good faith to be a violation of any law, rule, regulation or internal policy.
 Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics establishes applicable policies, guidelines, and procedures that promote ethical practices and conduct by the Company and all its employees, officers, and directors. Upon joining and annually, all employs receive compliance training. Our Whistleblower Policy and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy can be found on our website at investor.htgc.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents.
    Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Hercules, we feel strongly that building a diverse and inclusive team is an important priority. We aim to attract, motivate, and retain a diverse group of individuals and to create an inclusive community where all individuals are welcomed, valued, respected, and heard. We are proud that our workforce consists of diverse professionals including over 60% that are women or people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Over 50% of our senior leaders, which includes our managing directors on the investment team and senior executives are women or people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We strive to continue to create a welcoming and inclusive work environment for our employees.
   Philanthropy
Hercules encourages and supports our employees to be active participants in our local communities. As a Company, we support local non-profit organizations by hosting annual fundraising, food, and toy drives. In addition to our Company sponsored philanthropic initiatives, we also provide employees with paid days off to volunteer at organizations of their choice. Hercules supports a variety of non-profit organizations through corporate sponsorship and donations. In addition, we support our employees and the causes that are most important to them through our Charitable Donation Matching program, in which we match donations our employees make to qualified 501(c)(3) non-profits (subject to maximum limits per employee).
For more information on our approach to social, governance, and environmental topics, please refer to our Environmental, Social and Governance Policy (“ESG Policy”), which can be found on our website at investor.htgc.com/esg.

REGULATION
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The following discussion is a general summary of the material prohibitions and descriptions governing BDCs. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.
Regulation as a Business Development Company
 A BDC primarily focuses on investing in or lending to private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them, while providing its stockholders with the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their directors and officers and principal underwriters and certain other related persons and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:
(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b) is not an investment company (other than a SBIC wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or if it has securities listed on a national securities exchange such company has a market capitalization of less than $250 million; is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of a BDC on its Board; or meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC.
(2) Securities of any portfolio company which we control.
 (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company or has greater than 50% representation on its board.
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company, including other BDCs, that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company (as defined in the 1940 Act), invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one such investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of such other investment companies in the aggregate. SEC rules permit us to exceed these limits, subject to certain conditions. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses.
   15
 
Significant Managerial Assistance
BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we generally would not meet the diversification tests imposed on us by the Code in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. We will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Warrants, Options, and Restricted Stock
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or other rights to purchase or convert into capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock. This amount is reduced to 20% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock if the amount of warrants, options or rights issued pursuant to an executive compensation plan would exceed 15% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock. We have received exemptive relief from the SEC permitting us to issue stock options and restricted stock to our employees and directors subject to the above conditions, among others. For a discussion regarding the conditions of this exemptive relief, see “—No-action and Exemptive Relief” below and "Note 8 - Equity Incentive Plans" to our consolidated financial statements.
Reduced Asset Coverage Requirements
 In accordance with the Small Business Credit Availability Act ("SBCAA"), our Board and stockholders approved the reduction of our minimum asset coverage ratio applicable under Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act on September 4, 2018 and December 6, 2018, respectively. As a result, effective December 7, 2018, the minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act applicable to us decreased from 200% to 150%, permitting us to incur additional leverage.
 Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio
We will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, we may not be permitted to declare any cash dividend distribution on our outstanding common shares, or purchase any such shares, unless, at the time of such declaration or purchase, we have asset coverage of at least 150% after deducting the amount of such distribution or purchase price. On April 5, 2007, we received approval from the SEC on our request for exemptive relief that permits us to exclude the indebtedness of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are SBICs from the 150% asset coverage requirement applicable to us. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with the resulting leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Structure—Because we have substantial indebtedness, there could be increased risk in investing in our company.”
    16
 
Capital Structure
Subject to limited exceptions, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price per share below NAV. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or other rights to acquire such common stock, at a price below the current NAV if our Board determines that such sale is in the best interests of our stockholders and if stockholders, including a majority of those stockholders that are not affiliated with us, approve of such sale.
 In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of the Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distribution commission or discount). We do not currently have authorization from our stockholders to issue common stock at a price below its then current NAV per share.
Other 1940 Act Regulations
 As a closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, we are periodically examined by, and required to submit information to, the SEC for compliance with the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. We are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. We are required by the 1940 Act to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. We are also required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
 Code of Ethics
We have adopted and will maintain a code of ethics that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from conducting certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC.
Our current code of ethics is posted on our website at investor.htgc.com/corporate-governance/governance.documents. In addition, the code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Privacy Principles
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent).
We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to our employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of our stockholders. Our proxy voting decisions are made by members of the Company's investment team, who review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. We generally
   17
 
do not believe it is necessary to engage the services of an independent third party to assist in issue analysis and vote recommendation for proxy proposals.
To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
 Small Business Administration Regulations
We make investments in qualifying small businesses through wholly owned SBIC subsidiaries. SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and have average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, SBICs must devote 25.0% of its investment activity to “smaller” enterprises as defined by the SBA. A smaller enterprise is one that has a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and has average annual fully taxed net income not exceeding $2.0 million for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services.
Each SBIC subsidiary is subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. As part of the SBA's oversight, each SBIC is periodically examined and audited by the SBA’s staff to determine their compliance with SBA regulations. If any of our SBICs fails to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit our SBICs' use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit our SBICs from making new investments. In addition, our SBICs may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to us if they do not have sufficient capital in accordance with SBA regulations. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively impact us because our SBICs are wholly owned subsidiaries. Further, the SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. SBA regulations also include restrictions on a “change of control” or transfer of an SBIC and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. As of December 31, 2021, as a result of having sufficient capital as defined under the SBA regulations, our SBICs were in compliance with the terms of the SBA’s leverage requirements.
 The receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that a SBIC will receive SBA guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon our SBICs continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBICs’ assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBICs or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by our SBICs upon an event of default.
 Compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. For example:
 •pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
 •pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
 •pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which must be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm;
 •pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
 
   18
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 
Compliance with The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Corporate Governance Regulations
 
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “HTGC”. As a listed company on the NYSE, we are subject to various listing standards including corporate governance listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We intend to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and to take all necessary actions to ensure that we stay in compliance.
Brokerage Allocations and Other Practices
 Because we generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, we typically do not use brokers in the normal course of business. However, from time to time, we may work with brokers to sell positions we have acquired in the securities of publicly listed companies or to acquire positions (principally equity) in companies where we see a market opportunity to acquire such securities at attractive valuations. In cases where we do use a broker, we do not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but will seek to obtain the best net results for the Company, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While we generally seek reasonably competitive execution costs, we may not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, we may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to us. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if we determine in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.
No-action and Exemptive Relief Obtained
 On May 11, 2020, we received no-action relief from the SEC staff that allowed us to form the Adviser Subsidiary as a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Separately, for information regarding our SEC exemptive relief obtained, please see the section entitled “Regulation – Exemptive Relief Obtained” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020 (the “2019 10-K”), which is incorporated by reference.
Investment Adviser Regulation
 
The Adviser Subsidiary, which is wholly owned by us, is subject to regulation under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act establishes, among other things, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on transactions between the adviser's account and an advisory client's account, limitations on transactions between the accounts of advisory clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. The Adviser Subsidiary may be examined by the SEC from time to time for compliance with the Advisers Act.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 The following discussion is a general summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to our qualification and taxation as a RIC and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our preferred stock or common stock, but does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations relating thereto. Except as otherwise noted, this discussion assumes you are a taxable U.S. person (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and that you hold your shares of our stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, assets held for investment). This discussion is based upon current provisions of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative authorities, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations by the courts or the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), possibly with retroactive effect. No attempt is made to present a detailed explanation of all U.S. federal income tax concerns affecting us and our stockholders (including stockholders subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law).
 The discussions set forth herein do not constitute tax advice. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters discussed herein. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to those set forth below. This summary does not discuss any aspects of foreign, state or local tax. Prospective investors must consult their own tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences (including the alternative minimum tax consequences) of acquiring, holding and disposing of shares of our stock, as well as the effects of state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws.
 Election to be Subject to Tax as a RIC
 Through December 31, 2005, we were subject to U.S. federal income tax as an ordinary corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. Effective beginning on January 1, 2006, we met the criteria specified below to qualify as a RIC and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for 2006. To qualify for treatment as a RIC we must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, in respect of each taxable year, dividends for federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally equal to the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). Upon satisfying these requirements in respect of a taxable year, we generally will not be subject to corporate taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders as dividends for federal income tax purposes, which will allow us to reduce our liability for corporate-level income tax.
    20
 
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
 For any taxable year in which we:
 •qualify as a RIC; and 
 •distribute dividends for federal income tax purposes to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the Annual Distribution Requirement;
 We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses) we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders with respect to that taxable year.
 We made the election to recognize built-in gains as of the effective date of our election to be treated as a RIC and therefore were not subject to built-in gains tax when we sold those assets. However, if we subsequently acquire built-in gain assets from a C corporation in a carryover basis transaction, then we may be subject to tax on the gains recognized by us on dispositions of such assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time the assets are acquired. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders.
 In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain the tax benefits of RIC status, in addition to satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement, we must, among other things:
 •have in effect at all times during each taxable year an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act;
 •derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities and (b) net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership”, or the 90% Income Test;
 •diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
 oat least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and
 ono more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of one issuer, (ii) securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships”, or the Diversification Tests.
 We may invest in partnerships which may result in our being subject to state, local, or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. In addition, some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not be qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. In order to mitigate the risk that such income and fees would disqualify us as a RIC as a result of a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations generally will be subject to corporate income taxes on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.
 As a RIC, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income and gains unless we make distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a timely manner to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the 1-year period ending October 31 of each such calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income realized, but not distributed, in preceding calendar years (“Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We are not subject to this excise tax on any amount on which we incurred U.S. federal corporate income tax (such as the tax imposed on a RIC’s retained net capital gains).
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, we may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current taxable year distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes from such taxable income into the next taxable year and incur a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution in the next taxable year under the Code is the total amount of distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent we choose to carry over taxable income into the next taxable year, distributions declared and paid by us in a taxable year may differ from
   21
 
our taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year taxable income, the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year, or returns of capital.
 Under applicable Treasury regulations and other administrative guidance issued by the IRS, we are permitted to treat certain distributions payable in our stock as taxable distributions that will satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement as well as the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement provided that stockholders have the opportunity to elect to receive the distribution in cash. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be subject to tax with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distributions, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on distributions, then such sales may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. We may in the future determine to make taxable distributions that are payable in part in our common stock.
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest provisions or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued is generally required to be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
 Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement (collectively the “Distribution Requirements”). However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Regulation—Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio”. We may be restricted from making distributions under the terms of our debt obligations themselves unless certain conditions are satisfied. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Distribution Requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio, or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Distribution Requirements, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to be subject to tax as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level income taxes.
 In addition, we will be partially dependent on our SBICs for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC Distribution Requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA’s restrictions for our SBICs to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If our SBICs are unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to be subject to tax as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level income taxes.
 Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) convert distributions that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income into ordinary income, (ii) treat distributions that would otherwise be eligible for deductions available to certain U.S. corporations under the Code as ineligible for such treatment, (iii) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (iv) convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (v) convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses, (vi) convert an ordinary loss or deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (vii) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (viii) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions, and (ix) produce gross income that will not constitute qualifying gross income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. These rules also could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders.
    22
 
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income.” If our otherwise deductible expenses in a given taxable year exceed our ordinary taxable gross income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would incur a net operating loss for that taxable year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry back or carry forward net operating losses, respectively, to prior and subsequent taxable years, and such net operating losses do not pass through to the RIC’s stockholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, realized capital losses in excess of realized capital gains) to offset the RIC’s investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such net capital losses, and generally use them to offset capital gains indefinitely. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several taxable years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such taxable income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those taxable years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions.
 Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35% or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as having been paid by its stockholders.
 If we acquire the equity securities of certain foreign corporations that earn at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of their total assets in investments producing such passive income ("PFICs"), we could be subject to federal income tax and additional interest charges on “excess distributions” received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our stockholders to the extent that such income or gain is attributable to our ownership of PFIC stock in a prior taxable year. We would not be able to pass through to our stockholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election could require us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in PFICs to minimize our liability for any such taxes and related interest charges.
 If we hold greater than 10% of the interests treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation ("CFC"), we may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each taxable year from such foreign corporation in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation’s income for such taxable year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains), whether or not the corporation makes an actual distribution during such taxable year. We would be required to include the amount of a deemed distribution from a CFC when computing our investment company taxable income as well as in determining whether we satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to RICs, even to the extent the amount of our income deemed recognized from the CFC exceeds the amount of any actual distributions from the CFC and our proceeds from any sales or other dispositions of CFC stock during a taxable year. In general, a foreign corporation will be considered a CFC if greater than 50% of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, is owned (directly, indirectly or by attribution) by U.S. Stockholders. A “U.S. Stockholder,” for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses (actually or constructively) 10% or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of a foreign corporation. Income derived by us from a CFC would generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of determining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC if the CFC makes distributions of that income to us in the same year of the CFC in which we are treated as having received a deemed distribution of such income or if the income is derived with respect to our business of investing in stocks and securities. As such, we may limit and/or manage our holdings in issuers that could be treated as CFCs in order to limit our tax liability or maximize our after-tax return from these investments.
 Our functional currency, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is the U.S. dollar. Under the Code, foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency, as well as certain non-U.S. dollar denominated debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, and similar financial instruments are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) also could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of “qualifying income” from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income.
 
   23
 
Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such taxable year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets).
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Such distributions would be taxable to our stockholders and provided certain holding period and other requirements were met, could qualify for treatment as “qualified dividend income” eligible for the 20% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate if earned by certain U.S. resident non-corporate stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction with respect to distributions current and accumulated earnings and profits if earned by certain U.S. resident corporate stockholders. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that taxable year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any taxable year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to a corporation that qualified as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one taxable year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second taxable year following the nonqualifying taxable year, we also could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five taxable years, unless we made a special election to incur a corporate-level income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
 DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
 We determine the NAV per share of our common stock quarterly. The NAV per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. As of the date of this report, we do not have any preferred stock outstanding.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 93.6% of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies whose fair value is determined in good faith by the Board. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by the Board. Our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Our debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed and institutional-backed companies in technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of our investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. As such, we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to a consistent valuation policy by our Board in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by our Board may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
We intend to continue to engage one or more independent valuation firm(s) to provide us with assistance regarding our determination of the fair value of selected portfolio investments each quarter unless directed by the Board to cancel such valuation services. Specifically, on a quarterly basis, we will identify portfolio investments with respect to which an independent valuation firm will assist in valuing. We select these portfolio investments based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the potential for material fluctuations in valuation results, credit quality and the time lapse since the last valuation of the portfolio investment by an independent valuation firm. The scope of the services rendered by an independent valuation firm is at the discretion of the Board. Our Board is ultimately, and solely, responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith.
 See “Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures.
    24
 
Determinations in Connection with Offerings
In connection with each offering of shares of our common stock, the Board or a committee thereof is required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV at the time at which the sale is made, unless it is determined by the Board that such sale is in the best interests of our stockholders. The Board considers the following factors, among others, in making such determination:
•the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC; 
 •our management’s assessment of whether any material change in the NAV has occurred (including through the realization of net gains on the sale of our portfolio investments) from the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed NAV to the period ending two days prior to the date of the sale of our common stock; and 
 •the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board or an authorized committee thereof has determined reflects the current NAV of our common stock, which is generally based upon the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management’s assessment of any material change in the NAV of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed NAV of our common stock, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering. 
 Importantly, this determination does not require that we calculate NAV in connection with each offering of shares of our common stock, but instead it involves the determination by the Board or a committee thereof that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV at the time at which the sale is made.
Moreover, to the extent that there is a possibility that we may (i) issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we will provide to the SEC in a registration statement to which a prospectus will be a part) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to a prospectus if the NAV fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances until such prospectus is amended, the Board or a committee thereof will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such, events or to undertake to determine NAV within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current NAV, and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine NAV to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered.
These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act.
 Summary Risk Factors
 The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.
Risks Related to our Business Structure
•As an internally managed BDC, we are subject to certain restrictions that may adversely affect our business. 
 •We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and we may not be able to compete effectively. 
 •Because we have substantial indebtedness, there could be increased risk in investing in our company. 
 •Regulations governing our operations as a BDC may affect our ability to, and the manner in which, we raise additional capital. 
 •Our executive officers and employees, through the Adviser Subsidiary, are expected to manage the Adviser Funds or separately managed accounts, which includes funds from External Parties, that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, which may result in significant conflicts of interest.
 •There is a risk that you may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time. 
 •We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including fluctuations in interest rates which could adversely affect our profitability or the value of our portfolio. 
 •Our operating flexibility and financial condition could be negatively affected if we fail to qualify as a BDC or RIC.
 

   25
 
Risks Related to Our Investments
•Our investments are concentrated in certain industries and in a number of technology-related companies, which subjects us to the risk of significant loss if any of these companies default on their obligations under any of their debt securities that we hold, or if any of the technology-related industry sectors experience a downturn. 
 •Our financial results could be negatively affected if a significant portfolio investment fails to perform as expected. 
 •Our investments may be in portfolio companies that have limited operating histories and resources. 
 •Our investment strategy focuses on technology-related companies, which are subject to many risks, including volatility, intense competition, shortened product life cycles, changes in regulatory and governmental programs and periodic downturns, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 •Our investments in the life sciences industry are subject to extensive government regulation, litigation risk, and certain other risks particular to that industry. 
 •Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets could adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our NAV through increased net unrealized depreciation. 
 •A lack of IPO or merger and acquisition opportunities may cause companies to stay in our portfolio longer, leading to lower returns, unrealized depreciation, or realized losses. 
 •An investment strategy focused on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel, and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. 
 •Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected if we are unable to recover our principal investment as a result of a negative pledge or lack of a security interest on the intellectual property of our venture growth stage companies. 
 •The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our investments, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price. 
 •Our warrant and equity investments can be volatile, and we may not realize gains from these investments. If our warrant and equity investments do not generate gains, then the return on our invested capital will be lower than it would otherwise be which could result in a decline in the value of shares of our common stock.
 •Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity. 
 •Our loans could be subject to equitable subordination by a court which would increase our risk of loss with respect to such loans or we could be subject to lender liability claims.
 
Risks Related to Our Securities
•Our common stock may trade below its NAV per share, which could limit our ability to raise additional equity capital. 
 •If we issue preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt securities, the NAV and market value of our common stock may become more volatile. 
 •A downgrade, suspension, or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our debt securities, if any, or change in the debt markets could cause the liquidity or market value of our debt securities to decline significantly. 
 •Our common stock price has been and continues to be volatile and may decrease substantially.
 •We may be unable to invest a significant portion of the net proceeds from an offering or from exiting an investment or other capital on acceptable terms, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 
 
General Risk Factors
 •Global macro-economic and political events, terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters or other public health emergencies may affect the market for our securities, impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 •We may be the target of litigation. 
 •Changes in laws or regulations governing our business could negatively affect the profitability of our operations. 
    Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
