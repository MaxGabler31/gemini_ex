Item 1.  Business
 Stepan Company, which was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on February 19, 1959, and its subsidiaries produce specialty and intermediate chemicals, which are sold to other manufacturers and used in a variety of end products.  The Company has three reportable segments: Surfactants, Polymers and Specialty Products.
 Revenue-Generating Products
 Surfactants are chemical agents that affect the interaction between two surfaces; they can provide actions such as detergency (i.e., the ability of water to remove soil from another surface), wetting and foaming, dispersing, emulsification (aiding two dissimilar liquids to mix), demulsification, viscosity modifications and biocidal disinfectants. Surfactants are the basic cleaning agent in detergents for washing clothes, dishes, carpets, fine fabrics, floors and walls.  Surfactants are also used for the same purpose in shampoos, body wash and conditioners, fabric softeners, toothpastes, cosmetics and other personal care products.  Commercial and industrial applications include emulsifiers for agricultural products, emulsion polymers such as floor polishes and latex foams and coatings, wetting and foaming agents for wallboard manufacturing and surfactants for oilfield applications.
 Polymers, which include polyurethane polyols, polyester resins and phthalic anhydride, are used in a variety of applications.  Polyurethane polyols are used in the manufacture of rigid foam for thermal insulation in the construction industry.  They are also a raw material base for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE) applications.  Polyester resins, which include liquid and powdered products, are used in CASE applications. Phthalic anhydride is used in polyester resins, alkyd resins, and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive, boating, and other consumer products and internally in the production of polyols.
 Specialty Products are chemicals used in food, flavoring, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical applications.
 Competitive Conditions
 The Company does not sell directly to the retail market but sells to a wide range of manufacturers in many industries and has many competitors.  The principal methods of competition are product performance, price, technical assistance and ability to meet the specific needs of individual customers.  These factors allow the Company to compete on bases other than price alone, reducing the severity of competition compared to that experienced in the sales of commodity chemicals having identical performance characteristics.  The Company is one of the leading merchant producers of surfactants in the world.  In the case of surfactants, much of the Company’s competition comes from several large global and regional producers and the internal divisions of larger customers.  In the manufacture of polymers, the Company competes with the chemical divisions of several large companies, as well as with other small specialty chemical manufacturers.  In specialty products, the Company competes with several large firms plus numerous small companies.
Material Resources
 Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing plants operate on electricity and interruptible natural gas. During peak heating demand periods, gas service to all plants may be temporarily interrupted for varying periods ranging from a few days to several months.  The plants operate on fuel oil during these periods of interruption. In January 2020 and January 2022, the Company’s Millsdale, Illinois facility suffered power outages that caused temporary shutdowns and further related operational issues. The Company’s operations have not experienced any other plant shutdowns or adverse effects upon its business in recent years that were caused by a lack of available energy sources, other than temporary service interruptions brought on by mechanical failure or severe weather conditions.
 The principal raw materials used by the Company are petroleum or plant based. For 2022, the Company has contracts with suppliers that cover most of its forecasted requirements for major raw materials and is not substantially dependent upon any one supplier.
 Compliance with Government Regulations
 Compliance with applicable country, state and local regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, resulted in capital expenditures by the Company of $13.4 million during 2021.  These expenditures represented approximately seven percent of the Company’s total 2021 capital expenditures. Capitalized environmental expenditures are depreciated and charged on a straight-line basis to pretax earnings over their estimated useful lives, which are typically 10 to 15 years. Recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and waste disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately 
 3

$34.9 million in 2021. Compliance with such regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings and competitive position in the foreseeable future.
 Human Capital Resources
 At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company employed 2,439 and 2,293 persons, respectively. We view our employees as critical to helping us realize our vision of delivering innovative chemical solutions for a cleaner, healthier, more energy efficient world. The Company’s five Values reflect our shared commitment to this vision and serve as a guide as we operate our business: (1) People First: Empowering Everyone to Make a Difference – we listen, share and recognize great work; (2) Integrity: Doing the Right Thing – we do what is right and safe, and can be counted upon to fulfill our commitments and speak up when we have concerns; (3) Customer Focused: Partnering to Deliver Value – our approach to collaborative chemistry helps our customers’ products perform and deliver solutions that serve the needs of our global community; (4) Continuous Improvement: Improving Every Day – we embrace a spirit of continuous learning to improve the sustainability of our practices and our products; and (5) Growth, Innovation and Sustainability: Shaping the Future Through Curiosity – we see incredible possibilities and accept the challenge to make a positive impact.
 Safety for all employees, our business partners, and the communities in which we operate continues to be a top priority. We have a long-standing focus on safety and responsible chemicals management, as well as a commitment to the environmental, health, safety and security performance initiative of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a U.S.-based chemical industry association. As part of this focus and commitment, the Company invests in behavior based and risk-based safety programs for its global workforce. The goal of these programs is to help establish habits and behaviors that promote safety awareness, thinking, and responsiveness. All Company facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified, and the Company conforms to the ACC Responsible Care Management System at its U.S. sites. In addition, facilities outside the United States are encouraged to participate in their country-specific Responsible Care® program equivalents. Special recognition is given annually to the Company’s facilities that have demonstrated safety achievements. The President’s Safety Award is given to sites that meet specific criteria for recordable incidents and injuries, as well as other safety and compliance requirements, over the course of the year. 
 We depend on our highly skilled workforce to reach our business goals, and through a robust commitment to promote safety and well-being, enable professional development, and provide excellent benefits, the Company aims to attract and retain top talent.  We value the fact that we have a diverse, inclusive, and engaged community of workers, and our goal, is to create workplace environments built on respect, safety, strong teamwork, and high competency.  Employee feedback is regularly solicited on workplace practices and culture.  Results from these surveys are used at the corporate and site levels to define needs and develop improvement plans.  Across our operations, employees are encouraged and supported in developing the technical and leadership skills they need to excel at their work and to advance in their roles.  The Company provides an array of opportunities, including our Emerging Leaders Program, Leadership Development Program, technical training and certifications, language training, and educational assistance.  Developing our talent pipeline and retaining our skilled labor force is a key focus, and our objective is to support employees’ progress toward their professional goals through opportunities within the Company.  Employees receive comprehensive and competitive benefits packages aimed at attracting top talent and supporting needs for work-life balance.  Employees are rewarded for their positive contributions to company success with Pay-for-Performance incentives.
