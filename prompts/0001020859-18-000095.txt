ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless otherwise specified, references to "United Natural Foods," "UNFI," "we," "us," "our" or "the Company" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report" or "Report") mean United Natural Foods, Inc. and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. See the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report for information regarding our financial performance.
Overview
We are a Delaware corporation based in Providence, Rhode Island, and we conduct business through our various wholly owned subsidiaries. We are a leading distributor based on sales of natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products in the United States and Canada. We believe that our thirty-three distribution centers, representing approximately 8.8 million square feet of warehouse space, provide us with the largest capacity of any North American-based distributor principally focused on the natural, organic and specialty products industry. The Company has two principal operating divisions: the wholesale division which is comprised of several business units aggregated under the wholesale segment, which is the Company's only reportable segment; and the manufacturing and branded products division. 
Since the formation of our predecessor in 1976, we have grown our business both organically and through acquisitions which have expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. 
Acquisitions
In July 2014, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Tony's Fine Foods ("Tony's"), through our wholly-owned subsidiary UNFI West, Inc. ("UNFI West"). With the completion of the transaction, Tony's became a wholly-owned subsidiary and continues to operate as Tony's Fine Foods. Tony's is headquartered in West Sacramento, California and is a leading distributor of perishable food products, including a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, food service and bakery goods to retail and specialty grocers, food service customers and other distribution companies principally located throughout the Western United States, as well as Alaska and Hawaii. 
During fiscal 2015, we began shipping customers both center of the store products and an enhanced selection of fresh, perishable products typically located in the perimeter of the store. Our customers utilized both UNFI’s broadline and Tony's perishable offerings, including grocery, refrigerated, protein, specialty cheese and prepared foods. Our customers seek a full spectrum of offerings and we believe that there is significant value in UNFI's position as a leading provider of logistics, distribution and category management for both center store and perimeter products.
In March 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Global Organic/Specialty Source, Inc. and related affiliates (collectively "Global Organic") through our wholly owned subsidiary Albert's Organics, Inc. ("Albert's"), in a cash transaction for approximately $20.6 million. Global Organic is a distributor of organic fruits, vegetables, juices, milk, eggs, nuts, and coffee located in Sarasota, Florida serving customer locations across the Southeastern United States. Global Organic's operations have been fully integrated into the existing Albert's business in the Southeastern United States. 
In March 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Nor-Cal Produce, Inc. ("Nor-Cal") and an affiliated entity as well as certain real estate, in a cash transaction for approximately $67.8 million. Nor-Cal is a distributor of conventional and organic produce and other fresh products primarily to independent retailers in Northern California, with primary operations located in West Sacramento, California. Our acquisition of Nor-Cal has aided in our efforts to expand our fresh offering, particularly with conventional produce. Nor-Cal's operations have been combined with the existing Albert's business. 
In May 2016, the Company acquired all outstanding equity securities of Haddon House Food Products Inc. ("Haddon") and certain affiliated entities and real estate for total cash consideration of approximately $217.5 million. Haddon is a distributor and merchandiser of natural and organic and gourmet ethnic products throughout the Eastern United States. Haddon has a diverse, multi-channel customer base including supermarkets, gourmet food stores and independent retailers. Our acquisition of Haddon has expanded our gourmet and ethnic product and service offering which we expect to play an important role in our ongoing strategy to build out these product categories. Haddon's operations have been combined with the Company's existing broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States. 
In August 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Gourmet Guru Inc. ("Gourmet Guru") in a cash transaction for approximately $10.0 million. Gourmet Guru is a distributor and merchandiser of fresh and organic food focusing on new and emerging brands. We believe that our acquisition of Gourmet Guru enhances our strength in finding and cultivating 
1

emerging fresh and organic brands and further expands our presence in key urban markets. Gourmet Guru's operations have been combined with the Company's existing broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States. 
The ability to distribute specialty food items (including ethnic, kosher and gourmet products) has accelerated our expansion into a number of high-growth business markets and allowed us to establish immediate market share in the fast-growing specialty foods market. We have now integrated specialty food products and natural and organic specialty non-food items into all of our broadline distribution centers across the United States and Canada. Due to our expansion into specialty foods, over the past several fiscal years we have been awarded new business with a number of supermarkets. We believe our acquisition of Haddon has expanded our capabilities in the specialty category and we have expanded our offerings of specialty products to include those products distributed by Haddon that we did not previously distribute to our customers. We believe that the distribution of these products enhanced our supermarket business channel and that our complementary product lines continue to present opportunities for cross-selling.
On July 25, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of SUPERVALU INC. (“SUPERVALU”) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (the "Merger"), including the assumption of outstanding debt and liabilities. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to antitrust approvals, SUPERVALU shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2018. The proposed acquisition of SUPERVALU is expected to expand the Company’s customer base and exposure across channels, add high-growth perimeter categories such as meat and produce to the Company’s natural and organic products, provide the Company a wider geographic reach and greater scale, and increase efficiencies.
Our Operating Structure
Our operations are generally comprised of two principal operating divisions. These operating divisions are:

• | our wholesale division, which includes:


◦ | our broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States;


◦ | Tony's, which distributes a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, foodservice and bakery goods, principally throughout the Western United States;


◦ | Albert's, which distributes organically grown produce and non-produce perishable items within the United States, and includes the operations of Nor-Cal, a distributor of organic and conventional produce and non-produce perishable items principally in Northern California;


◦ | UNFI Canada, Inc. ("UNFI Canada"), which is our natural, organic and specialty distribution business in Canada; and


◦ | Select Nutrition, which distributes vitamins, minerals and supplements; and


• | our manufacturing and branded products division, consisting of:


◦ | Woodstock Farms Manufacturing, which specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and the distribution of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections; and


◦ | our Blue Marble Brands branded product lines.

We disposed of our retail business, Earth Origins Market ("Earth Origins"), during fiscal 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Select Nutrition business will be combined with our broadline operations. 
Wholesale Division
In August 2016, we launched an initiative to reorganize our sales structure in the United States. This new structure is regional and our broadline distribution business is now organized into three sales regions— our Atlantic Region, Central Region and Pacific Region. Each region has a president responsible for all our products and services within the territory, including fresh, grocery, wellness, e-commerce, food services, and ethnic gourmet. Territory managers in these regions now sell across our complete lines of products. This change brings us to our customers more frequently with all of our service offerings and we anticipate identifying and taking advantage of sales opportunities that result from our customers having a single point of contact for all of our products and services. 
As of our 2018 fiscal year end, our Atlantic Region operated ten distribution centers, our Central Region operated six distribution centers, and our Pacific Region operated twelve distribution centers. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company realigned two of its distributions centers previously included in the Atlantic Region to the Pacific Region. 
Certain of our distribution centers are shared by multiple operations within our wholesale division.
2

Tony's operates out of four distribution centers located in California and Washington. In addition to the four Tony's facilities, the Company distributes Tony's perishable products from certain of its other broadline distribution centers, including our Aurora, Colorado facility. 
Albert's operates out of four distribution centers located throughout the United States.
UNFI Canada distributes natural, organic and specialty products in all of our product categories to all of our customers in Canada. As of our 2018 fiscal year end, UNFI Canada operated four distribution centers.
Through Select Nutrition, we distribute more than 14,000 health and beauty aids, vitamins, minerals and supplements from distribution centers in Pennsylvania and California.
Manufacturing and Branded Products Division
Our subsidiary doing business as Woodstock Farms Manufacturing specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and the distribution of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections for our customers and in the Company's branded products. Woodstock Farms Manufacturing sells items manufactured in bulk and through private label packaging arrangements with large health food, supermarket and convenience store chains and independent retailers. 
We operate an organic (United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and Quality Assurance International ("QAI")) and kosher (Circle K) certified packaging, roasting, and processing facility in New Jersey that is SQF (Safety Quality Food) level 2 certified.
Our Blue Marble Brands portfolio is a collection of 17 organic, non-GMO, clean and specialty food brands representing more than 750 unique retail and food service products sourced from over 30 countries around the globe. Blue Marble Brands defines clean ingredients to be minimally processed foods, using only essential ingredients that contain no artificial colors or flavors. Our Blue Marble Brands products are sold through our wholesale division, third-party distributors and directly to retailers. Our Field Day® brand is primarily sold to customers in our independent channel and is meant to serve as a private label brand for retailers to allow them to compete with supermarket and supernatural chains which often have their own private label store brands.
To maintain our market position and improve our operating efficiencies, we seek to continually:

• | expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions;


• | expand our national purchasing opportunities;


• | offer a broader product selection than our competitors;


• | offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on-time deliveries than our competitors;


• | centralize general and administrative functions to reduce expenses;


• | consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions;


• | increase our investment in people, facilities, equipment and technology;


• | integrate administrative and accounting functions; and


• | reduce the geographic overlap between regions.

Our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities in an effort to achieve increasing operating efficiencies. 
Our Customers
We serve more than 40,000 customer locations primarily located across the United States and Canada which we classify into four channels:

• | supernatural, which consists of chain accounts that are national in scope and carry greater than 90% natural products, and at this time currently consists solely of Whole Foods Market;


• | supermarkets, which include accounts that also carry conventional products, and at this time currently include chain accounts, supermarket independents, and gourmet and ethnic specialty stores;


• | independents, which include single store and chain accounts (excluding supernatural, as defined above), which carry more than 90% natural products and buying clubs of consumer groups joined to buy products; and


• | other, which includes foodservice, e-commerce and international customers outside of Canada, as well as sales to Amazon.com, Inc.

We maintain long-standing customer relationships with customers in our supernatural, supermarket and independent channels. 
The following were included among our wholesale customers for fiscal 2018:
3


• | Whole Foods Market, the largest supernatural chain in the United States and Canada; and


• | Other customers, including Natural Grocers, Wegmans, Kroger, Earth Fare, Sprouts Farmers Market, Giant-Carlisle, Stop & Shop, Giant-Landover, Giant Eagle, Hannaford, Harris Teeter, The Fresh Market, Market Basket, Shop-Rite, Publix, Raley's, Lucky's, and Loblaws.

We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2018, and accounted for approximately 37% of our net sales. 
During fiscal 2017, our net sales by channel were adjusted to reflect changes in the classification of customer types from acquisitions we consummated in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017. There was no financial statement impact as a result of revising the classification of customer types. The following table lists the percentage of net sales by customer type for the fiscal years ended July 28, 2018, July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016:

 | Percentage of Net Sales
Customer Type | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Supernatural | 37 | % | | 33 | % | 35 | %
Supermarkets | 28 | % | | 30 | % | 27 | %
Independents | 25 | % | | 26 | % | 27 | %
Other | 10 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %

We distribute natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products to customers located in the United States and Canada, as well as to customers located in other foreign countries. Our total international net sales, including those by UNFI Canada, represented approximately three percent of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and four percent in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. We believe that our sales outside the United States will expand as we seek to continue to grow our Canadian operations and our foodservice and e-commerce businesses, both of which include customers based outside of the United States.
Our Marketing Services
We offer a variety of marketing services designed to increase sales for our customers and suppliers, including consumer and trade marketing programs, as well as programs to support suppliers in understanding our markets. Trade and consumer marketing programs are supplier-sponsored programs that cater to a broad range of retail formats. These programs are designed to educate consumers, profile suppliers and increase sales for retailers, many of which do not have the resources necessary to conduct such marketing programs independently.
Consumer Marketing Programs

• | Monthly, region-specific, consumer circular programs, with the participating retailers’ imprint featuring products sold by the retailer to its customers. The monthly circular programs are structured to pass through the benefit of our negotiated discounts and advertising allowances to the retailer, and also provide retailers with a physical flyer and shelf tags corresponding to each month's promotions. We also offer a web-based tool which retailers can use to produce highly customized circulars and other marketing materials for their stores called the Customized Marketing Program.


• | Truck advertising program that allows our suppliers to purchase advertising space on the sides of our hundreds of trailers traveling throughout the United States and Canada, increasing brand exposure to consumers.

Trade Marketing Programs

• | New item introduction programs showcase a supplier's new items to retailers through trial and discounts.


• | Customer Portal Advertising that allows our suppliers to advertise directly to retailers using the portal that many retailers use to order product and/or gather product information.


• | Foodservice options designed to support accounts in that category.


• | Monthly Specials Catalogs that highlight promotions and new product introductions.


• | Specialized catalogs for holiday and seasonal products.

Supplier Marketing Programs

• | ClearVue®, an information sharing program offered to a select group of suppliers designed to improve the transparency of information and drive efficiency within the supply chain. With the availability of in-depth data and tailored reporting tools, participants are able to reduce inventory balances while improving service levels.

4


• | Supply Chain by ClearVue®, an information sharing program designed to provide heightened transparency to suppliers through demand planning, forecasting and procurement insights. This program offers weekly and monthly reporting enabling suppliers to identify areas of sales growth while pinpointing specific opportunities for achieving greater profits.


• | Supplier-In-Site (SIS), an information-sharing website that helps our suppliers better understand the independents channel in order to generate mutually beneficial incremental sales in an efficient manner.


• | Growth incentive programs, supplier-focused high-level sales and marketing support for selected brands, which foster our partnership by building incremental, mutually profitable sales for suppliers and us.

Periodically, we conduct focus group sessions with certain key retailers and suppliers to ascertain their needs and allow us to better service them. We also provide our customers with:

• | trends reports in the natural and organic industry;


• | product data information such as best seller lists, store usage reports and catalogs;


• | assistance with store layout designs; new store design and equipment procurement;


• | planogramming, shelf and category management support;


• | in-store signage and promotional materials assistance with planning and setting up product displays;


• | shelf tags for products; and


• | a robust customer portal with product information, search and ordering capabilities, reports and publications.

Our Products
Our extensive selection of natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products enables us to provide a primary source of supply to a diverse base of customers whose product needs vary significantly. We offer more than 110,000 natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products, consisting of national, regional and private label brands grouped into six product categories: grocery and general merchandise, produce, perishables and frozen foods, nutritional supplements and sports nutrition, bulk and foodservice products and personal care items. Our branded product lines address certain needs of our customers, including providing a lower-cost label known as Field Day®.
We maintain a comprehensive quality assurance program. All of the products we sell that are represented as "organic" are required to be certified as such by an independent third-party agency. We maintain current certification affidavits on most organic commodities and produce in order to verify the authenticity of the product. Most potential suppliers of organic products are required to provide such third-party certifications to us before they are approved as suppliers.
Organic Certification
Our “Certified Organic Distributor” certification covers all of our broadline distribution centers in the United States, except for facilities acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Tony’s, Haddon, and Nor-Cal. Although not designated as a “Certified Organic Distributor” by QAI, the three Tony’s California locations are certified as Organic by the State of California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch, and Nor-Cal is currently registered with the California Department of Food and Agriculture Organic Program as an organic handler. In addition, our Canadian distribution centers in British Columbia and Ontario both hold one of the following organic distributor certifications: QAI, EcoCert Canada or ProCert Canada. 
Working Capital
Normal operating fluctuations in working capital balances can result in changes to cash flow from operations presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows that are not necessarily indicative of long-term operating trends. Our working capital needs are generally greater during the months leading up to high sales periods, such as the build up in inventory during the time period leading to the calendar year-end holidays. We typically finance these working capital needs with funds provided by operating activities and available credit through our amended and restated revolving credit facility (the “Existing ABL Facility”) pursuant to our Third Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2016, by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other borrowers, agents and lenders party thereto (the “Existing ABL Loan Agreement”).
Our Suppliers
We purchase our products from more than 9,000 suppliers. The majority of our suppliers are based in the United States and Canada, but we also source products from suppliers throughout Europe, Asia, Central America, South America, Africa and Australia. We believe suppliers of natural and organic products seek to distribute their products through us because we provide access to a large customer base across the United States and Canada, distribute the majority of the suppliers' products and offer a wide variety of marketing programs to our customers to help sell the suppliers' products. Substantially all product categories that we distribute are available from a number of suppliers and, therefore, we are not dependent on any single source of supply for any product 
5

category. In addition, although we have exclusive distribution arrangements and support programs with several suppliers, none of our suppliers account for more than 5% of our total purchases in fiscal 2018. 
We have positioned ourselves as one of the largest purchasers of organically grown bulk products in the natural and organic products industry by centralizing our purchase of nuts, seeds, grains, flours and dried foods. As a result, we are able to negotiate purchases from suppliers on the basis of volume and other considerations that may include discounted pricing or prompt payment discounts. Furthermore, some of our purchase arrangements include the right of return to the supplier with respect to products that we do not sell in a certain period of time. Each region is responsible for placing its own orders and can select the products that it believes will most appeal to its customers, although each region is able to participate in our company-wide purchasing programs. Our outstanding commitments for the purchase of inventory were approximately $15.9 million as of July 28, 2018.
Our Distribution System
The sites for our distribution centers are chosen to provide direct access to our regional markets. This proximity allows us to reduce our transportation costs relative to those of our competitors that seek to service these customers from locations that are often several hundred miles away. We believe that we incur lower inbound freight expense than our regional competitors because our scale allows us to buy full and partial truckloads of products. Products are delivered to our distribution centers primarily by our fleet of leased trucks, contract carriers and the suppliers themselves. When financially advantageous, we pick up product from suppliers or satellite staging facilities and return it to our distribution centers using our own trucks. Additionally, we generally can redistribute overstocks and inventory imbalances between our distribution centers if needed, which helps to reduce out of stocks and to sell perishable products prior to their expiration date.
The majority of our trucks are leased from a variety of national banks and are maintained by third party national leasing companies such as Ryder Truck Leasing and Penske Truck Leasing, which in some cases maintain facilities on our premises for the maintenance and service of these vehicles as well as facilities where we run our own maintenance shops. 
We ship certain orders for supplements or for items that are destined for areas outside of regular delivery routes through United States Postal Service, the United Parcel Service and other independent carriers. Deliveries to areas outside the continental United States and Canada are typically shipped by ocean-going containers on a weekly basis.
Our Focus on Technology
We have made significant investments in distribution, financial, information and warehouse management systems. We continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems at our regional operations in an effort to make the systems more efficient, cost-effective and responsive to customer needs. These systems include functionality in radio frequency inventory control, pick-to-voice systems, pick-to-light systems, computer-assisted order processing and slot locater/retrieval assignment systems. At most of our receiving docks, warehouse associates attach computer-generated, preprinted locater tags to inbound products. These tags contain the expiration date, locations, quantity, lot number and other information about the products in bar code format. Customer returns are processed by scanning the UPC bar codes. We also employ a management information system that enables us to lower our inbound transportation costs by making optimum use of our own fleet of trucks or by consolidating deliveries into full truckloads. Orders from multiple suppliers and multiple distribution centers are consolidated into single truckloads for efficient use of available vehicle capacity. In addition, we utilize route efficiency software that assists us in developing the most efficient routes for our outbound trucks. As part of our “one company” approach, we are in the process of rolling out a national warehouse management and procurement system to convert our existing facilities into a single warehouse management and supply chain platform ("WMS"). WMS supports our effort to integrate and nationalize processes across the organization and we have successfully implemented the WMS system at fifteen of our facilities. In light of the proposed acquisition of SUPERVALU, we are reevaluating our warehouse management system strategy. However, we continue to be focused on the automation of our new or expanded distribution centers that are at different stages of construction.
Intellectual Property
We do not own or have the right to use any patent, trademark, trade name, license, franchise, or concession, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Competition
Our largest competition comes from direct distribution, whereby a customer reaches a product volume level that justifies distribution directly from the manufacturer in order to obtain a lower price. Our major wholesale distribution competitor in both the United States and Canada is KeHE Distributors, LLC ("Kehe"). In addition to its natural and organic products, Kehe distributes specialty food products and markets its own private label program. We also compete in the United States and Canada with numerous smaller regional and local distributors of natural, organic, ethnic, kosher, gourmet and other specialty foods that focus on niche or regional markets, and with national, regional and local distributors of conventional groceries who have significantly expanded their natural 
6

and organic product offerings in recent years and companies that distribute to their own retail facilities. Our customers also compete with online retailers and distributors of natural and organic products that seek to sell products directly to customers.
We believe that distributors in the natural and specialty products industries primarily compete on distribution service levels, product quality, depth of inventory selection, price and quality of customer service. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
Government Regulation
Our operations and many of the products that we distribute in the United States are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation. In the United States, our facilities generally are inspected at least once annually by state or federal authorities. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the USDA to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program.
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), represents a significant expansion of food safety requirements and FDA food safety authorities and, among other things, requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices, and other tasks. 
The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United States Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.
Many of our facilities in the U.S. and in Canada are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater.  Further, many of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel, hydrogen fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks.  Moreover, in some of our facilities we, or third parties with whom we contract, perform vehicle maintenance. Our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental and safety legal requirements.  We are subject to other federal, state, provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials; however, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities.
Employees
As of July 28, 2018, we had approximately 10,000 full and part-time employees, 725 of whom (approximately 7.3%) are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The following are the facilities which have collective bargaining agreements and the respective expiration dates of those agreements: Moreno Valley, California (March 2019), Edison, New Jersey (March 2019), Dayville, Connecticut (July 2019), West Sacramento, California (May 2020), Hudson Valley, New York (July 2020), Auburn, Washington (February 2021), Iowa City, Iowa (July 2021) and Concord, Ontario (March 2022). We have in the past been the focus of union-organizing efforts, and we believe it is likely that we will be the focus of similar efforts in the future.
In January 2018, the National Labor Relations Board certified the election results of our driver employees in Gilroy, California to be represented by the Teamsters union. We are in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with these employees.
Seasonality
Generally, we do not experience any material seasonality. However, our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses, management's ability to execute our operating and growth strategies, personnel changes, demand for our products, supply shortages and general economic conditions.
