MARKET DEFINITION 
 
Industry Description and Outlook 
 
There are over 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. with over 750,000 police officers. The law enforcement market is scattered across the country and is typically serviced by distributors.
 
Across the United States and Western Europe, municipalities are increasingly providing body armor to first responders, such as firefighters and EMS professionals. This trend has been driven by an increased need for first responders to be able to provide emergency relief during terrorist attacks, active shooter events, or other situations where they may encounter gunfire. With an estimated 1.13 million firefighters and 891,000 EMS professionals in the United States alone, this trend represents a significant expansion of the domestic body armor market.
 
Body armor has a life cycle of five years. This, combined with an average 10% attrition rate in law enforcement, means that approximately 30% of body armor purchases turn over every year.

In addition to an expanding domestic market, according to the latest research on the body armor market conducted by Grand View Research, the global body armor market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 to 2025. The Company continues to focus on taking advantage of this global trend by marketing the HighCom product line internationally, particularly in Canada, Mexico and the Middle East and North Africa .
 
HighCom Compliance 
 
HighCom has an in-depth ethics and compliance management and monitoring program that is tied to our International Standard Organization (“ISO”) certified quality processes.

The Company has also conducted internal and external training with regards to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other foreign business regulations that help our employees recognize and avoid red flags and potential risk situations.
 
The Company makes compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of the Treasury and all other governmental agencies’ regulations a top priority. The Company is also registered through the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls as well as the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) to maintain control over the export management and compliance.

Competition 
 
HighCom operates in a highly competitive market. This intense competition creates the potential for pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and difficulty growing market share. HighCom’s focus is on producing the highest quality ballistic plates at a price point competitive with foreign and domestic alternatives. Some of HighCom’s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources and, in certain cases, may have lower cost structures, potentially affording them competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of products, to negotiate lower prices on raw materials and components, to deliver competitive products at lower prices, and to introduce new products and respond to customer requirements more effectively and quickly than HighCom.
