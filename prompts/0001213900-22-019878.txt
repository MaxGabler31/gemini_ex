Item 1. Business.
Introduction



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Initial Business Combination”). Our sponsor is Inflection Point Holdings LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the “Sponsor”).



Our business strategy is to identify and complete our Initial Business Combination with a company that complements the experiences and skills of our leadership team and can benefit from their operational expertise. Our selection process will leverage our leadership team’s broad and deep relationship network, unique industry experiences and proven deal sourcing capabilities to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. This network has been developed through our leadership team’s extensive experience and demonstrated success both investing in and operating businesses in our target sectors and across a variety of industries.



Over the course of our leadership’s careers, they have developed experience in:




● | Operating world-class global consumer brands in highly competitive consumer categories;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scaling established brands across their next stage of growth and further creating new brand categories and independent sub-brands to expand addressable markets and deepen customer relationships;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Working with emerging consumer brands on strategy and operational execution to create category-killer products and drive recurring relationships with customers across a variety of categories;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Sourcing, researching and investing in numerous special situation and corporate transformation opportunities with a multi-year hold period enabled by deep sector knowledge and close management relationships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that our leadership team is well positioned to identify attractive Initial Business Combination opportunities with a compelling industry backdrop and an opportunity for transformational growth. Our objectives are to generate attractive returns for shareholders and enhance value through improving operational performance of the acquired company. We expect to favor opportunities with certain industry and business characteristics. Key industry characteristics include stable long-term growth trends and industry fundamentals, attractive competitive dynamics, opportunities to benefit from secular changes in consumer behavior (including shifting consumer demographics, changing consumer shopping behaviors and evolving consumer preferences), limited “fad” or technological disruption risks and potential consolidation opportunities. Key business characteristics include high year over year expansion, attractive market positions and competitive advantages, strong operating margins and free cash flow characteristics, opportunities for operational improvement and scalable business models.



We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an Initial Business Combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete an Initial Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.

The registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”) was declared effective on September 21, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On September 24, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $300,000,000.The underwriters had a 45-day option from the Effective Date to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On October 29, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option (the “Over-Allotment” and together with the IPO, the “Public Offering”) and purchased an additional 2,975,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) generating additional gross proceeds of $29,750,000, and forfeited their option to purchase the remaining 1,525,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Ordinary Shares” or “Public Shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”).



Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 6,250,000 warrants (the “IPO Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per IPO Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,250,000. On October 29, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor purchased an additional 595,000 warrants (the “Over-Allotment Private Placement Warrants” and together with the IPO Private Placement Warrants, the “Private Placement Warrants” and the Private Placement Warrants together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”), generating aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $595,000.



On February 3, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain offering and formation costs in consideration for 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 (the “Founder Shares”). On March 5, 2021, the Company effected a 1.2 to 1 share recapitalization with respect to its Class B ordinary shares, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares. Up to 1,125,000 Founder Shares were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised. On October 29, 2021, as a result of the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 381,250 Founder Shares and the remaining Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.



An aggregate of 12 qualified institutional buyers (“Anchor Investors”) expressed an interest to purchase an aggregate of approximately $322.3 million of the Units sold in the IPO. None of the Anchor Investors expressed an interest in purchasing more than 9.9% of the Units sold in the IPO. The Anchor Investors were allocated and purchased a total of 29,540,000 Units or 98.5% of the Units sold in the IPO. One of the Anchor Investors, Kingstown 1740 Fund, LP, is an affiliate of the Sponsor, and was allocated and purchased 2,900,000 Units sold in the IPO. In addition, subject to each Anchor Investor purchasing 100% of the Units allocated to it, in connection with the closing of the IPO, the Sponsor sold membership interests reflecting an allocation of Founder Shares to each Anchor Investor, representing an aggregate of 1,625,000 Founder Shares to all Anchor Investors.



Following the closing of the IPO on September 24, 2021, $300,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the IPO Private Placement Warrants was deposited into a trust account (the “Trust Account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Following the closing of the Over-Allotment on October 29, 2021, an additional $29,750,000 ($10.00 per Over-Allotment Unit) from the net proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units in the Over-Allotment and the sale of the Over-Allotment Private Placement Units was deposited into the Trust Account.



The funds held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account.



As of December 31, 2021, there was $329,755,798 in cash and securities held in the Trust Account, which includes interest income of $5,798. As of December 31, 2021, $359,610 of cash is held outside the Trust Account, available for working capital needs. The Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash held in the Trust Account, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



While we may pursue an Initial Business Combination target in any industry, we intend to focus our search initially on North American and European businesses in the consumer and technology sectors, which complements the expertise of our management team. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended on September 21, 2021, our “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”) prohibits us from entering into an Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our board of directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.



We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Initial Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination.





3







If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, clinical, scientific, IP, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Initial Business Combination transaction.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Initial Business Combination. Except as described herein, the Company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Initial Business Combination.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or from completing the Initial Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an Initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated (as defined in our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association) with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions stating that the consideration to be paid by us in such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



We will provide the holders of our Public Shares (our “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the Trust Account at such time is anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per Public Share. The per share amount we will distribute to Public Shareholders who properly redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination.



Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote



In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination.





4







If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. A quorum for such meeting will be present if the holders of a majority of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are represented in person or by proxy. Our Sponsor, officers and directors will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of the Initial Business Combination.



If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of Public Shares our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited under the Exchange Act.



We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.



The purpose of any such purchases of Public Shares could be to vote such Public Shares in favor of the Initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such Public Warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Public Shares or Public Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules



If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Shareholders not tendering more than the number of Public Shares we are permitted to redeem. If Public Shareholders tender more Public Shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination.



Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval



If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that a Public Shareholders, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person with whom such Public hareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares without our prior consent (the “Excess Shares”). We believe this restriction will discourage Public Shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their Public Shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s Public Shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our Public Shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Public Shares without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of Public Shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our Public Shareholders’ ability to vote all of their Public Shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that we have 24 months from the closing of our IPO, i.e., September 24, 2023, (“Completion Window”) to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses; (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the Completion Window.
Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess similar or greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our Public Shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our issued and outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.
Employees



We currently have three officers: Michael Blitzer, Guy Shanon and Brian Pitz. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. We have only one full time employee, Kevin Shannon.
