Item 1. Business
Overview and History 
ASGN Incorporated ("ASGN," "we," or "us") is a leading provider of information technology (IT) services and professional solutions, including technology, creative, and digital, across the commercial and government sectors. We operate through two segments, Commercial and Federal Government. Our Commercial Segment, which is our largest segment, provides consulting, creative digital marketing and permanent placement services primarily to Fortune 1000 clients and mid-market companies. Our Federal Government Segment provides mission-critical solutions to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies and civilian agencies. 
We have grown through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Over the last four years, we acquired ECS Federal, LLC ("ECS") in April 2018 and nine "tuck-in" acquisitions that align with our strategy to expand our IT consulting services and solutions capabilities in the commercial and federal government markets.
On August 17, 2021, we sold the Oxford Global Resources business unit (the "Oxford business"), see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 4. Discontinued Operations. As a result of this disposition, the Oxford business has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein and all segment data has been recast to remove Oxford as reportable segment.

ASGN was incorporated in 1992. Our principal office is located at 4400 Cox Road, Suite 110, Glen Allen, Virginia 23060, and our telephone number is (888) 482-8068. 

Commercial Segment
Our Commercial Segment (73.0 percent of consolidated revenues) provides a broad spectrum of IT services and solutions and creative digital marketing services primarily to Fortune 1000 and mid-market clients through a network of 95 branch offices across the United States, five branch offices in Canada and Europe, and two delivery centers in Mexico and India. Growth in this segment is being driven across industries by durable digital transformation and innovation requirements, workforce mobilization and modern enterprise needs. Our talent pool can be deployed in short duration solution-specific engagements or long-term consultative roles.
Corporate support activities are based in Richmond, Virginia, Los Angeles, California and Irvine, California.
Assignment — We provide our clients with experienced IT and creative digital marketing contract professionals for temporary assignments and project engagements. Our contract professionals have knowledge and experience in specialized technical and creative digital marketing services that make them qualified to fill a given assignment or project. 
Consulting — We provide workforce mobilization, modern enterprise and digital innovation IT consulting services. Our contract professionals and subject matter experts deliver solutions that are customer focused and value driven. From requirements definition to full managed services, we provide a continuum of cloud, data and analytics, and digital transformation solutions to support our clients’ modern enterprise and digital needs, across the full life cycle. 
Federal Government Segment
Our Federal Government Segment (27.0 percent of consolidated revenues) delivers advanced solutions in cloud, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, application and IT modernization, science and engineering to some of the world's leading agencies in both the public and private sectors. Our team of skilled experts tackle critical and highly complex challenges for customers in the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, federal civilian agencies and state and local government, education and commercial customers. We maintain premier relationships with leading cloud, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence/machine learning providers and hold specialized certifications in these technologies. 
The segment provides services under time-and-materials, cost reimbursable and firm-fixed-price contracts. Contracts range from approximately three to five years in length. We have a backlog of awarded contracts of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, which represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under awarded contracts including task orders and options. 
Corporate support activities are based in Fairfax, Virginia, with 29 branch offices located across the United States. 
Industry and Market Dynamics
ASGN delivers staffing and consulting services in the technology, digital and creative fields across commercial and government sectors. ASGN helps leading corporate enterprises and government organizations develop, implement and operate critical IT and business solutions through its integrated offering of professional staffing and IT consulting services and solutions. 
Our total addressable market is approximately $488.0 billion. It includes $348.0 billion in IT consulting and professional staffing and $140.0 billion in government IT services and solutions. The Staffing Industry Analysts' U.S. Staffing Industry Forecast (September 2021 Update) projects the U.S. staffing industry will bounce back from declines experienced in 2020, driven by six percent U.S. gross domestic product growth.

We anticipate that our clients will increase their use of contract labor, professional staffing and consulting services in 2022. By using our contract labor professional staffing and consulting services, our clients benefit from cost structure advantages, flexibility to address fluctuating demand in business, and access to greater expertise. Our business model continues to evolve in line with client needs and expectations to focus on higher-end, higher-margin IT consulting services and solutions capabilities, particularly those related to digital transformation and other areas of technology change and specialization including data analytics, artificial intelligence/machine learning, big data, process automation and information security. We intend to continue to grow our diverse client base by focusing on large, stable accounts that are quick adopters of new technologies. We will invest in our organic growth, and we will look to execute acquisitions in the commercial and federal government end markets that provide us with new solution capabilities, industry expertise or contract vehicles.
Clients
We serve our clients by effectively understanding their IT, consulting and digital creative marketing services needs and providing them qualified professionals with a unique combination of skills, experience and expertise to meet those needs. Our clients set rigorous requirements for the talent they are seeking, and we use our extensive databases and deep relationships with our contract professionals to quickly identify and pre-screen candidates whose qualifications meet those requirements. We are responsible for recruiting, verifying credentials upon request, hiring, administering pay and benefits, compliance and training, as applicable. In 2021, revenues from the U.S. federal government were approximately 25.2 percent of consolidated revenues and no other client represented more than 10 percent of revenues.
Candidates
We recruit candidates with backgrounds in IT services and consulting and digital creative marketing who seek contract work opportunities. When we place these candidates on assignments or consulting projects with clients, they become our employees. Many of these contract professionals, and those we place via subcontractors, are paid hourly wage or contract rates based on their specific skills and whether or not the assignment involves travel away from their primary residence. We pay the related costs of employment including social security taxes, federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other similar costs for our employees. After achieving minimum service periods and/or hours worked, our contract professionals are offered access to medical and other voluntary benefit programs (e.g., dental, vision, disability) and the right to participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan. Each contract professional’s employment relationship with us is terminable at will. We placed approximately 52,900 contract professionals throughout 2021.
Strategy
ASGN's strategy is to be a leading provider of IT services and professional solutions, including technology, creative, and digital, across the commercial and federal government sectors. We are focused on high-margin work with high-volume scalable clients and projects, at large commercial enterprise accounts and federal government customers. We have built a sizable commercial consulting platform and we plan to continue to grow our revenues through both organic and acquisitive growth. Our acquisition strategy focuses on IT consulting companies that add new services, capabilities and contracts that support our commercial and federal government customer needs.
Our strategic innovation efforts and technology investments focus on putting the best productivity tools in the hands of our recruiters, our candidates and our clients, making it easy for clients and contract professionals to work with ASGN. We respond to emerging trends in digitization and candidate sourcing to better position our businesses and improve how we serve clients and consultants.
Competition
We see ourselves as a hybrid between pure staff augmentation and pure play consulting due to the way in which we provide human capital on a project-by-project basis. We compete with other large publicly-held and privately-owned providers of human capital in the professional staffing and IT and management consulting service segments on a local, regional, national and international basis across the commercial and government sectors. With an industry focus that is supported by our solutions, our unique deployment model allows us to provide the right services combined with experienced engagement leaders and methodologies that help our clients solve problems and create value.
From a talent perspective, unlike our competitors, we offer more opportunities for the billable professional and are viewed as a better partner for their career objectives. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified candidates are salaries and benefits; availability and variety of opportunities; quality, duration and location of assignments (if not remote/hybrid); and responsiveness to requests for placement. Many people seeking contract employment through us may also be pursuing employment through other means. Therefore, the speed at which we assign prospective professionals and the availability of attractive and appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to fill open positions. 
From a client perspective, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients are properly assessing the clients’ specific job and project requirements, the appropriateness of the professional assigned to the client, the price of services and monitoring our clients’ satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors and maintain an intimacy with our clients that enables us to successfully compete in the market, we expect competition to continue to increase. Unlike our competitors, particularly in the traditional consulting space, we do not rely upon a bench to support us and rather use our database and a deep labor pool of highly skilled technical talent developed over decades to provide and build teams that offer our clients a full suite of services from staff augmentation to traditional consulting. This shared resource model provides sophisticated project delivery capabilities with a cost advantage that have enabled us to grow above industry averages.
Human Capital
People are the core of ASGN. Our diverse talent pool helps build a strong workforce and maintain our competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,900 internal employees, including staffing consultants, regional sales directors, account managers, recruiters and corporate office employees. We support our employees and contract professionals through the following initiatives:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion — Based on our latest census data, women accounted for approximately 43 percent of our internal workforce and non-white employees accounted for approximately 39 percent of our internal workforce. ASGN has diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") training, recruitment, retention and advancement programs across all brands, which include mandatory training to raise awareness and eliminate unconscious bias in hiring and promotion practices. In addition, Apex Systems has a DEI manager and a program designed to encourage and support personal and professional development for employees from all ethnicities, races, religions and backgrounds and empower more women to become leaders. We are intentionally elevating our corporate culture across our brands and aim to be a leader in all areas of corporate social responsibility. We are making company-wide commitments to increasing ethnic and racial diversity, as well as gender equality across all levels of employment, including leadership positions. In 2021, we reached our goal to increase diversity in our Board of Directors and now have three Board members who are women, and two members who identify as non-white on our 11-member Board.
Work Practices and Employee Well-Being — Our training and development opportunities address, among other things, ethics and integrity; diversity and workplace inclusion; discrimination and harassment; unconscious bias; cybersecurity, privacy and information security; and workplace safety. In 2020, we added COVID-19 trainings to ensure the safety of all of our employees and to establish workplace policies that protect our employees, contract professionals and clients from COVID-19-related risks. Also in 2020, when most of our workforce began working remotely, we began supporting flexible work schedules for our working parents. We reward employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including medical, dental and vision plans; short- and long-term disability; life and accident insurance; health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts; and savings plans. We further support our employees emotional and physical health with wellness programming and personal growth workshops.
Employee Engagement, Retention and Development — We are committed to career advancement through training and development that supports both personal and professional growth. Employees are provided with a comprehensive training program of continued education that helps them stay ahead and deliver excellent results, including continued education and professional development. To promote more employee engagement in areas that are most meaningful to our diverse array of employees, we are supporting the development of Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"). ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups whose aim is to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with the organizations they serve and are designed to provide personal support and/or career development and create a safe space where employees can bring their whole selves to the table. They are also designed to help diverse employees be better prepared to move up within the organization. All our Commercial Segment divisions now have ERGs in place, while our Federal Government Segment is earnestly working to develop ERGs in 2022. The following ERGs are currently in place or are in development: Black, Experienced Professionals (50+), Inclusive Cultures, Interfaith, LGBTQ+, Parents/Caregivers, Military Families and Women. 
Collaborative Performance Management — We strongly support the belief that our employees should be the primary drivers of their own career growth. Employees are encouraged to seek opportunities that align with their long-term career goals, whether that be lateral job changes, cross-functional training, serving on committees or special projects, or any activity that will help to progress their career. Our performance management process emphasizes clear goals with timely and constructive feedback.

Government Regulation

We take reasonable steps to ensure that our contract professionals possess all current licenses and certifications required for each placement. We provide state-mandated workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and professional liability insurance for our internal employees and our contract professionals who are our employees. These expenses have a direct effect on our costs of services, margins and likelihood of achieving or maintaining profitability.
