Item 1. | Business

We are a leading food and beverage company and the largest processor and direct-to-store distributor of fresh fluid milk and other dairy and dairy case products in the United States, with a vision to be the most admired and trusted provider of wholesome, great-tasting dairy products at every occasion.
We manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of branded and private label dairy and dairy case products, including fluid milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, ice cream mix and other dairy products to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, educational institutions and governmental entities across the United States. Our portfolio includes DairyPure®, the country's first and largest fresh, national white milk brand, and TruMoo®, the leading national flavored milk brand, along with well-known regional dairy brands such as Alta Dena®, Berkeley Farms®, Country Fresh®, Dean’s®, Friendly's®, Garelick Farms®, LAND O LAKES® milk and cultured products (licensed brand), Lehigh Valley Dairy Farms®, Mayfield®, McArthur®, Meadow Gold®, Oak Farms®, PET ® (licensed brand), T.G. Lee®, Tuscan® and more. In all, we have more than 50 national, regional and local dairy brands, as well as private labels. We also sell and distribute organic juice, probiotic-infused juices, and fruit-infused waters under the Uncle Matt's Organic® brand. Additionally, we are party to the Organic Valley Fresh joint venture which distributes organic milk under the Organic Valley® brand to retailers. With our majority interest acquisition of Good Karma Foods, Inc. ("Good Karma"), which was completed on June 29, 2018, we now sell and distribute flax-based beverages and yogurt products under the Good Karma® brand.  Dean Foods also makes and distributes juices, teas and bottled water. Due to the perishable nature of our products, we deliver the majority of our products directly to our customers’ locations in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. We believe that we have one of the most extensive refrigerated direct-to-store delivery ("DSD") systems in the United States. We sell our products primarily on a local or regional basis through our local and regional sales forces, and in some instances, with the assistance of brokers. Some national customer relationships are coordinated by our centralized corporate sales department.

We sell our products primarily on a local or regional basis through our local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by a centralized corporate sales department. Our largest customer is Walmart Inc., including its subsidiaries such as Sam’s Club, which accounted for approximately 15.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our brands include DairyPure®, the country's first and largest fresh, white milk national brand, and TruMoo®, the leading national flavored milk brand. As of December 31, 2018, our national, local and regional proprietary and licensed brands included the following:

We currently operate 58 manufacturing facilities in 29 states located largely based on customer needs and other market factors, with distribution capabilities across all 50 states. For more information about our facilities, see “Item 2. Properties.” Due to the perishable nature of our products, we deliver the majority of our products directly to our customers’ locations in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a “direct-to-store delivery” or “DSD” system. We believe that we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States.
The primary raw material used in our products is conventional raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat) that we purchase primarily from farmers’ cooperatives, as well as from independent farmers. The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat on a monthly basis. Another significant raw material we use is resin, which is a fossil fuel-based product used to make plastic bottles. The price of resin fluctuates based on changes in crude oil and natural gas prices. Other raw materials and commodities used by us include diesel fuel, used to operate our extensive DSD system, and juice concentrates and sweeteners used in our products. We generally increase or decrease the prices of our private label fluid dairy products on a monthly basis in correlation with fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, packaging supplies and delivery costs. We manage the pricing of our branded fluid milk products on a longer-term basis, balancing consumer demand with net price realization but, in some cases, we are subject to the terms of sales agreements with respect to the means and/or timing of price increases.
We have several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf-space with retailers is based primarily on price, service, quality and the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors’ products. In some cases we pay fees to customers for shelf-space. Competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as price, taste preference, quality and brand recognition. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Additionally, we face competitive pressures from vertically integrated retailers, discount supermarket chains, dairy cooperatives and other processors, and online and delivery grocery retailers.

The fluid milk category enjoys a number of attractive attributes. This category’s size and pervasiveness, plus the limited shelf life of the product, make it an important category for retailers and consumers, as well as a large long-term opportunity for the best positioned dairy processors. However, the dairy industry is not without some well documented challenges. It is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized as highly competitive and subject to commodity volatility, with low profit margins. Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), consumption of fluid milk continues to decline. 
 For more information on factors that could impact our business, see “— Government Regulation — Milk Industry Regulation” and “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Known Trends and Uncertainties — Conventional Raw Milk and Other Inputs.” See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment, geographic and customer information.
Current Business Strategy
Dean Foods has evolved over the past 20 years through periods of rapid acquisition, consolidation, integration and the separation of our operations including the spin-off of The WhiteWave Foods Company ("WhiteWave") and sale of Morningstar Foods ("Morningstar") in 2013. Today, we are a leading food and beverage company and the largest processor and direct-to-store distributor of fresh fluid milk and other dairy and dairy case products in the United States. 
Our vision is to be the most admired and trusted provider of wholesome, great-tasting dairy products at every occasion. Our strategy is to invest and grow our portfolio of brands while strengthening our operations and capabilities to achieve a more profitable core business. Our strategy is anchored by the following five pillars and is underscored by our commitments to safety, quality and service, and delivering sustainable profit growth and total shareholder return:
Win in Private Label:

• | Enhance our profitability by lowering our internal costs, partnering with our customers and driving standard practices across our business.


• | Enhance our profitability by strategically targeting key customers and channels.

Deliver Operational Excellence:

• | Reset our cost structure through the execution of our enterprise-wide cost productivity plan, including rescaling our supply chain, optimizing spend management and integrating our operating model.


• | Consolidate our manufacturing and distribution network to better align with our current and projected volumes.

Transform Go To Market:

• | Expand our reach and ability to meet evolving consumer needs.


• | More profitably serve customers through new delivery and production capabilities.


• | Drive efficiency through standardized business principles and customer collaboration.

Enhance Future Capabilities:

• | Foster an engaged and aligned organization that has a consumer mindset.


• | Improve processes, technology and infrastructure to enable cross-functional decision-making that creates opportunities to build our business.

Build and Buy Strong Brands:

• | Build our existing brands with consumer-led innovation, marketing, and logistical excellence.


• | Evaluate and consider strategic opportunities.


• | Diversify our portfolio in adjacent categories.

Corporate Responsibility
Within our business strategies, corporate responsibility remains an integral part of our efforts. As we work to strengthen our business, we are committed to do it in a way that is right for our employees, shareholders, consumers, customers, suppliers and the environment. We intend to realize savings by reducing waste and duplication while we continue to support programs that improve our local communities. We believe that our customers, consumers and suppliers value our efforts to operate in an ethical, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible manner.

Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonal changes in the demand for dairy products. Sales volumes are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to increased dairy consumption during seasonal holidays. Fluid milk volumes tend to decrease in the second and third quarters of the year primarily due to the reduction in dairy consumption associated with our school customers, partially offset by the increase in ice cream and ice cream mix consumption during the summer months. Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, fluctuations in volumes and revenue from quarter to quarter may have a material effect on operating income for the respective quarters. 
Intellectual Property
We are continually developing new technology and enhancing existing proprietary technology related to our dairy operations. Seven U.S. and eight international patents have been issued to us, two U.S. patents have been allowed, and three U.S. and five international patent applications are pending. Our U.S. patents are expected to expire at various dates between February 2019 and December 2035. If the pending U.S. patent applications are granted, those patents would be expected to expire at various dates between June 2035 and October 2037. Our international patents are expected to expire at various dates between February 2028 and March 2030. If the pending international patent applications are granted, those patents would be expected to expire in September 2037. 
We primarily rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. Despite these protections, it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy, obtain or use certain portions of our proprietary technology or trademarks. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,000 employees. Approximately 38% of our employees participate in a multitude of collective bargaining agreements of varying duration and terms.
Government Regulation
Food-Related Regulations
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:

• | regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations;


• | specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and


• | prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels.

 We are also subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which, among other things, mandates the FDA to adopt preventative controls to be implemented by food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients. In addition, all of our facilities have achieved Safety Quality Food ("SQF") Level 3 under the Global Food Safety Initiative. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe our facilities and manufacturing practices are in material compliance with all government regulations applicable to our business.
Employee Safety Regulations
We are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business.
6

Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various state and federal environmental laws, regulations and directives, including the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Our plants use a number of chemicals that are considered to be “extremely” hazardous substances pursuant to applicable environmental laws due to their toxicity, including ammonia, which is used extensively in our operations as a refrigerant. Such chemicals must be handled in accordance with such environmental laws. Also, on occasion, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels allowed under local regulations. As a result, certain of our facilities are required to pay wastewater surcharges or to construct wastewater pretreatment facilities. To date, such wastewater surcharges and construction costs have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We maintain above-ground and under-ground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. We periodically inspect these tanks to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable regulations and, as a result of such inspections, we are required to make expenditures from time to time to ensure that these tanks remain in compliance. In addition, upon removal of the tanks, we are sometimes required to make expenditures to restore the site in accordance with applicable environmental laws. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future. In addition, any asset retirement obligations are not material.
Milk Industry Regulation
The federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in federally regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk primarily contains raw skim milk in addition to a small percentage of butterfat. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested to determine the percentage of butterfat and other milk components, and we pay our suppliers for the raw milk based on the results of these tests.
The federal government’s minimum prices for Class I milk vary depending on the processor’s geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into Class I products such as fluid milk) and Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into Class II products such as cottage cheese, creams, creamers, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices are announced either at the end of the month or the first week of the following month in which the price is effective. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also may pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and supplier.
Labeling Regulations
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA has authority to review product labeling, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) may review labeling and advertising materials including online and television advertisements, to determine if advertising materials are misleading. Similarly, many states review dairy product labels to determine whether they comply with applicable state laws. We believe we are in material compliance with all labeling laws and regulations applicable to our business.
We are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws.
