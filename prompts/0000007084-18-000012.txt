Concentration of Revenues by Product
The following products account for 10% or more of revenues for the following periods:

 | % of Revenues 
 | Year Ended December 31
 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
Soybeans | 17% | 17% | 16% 
Soybean Meal | 13% | 13% | 13% 
Corn | 10% | 10% | 11% 

Status of New Products
The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.  Acquisitions, especially in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment, expand the Company’s ability to serve the customers’ evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products. The Company does not expect any of its new products to have a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2018. 
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
Substantially all of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, EMEA, Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.  The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
The Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses, principally consisting of $222 million of trademarks from the Wild Flavors acquisition in 2014, but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses. 
Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers
Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.

The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements.  Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.  Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.  Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.
Competition
The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.

Research and Development Expenditures
The Company’s research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers’ product development or formulation needs, improving processing efficiency, and developing food, feed, fuel, and industrial products from renewable agricultural crops.  Research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, net of reimbursements of government grants, was approximately $129 million, $123 million, and $122 million, respectively.
The Company’s laboratories and technical centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers in Europe, Asia, and South America, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients. The acquisition of Wild Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development. Since that time, additional laboratories have been added, including food & beverages applications laboratories in Sydney, Australia and Cranbury, New Jersey as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur, Illinois and Singapore.
The Company is working with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory and other key academic and corporate partners on carbon sequestration projects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations. The second carbon sequestration project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture & Sequestration, started carbon dioxide injection in April 2017.
The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products.  The key materials are derived from the Company’s starch and oilseed-based feedstocks.  Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis.  The materials pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently produced from petrochemical resources as well as new-to-the-market bio-based products. The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. The Company’s project with DuPont to develop sustainable packaging solutions with improved barrier properties has progressed to the construction of a demonstration semi-works plant. This facility, which will be completed in early 2018, will provide both development samples for customers as well as engineering data for a full scale plant.
The Company is also expanding its human health and nutrition portfolio with the acquisition of an 89% controlling interest in Biopolis SL (Biopolis), a leading provider of probiotics and genomic services. Biopolis provides genomic sequencing capabilities for the Company's customers as well as for its internal use. Biopolis also has high through-put biological functionality testing capabilities that can be used to discover new probiotics and nutraceuticals. In September 2017, the Company announced a collaboration with the Mayo Clinic to study gut microflora with respect to personalized nutrition.
In January 2018, the Company announced a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize enzymes for animal feed.

ADM Ventures, which was launched by the Company in October 2016, has made its first selections of high-potential, new-product development projects from its business units. ADM Ventures is also looking at several promising, early-stage start-up companies in which the Company may wish to invest.
Environmental Compliance
During the year ended December 31, 2017, $40 million was spent specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.
There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.

Item 1. | BUSINESS (Continued)

A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including, but not limited to, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and its member states, and China. The Company's operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company’s business could be affected in the future by additional global, regional, national, and local regulation, pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation, regulation or agreements. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements. Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.
Number of Employees
The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 31,300 at December 31, 2017 and 31,800 at December 31, 2016.  The net decrease in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company's global workforce and divestitures, partially offset by acquisitions.
