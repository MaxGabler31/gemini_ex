Item 1. Business 
Our Mission 
Bird’s mission is to provide environmentally friendly transportation for everyone. 
Our Company 
At Bird, we believe in leading the transition to clean, equitable transportation through innovation and technology. That means developing mobility solutions that put people and communities first. 
In partnership with cities, Bird’s proprietary technology and operations are revolutionizing the existing transportation paradigm by making lightweight electric vehicles readily available to rent or own around the world. We provide riders with a convenient alternative to transport themselves to work, to a local business or elsewhere in their communities. Our products and services are designed with one goal in mind: to make cities more livable by reducing car usage, lowering carbon emissions, and improving the safety of all road users. 
Bird’s cleaner, affordable, and on-demand mobility solutions are available in more than 400 cities across four continents. We take a collaborative, community-first approach to micromobility. By tailoring our operations to meet local transportation needs and collaborating with cities, we are actively reducing the hundreds of billions of trips under five miles made by gas-powered cars every year. Of the eight trillion trips taken globally each year, 60% are under five miles in length.
COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of environmentally conscious, socially distanced transportation alternatives such as Bird. As the world enters a new, post-pandemic “normal,” we are continuing to work with cities to increase micromobility access and infrastructure investments to ensure that the shift to sustainable urban transportation continues. In response to COVID-19, many cities and towns have adopted favorable regulations for shared micromobility and invested in infrastructure to support affordable and safe transportation alternatives.
Advancing Transportation for the Modern Era 
In most places, the current transportation paradigm is dangerous, inefficient, and environmentally detrimental. 
Counties like Los Angeles have dedicated significant land area to roadways and car parking infrastructure, while global deaths due to automobile collisions have ballooned to 1.35 million per year. Furthermore, in the United States, the transportation industry has become the single largest polluter, accounting for nearly 30% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. This is unsustainable, and it is having a particularly dire impact in urban areas.
Bird’s offerings, including our core vehicle-sharing business and operations (“Sharing”), and our sales of Bird-designed vehicles for personal use (“Product Sales”), address the transportation problems that are plaguing communities around the world. In partnership with cities, we are accelerating access to environmentally friendly transportation alternatives that make more efficient use of existing infrastructure.
The Bird Solution 
As the first company to deploy shared e-scooters, Bird provided a new transportation category that is accessible, efficient, and reliable. The prevalence and rapid adoption of e-scooter sharing has accelerated the transition away from the legacy, car-centric transportation system while helping to alleviate the hefty financial and environmental burden of car ownership and usage for short trips. 
Shared micromobility has many advantages over traditional transportation modes. Unlike personal cars, ride-hail services, and taxis, micromobility does not directly contribute to air pollution and congestion. For many, shared micromobility such as e-scooters provide a more efficient form of transportation for trips under five miles.
As a means of transportation, our vehicles provide an affordable and accessible alternative to car ownership. Bird provides riders with an array of vehicles on-demand that can get them to their destination reliably and affordably. Economic uncertainty and strains on public transit systems related to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to decreased availability of more traditional transportation services, creating transit deserts. In partnership with cities and local transit organizations, Bird and its suite of shared micromobility vehicles are helping to fill the gaps with cleaner, more affordable, and more socially distant modes of transportation. 
Our Offerings 
Our offerings can be categorized into Sharing and Product Sales. 
Sharing 
Our Sharing business, Bird’s core offering since 2017, provides riders with on-demand access to Bird vehicles through our mobile application (the “Bird App”). 
Users can download the Bird App on both Android and iOS smartphone platforms and become an eligible Bird rider following a brief onboarding process. This process requires users to confirm their age, follow a vehicle operation tutorial, and acknowledge safety guidance and local regulations before their first ride. Once completed, eligible riders can use the Bird App to locate nearby vehicles. Riders also have the ability to reserve an available Bird vehicle up to 30 minutes in advance. When they are ready for their trip, riders can unlock a Bird using a smartphone to scan the QR code on the vehicle or by manually entering the vehicle identification code located on each vehicle. For riders without access to a smartphone, they can text Bird directly to begin a ride. 
Bird generates revenue in the form of ride fees from trips taken by our customers. For a single ride, riders typically pay a standard unlock fee in addition to a per-minute price for each minute the vehicle is unlocked. Payment is processed in-app after the rider confirms parking compliance. 
Since our first shared ride in 2017, we have facilitated over 130 million trips on Bird vehicles through our Sharing business. In the last year alone, over five million new riders registered to use our vehicles. 
To scale our mission, we offer a white labeled version of our products and technology (“Bird Platform”). Bird Platform partners purchase and hold title to fleets of Bird-designed vehicles to operate in their local markets. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 91% and 85%, respectively, of our total revenue was generated from our Sharing business. 
Product Sales 
In addition to our Sharing business, we offer consumers the opportunity to purchase Bird vehicles for personal use through the Bird website and in select retail stores. 
Bird’s Product Sales business makes environmentally conscious transportation accessible to a broader population and expands our reach to markets where we do not currently operate shared fleets. Our Product Sales customers are essential brand ambassadors and, even more so, a vital part in championing a new global micromobility paradigm. 
In 2019, we launched our first vehicle available for retail purchase, the Bird One. Since then, we have expanded our retail product line to include the Bird Bike, Bird Air and Bird Flex, each with a “stow and go” vehicle design, and Birdie and Birdie Glow, three-wheeled non-electric scooters designed for kids. We also recognize sales of Bird-designed vehicles to Bird Platform partners as Product Sales.
Operating Model Evolution 
In-market operations for our Sharing business are managed either via in-house teams (“In-House”) or with the support of a network of local logistics providers (“Fleet Managers”). 
In-House
Prior to the second quarter of 2020, substantially all of our in-market fleet operations were conducted In-House. This legacy operating model relied on Bird employees and contingent workers to manage certain day-to-day tasks and responsibilities related to maintaining our vehicles with support from independent contractors for certain ancillary tasks. After temporarily pausing operations at the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020, we rapidly shifted to the Fleet Manager operating model as a way to provide safe and socially distanced operations. As of December 31, 2021, 95% of our in-market operations, excluding Bird Platform, were supported by Fleet Managers. 
Fleet Managers 
The Fleet Manager operating model aims to provide economic advancement and small business management opportunities across the globe. Known as Fleet Managers, these entrepreneurs and their businesses typically manage logistics for 100 or more Bird vehicles each, driving meaningful scale on a hyper-local level. Unlike our legacy In-House operating model, Fleet Managers are compensated via a revenue sharing model, generating revenue from trips taken on Bird vehicles in their fleet. They are responsible for deploying, repairing, relocating, sanitizing, and charging their designated fleet of Bird vehicles. There are no upfront fees to Bird associated with becoming a Fleet Manager, and Fleet Managers typically utilize existing tools and resources to manage their fleet.
Fleet Managers often possess local knowledge and insights that make them uniquely positioned to operate successfully on a block-by-block basis. Through shared knowledge and clear communication among Bird, our Fleet Managers, and the cities in which we operate, our hyper-localized shared micromobility network provides top-quality service to communities and economic advancement opportunities to our local service providers. 
Why Bird Wins 
Several core advantages and differentiators have driven and will continue to drive Bird’s extraordinary adoption. These include: 
Founder-Led Management Team with a Culture of Innovation 
Bird’s founder, Travis VanderZanden, is an experienced entrepreneur and mobility executive. After four years in leadership roles at Uber and Lyft, he saw an opportunity to create a solution designed specifically to address congestion and pollution caused by gas-powered private car and ride-hail trips that are five miles or less. Passionate about relieving congestion and reducing air pollution, he set out to create a solution that was fun to use, environmentally friendly, and utilized existing infrastructure. His vision and leadership propel innovation and Bird’s sharp sense of purpose, enabling us to attract top-tier leaders and talent, drive engagement, and power our unprecedented growth. Mr. VanderZanden has also fostered a strong culture of innovation in support of the company’s mission. 
Category Creator with Advanced Technology and Data Platform 
Designed and engineered specifically for shared use, we have equipped our vehicles with features to optimize sustainability, safety, and performance-long-lasting battery, theft protection, and GPS-tracking that allows riders to lock, unlock, and locate our vehicles remotely from their smart devices. In addition to optimizing performance and rider experience, Bird-designed vehicles bolster our unit economics, reducing costs associated with repairs and maintenance and extending overall vehicle lifespan, which leads to increased rides per vehicle. 
Like our vehicles, Bird’s software and firmware is purpose-built to enhance user experience for each of our key stakeholders. The Bird App provides a user-friendly interface, where riders can locate, book, and pay for on-demand rides. We have developed a highly configurable, real-time data platform with which our vehicles and applications communicate, providing real-time data, insights, and resources to ensure our vehicles are both utilized and in compliance with an array of local regulations. 
Mutually Beneficial Fleet Manager Operating Model 
We have realized the benefits of economies of learning. With each year of operation and each ride, we evaluate and improve upon our business model and offerings to ensure we are providing our riders, cities, and other business partners with the best possible experience. One of our key learnings was that we could optimize our service to provide a hyper-localized Sharing business for our riders while offering economic opportunity at the local level. These discoveries and aspirations were the genesis of our Fleet Manager program. 
Fleet Managers typically utilize existing tools and resources to manage logistics for the vehicles in their fleet. Fleet Managers make money on rides taken on vehicles in their care, creating built-in economic incentives to ensure vehicles are properly maintained, frequently cleaned, and strategically placed to align with local demand. 
Strong Year-Round Unit Economics 
The aligned operational incentives and revenue share construct of the Fleet Manager program bolster Bird’s leading unit economics and help reduce the impact of seasonality. The Fleet Manager model provides Bird with a means to achieve ride-level profitability even during periods of suppressed demand, while providing a positive return to Fleet Managers. 
In the year ended December 31, 2021, Ride Profit Margins (before Vehicle Depreciation) (as defined elsewhere in this Form 10-K/A) were 49% of Sharing revenue as compared to 20% in the year ended December 31, 2020, despite continued pandemic-related headwinds, varying seasonal conditions, and global supply chain disruptions. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information. 
Our Growth Strategy
Since first offering shared e-scooters in the fall of 2017, we have launched fleets of environmentally conscious vehicles in over 400 cities worldwide. Our riders have taken over 130 million trips on Bird scooters since our launch, tens of millions of which would have otherwise been made by car. We intend to build upon our market leadership and grow our business through the following strategies: 
Continue to Build on Our Presence in Existing Regions 
We will continue to invest in and expand our footprint in existing regions in order to help cities meet their climate action goals, and optimize rider experience by providing increased availability and reliability. By expanding our coverage in each location, we believe we will replace more car trips that are five miles or less, attract new riders, grow our market opportunity, increase ride frequency, and improve rider retention with convenient solutions such as our Quick Start feature and integration with other transportation modes, which remove the need for riders to leave our ecosystem. As part of this effort, we expect to continue investing in scaling operations to smaller markets with less than 500,000 residents (“long-tail markets”) and low-income communities in urban areas, both historically underserved by the micromobility industry. We believe that we are more likely to win new city bids within a region where we have demonstrated our ability to provide best-in-class coverage to cross-jurisdictional cities. Therefore, we intend to expand into adjacent cities and localities to create a connected and seamless area of coverage for riders within a given region. 
Scale to New Regions 
We have made our solutions available in countries outside of North America and Europe, and we expect to continue to expand our global footprint, entering new and high-growth regions where we see significant long-term market potential with the opportunity to drive greater mode shift and capture new customers or better serve our existing customers. We are able to leverage historical demand data to identify opportunities, both in entering new markets and providing service to underserved areas of competitive markets. 
Further Enhance Our Rider Experience 
We will continue to improve and expand our services to offer a best-in-class customer experience. Further, we plan to utilize our data and analytics capabilities to proactively manage customer relationships and outcomes via promotional activities, marketing initiatives, and targeted features. Through this ongoing commitment to our riders, we hope to drive rider engagement and retention. 
Expand Services and Support for Our Fleet Managers 
Fleet Managers are important partners to our business, as they directly help us in our mission to provide localized, environmentally friendly transportation services to communities across the globe. Therefore, we want to create meaningful opportunities for these businesses to grow and succeed. In order to support these initiatives, we plan to continue to invest in tools aimed at improving inventory management, repairs, and fleet load balancing, enabling them to optimize their services. Further, we plan to create opportunities for Fleet Managers to collaborate, cross-pollinate best practices, and foster a sense of community. By empowering Fleet Managers, we enable better performance and in turn boost utilization and access. We believe taking these steps will help Fleet Managers provide industry leading offerings, all the while bolstering bottom-line results for both parties and improving the rider experience. 
Bolster Our Data Platform and Analytics Capabilities 
As part of our operations, we work in concert with several key stakeholders, including Fleet Managers, city transit authorities, and Bird Platform partners. To make the management of micromobility programs seamless for all stakeholders, we plan to invest in our city-facing data dashboards and analytics capabilities to drive insights and better inform operating decisions. As part of this initiative, we plan to continue building on our existing capabilities in GPS positioning, sidewalk detection, autonomous braking, and mass transit integration. By improving our ability to collect and learn from these data points, we believe that we will be able to support fleet optimization and offer cities a differentiated value proposition when choosing to partner with us. Collectively, we believe these outcomes will improve availability for customers, generate revenue for Bird and our Fleet Manager partners, and improve city-planning and management initiatives. 
Invest in New Form Factors 
Building on our experience in micromobility hardware design and engineering, we aim to develop new and exciting micro e-vehicles, such as our shared e-bike, the Bird Bike, that will allow us to address existing gaps in our current offerings, better serve multimodal cities, and expand our annual serviceable addressable market by over $20 billion. In addition to addressing the growing needs of the communities in which we operate, these new form factors will support a range of trip distances and weather conditions, providing our riders with more opportunities to replace car trips. Continued investment in our proprietary designs will improve our offerings and drive a better experience for riders while further increasing the durability and lifespan of our vehicles. 
Expand Vehicle Financing Capabilities 
Our multi-year track record of vehicle retention and revenue generation from over 130 million global rides allowed us to finance our vehicle purchases with asset-level debt, and in April 2021, we secured a $40 million asset financing credit facility from Apollo Investment Corporation and MidCap Financial Trust (each managed or advised by Apollo Capital Management, L.P. or its affiliates). In October 2021, we amended the facility to, among other things, increase the amount available thereunder to $150 million. This asset financing structure better matches our capital expenditure outflows to seasonal peaks when vehicles generate the most cash and includes a repayment mechanism tied directly to revenue generation. Moreover, this facility further improves equity returns without the restrictive covenants of a traditional credit facility and directly supports our growth ambitions. 
Our Applications 
Bird’s software applications are purpose-built for riders, Fleet Managers, and city partners. We are dedicated to providing best-in-class resources and tools for all stakeholders and enabling a seamless experience. Our core software applications are as follows: 
Riders 
The Bird App allows riders to seamlessly locate, reserve, unlock, and pay for a ride on one of our vehicles. With its built-in map, users have real-time insight into the vehicle inventory nearby. To start a trip, riders simply scan the vehicle’s QR code using the Bird App. Once they arrive at their destination or are ready to end their trip, riders use the Bird App to take a photo of the parked vehicle to confirm it is parked properly. Through the Bird App, riders have visibility into local operational areas and will receive alerts if they attempt to ride a vehicle out of the permitted zones. 
Our team has been listening to and learning from our riders around the world, inspiring the development of several exciting initiatives, including free unlock promotions, subscription ride passes, and loyalty programs. 
By adding new pricing plans based on rider needs and making them available in cities worldwide, we are able to extend the reach and long-term benefits of micromobility to millions of additional people around the world. Riders can use the Bird App to view pricing and see which plans are available to them. 
Fleet Managers 
The success of Bird’s Fleet Manager partners is closely linked to our own. That is why we provide each Fleet Manager with access to a Fleet Manager dashboard, a suite of tools and information designed to support compliant operations while also providing crucial data and insights to help optimize performance of fleet services. Through a customized interface, Fleet Managers can easily locate vehicles in their fleet, track status and battery levels, and identify issues. 
Cities
Bird partners with cities across the globe to develop programs that maximize the positive impact of micromobility while helping to drive progress on localized climate action plans and Vision Zero goals. We work with cities to ensure they have the tools to access and analyze data they need, while implementing robust technical security and data management policies. Our City App dashboards provide a tailored view of Bird data, customized to each city’s needs. Our in-depth API allows cities to analyze trends and measure the impact of micromobility, all while identifying issues and improving infrastructure within communities. 
Our Vehicles 
Sharing Vehicles 
Bird e-scooters benefit from our vehicle engineering team’s unique experience as the innovators of the shared micromobility industry. Many of the custom features in Bird-designed e-scooters were built to respond to challenges unique to the shared micromobility industry and the needs of our city partners. For example, the Bird Three features an extended deck and additional mechanical brake for safer riding, a sensor fusion microchip for sidewalk detection, and a neck status indicator light. Our e-scooters are compact in size and come equipped with a dual-sided kickstand designed to prevent the vehicle from tipping over. We continue to improve our e-scooter design to both further facilitate rider safety and increase vehicle lifetime.
As of December 31, 2021, our global fleet of Bird-designed e-scooters is comprised of 37% Bird Three, 26% Bird Two, 26% Bird One, and 11% Bird Zero. 
In June 2021, we launched our e-bike sharing service to meet fast-growing demand from cities and riders for more sustainable transportation options. Each bike is equipped with a high-powered electric motor capable of powering riders up hills with as much as a 20% grade, while its 75-pound frame and step through design offers riders a sturdy yet maneuverable vehicle. Additionally, the shared Bird Bike has a front basket for storage, large pneumatic tires, and IoT features such as self-automating onboard diagnostics, geospeed technology and multi-mode geolocation.
Our vehicles are speed-limited to ensure safety, operability, and compliance with local bike lane regulations. For special zoning and speed limit requirements, we work with cities to ensure our hardware and software are in compliance with specific local regulations. 
Retail Vehicles 
In partnership with a global network of distributors, we are able to offer Bird scooters to millions of customers who have yet to experience the benefits of micromobility. These offerings include: 
Bird Bike 
The Bird Bike is Bird’s first consumer e-bike, which was launched in response to increased demand for e-bikes, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bird Bike features a fully-integrated, backlit handlebar dash display, a 500 watt motor, a 50 mile range, and a 36 volt removable battery. 
Bird Air
The Bird Air personal e-scooter holds more than 30 U.S. and international safety certifications. This micro-electric vehicle features a “stow and go” vehicle design, aircraft-grade aluminum framing, self-sealing pneumatic tires, and enhanced front and rear lighting, making it both comfortable to ride and rugged enough to stand up to the demands of everyday use. The Bird Air has a range of up to 16 miles, and comes equipped with Bluetooth connectivity and advanced technology.
Bird Flex
Launched in late 2021, the Bird Flex micro-electric vehicle pulls from the commuter-friendly design of the Bird Air as a “stow and go” e-scooter. Built to provide stability and comfort while riding, it features street-tested, front-wheel suspension, dual brakes, and 10-inch diameter, puncture-proof tires. The Bird Flex has a range of up to 15 miles and also features an LED display, which shows battery life and speed. 
Birdie & Birdie Glow
Bird launched the Birdie in 2019 in response to the demand for a non-electric scooter designed for children. This kid-powered scooter is designed for children ages three and up. Birdies offer children-centric features, including no-slip grip, a 
safety stop button, three wheels for increased stability, and a height-adjustable T-bar. In December 2021, Bird launched the Birdie Glow, which includes the addition of new colorways and light-up wheels.
Bird One 
In 2019, the Bird One became the first Bird-designed vehicle available for purchase and personal ownership and the first Product Sales offering. Designed and engineered for frequent use, the Bird One features an extended battery life, enabling riders to travel up to 25 miles on a single charge, and comes in three unique colors: Electric Rose, Jet Black, and Dove White.
Research and Development Process 
Bird’s vehicle design and development process draws on the combined aerospace and automotive experience of our research and development (“R&D”) team. Primarily based in Culver City, California, our R&D team is laser-focused on designing and engineering superior micromobility vehicles for both shared and retail use. Our R&D process places outsized emphasis on validation, from concept to final product, and rigorously tests each component. Specifically, Bird has created a 250-step design validation process that ensures our vehicles are durable enough to withstand impact sustained from shared operations while maintaining their sleek, lightweight designs. We continue to build on our learnings from previous Bird-designed vehicles to enhance safety features, improve battery efficiency, and extend the half-life of each new model. 
Raw Materials and Components 
Our business is dependent on ensuring sufficient supply of our vehicles to satisfy demand from new markets, to meet increased demand in existing markets, or to replace churned vehicles. We are also reliant upon availability of spare parts to repair our vehicles. We rely on a limited number of international suppliers to produce and manufacture our vehicles and vehicle components. As such, material changes in trade policy, increases in materials and logistics costs, or global supply chain disruptions have impacted and could materially impact our results of operations. While we believe we have a robust supply chain, our financial results would be impacted if the supply or cost of vehicles or vehicle components were to change materially. 
Seasonality
We experience different levels of seasonality in each market in which we operate. Each market has unique seasonality, events, and weather that can increase or decrease rider demand for our shared micromobility offerings. For example, seasonality can be correlated to changes in the number of local residents and visitors, which may in turn be impacted by weather. Certain holidays have the potential to impact ride demand on the holiday itself or during the preceding and subsequent weekends. Additionally, inclement weather, including rain, snow, extreme temperatures, and natural disasters, tends to reduce the demand for our offerings. In order to mitigate the impact of seasonality and ensure our vehicles are protected, vehicles are proactively placed in reserve when we expect rider demand to decrease. When weather conditions improve or other seasonal factors increase demand for our services, we act quickly to redeploy vehicles and capture the upside. The seasonality of our businesses can also create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity, which can impact our financial performance, and results of operations. 
Competition 
The shared micromobility industry is relatively nascent and highly competitive. As a pioneer in the shared micromobility space, we compete with personal cars, ride-hail services, and other modes of transportation for trips under five miles point to point. 
In the shared micromobility industry, we face competition from companies who may have longer operating histories in related industries, greater brand recognition, or more substantial financial or marketing resources, as well as potential future entrants. In our Sharing business, we face competition from private car trips, other companies in the electric scooter and bike-sharing market, and companies in the broader ridesharing market (e.g., Lime/Uber, and Lyft). Our Product Sales business competes with companies that produce and sell electric scooters and bikes, as well as companies that produce and sell other vehicle modalities (e.g., Razor and Segway). Additionally, our Product Sales business may compete with shared, rental, and on-demand transit options based on consumer choice between self-owned and shared transit options. 
We believe we are well positioned to effectively compete with such companies due to (i) our superior rider experience, which solves many of the traditional mobility pain points, (ii) our large, growing, and highly engaged user base, (iii) aligned incentives in the mutually beneficial Fleet Manager operating model, (iv) our advanced technology and data platform, (v) our dedicated focus and commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives, such as our participation in the United Nations Global Compact, and (vi) our founder-led, visionary management team. 
For a discussion of risks relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and competition represents an ongoing threat to the growth and success of our business.” 
Marketing and Brand 
The trust and recognition of the Bird brand plays an important role in our success. Our brand and marketing efforts use a multichannel approach, including in-house content production and distribution (visual and editorial), Search Engine Optimization (SEO), social media and email, paid advertising, in-person events, virtual workshops, earned media, and retail and core platform business partnerships. We target our marketing and brand campaigns to our key audience types, including (i) acquisition, retention, and education campaigns for riders and (ii) policy-focused campaigns and partnerships for cities. We prioritize efficient, low-cost, and high-output growth strategies. 
Our Values and People 
Our values have been crafted to help us cultivate a workplace that is open and inclusive, an ambition that is insatiable, a culture that is mission-driven, and a company that is responsibly revolutionizing electric transportation around the world: 
•Community Focused. We care deeply about the people and cities we serve. Every day, we strive to be good citizens in our work communities, our home communities, and beyond. 
•Inclusive. We always seek the missing perspective. We embrace new ideas and are open and sensitive to different points of view to arrive at the best solutions and build the strongest team. 
•Efficient. We are obsessed with doing things intelligently, in a streamlined fashion that always takes time and money into consideration. We always look to do the most with what we have. 
•Entrepreneurial. We celebrate innovation and learn quickly from failure. Every day, we think about how to ideate and iterate efficiently in our work. 
•Impact Oriented. We are focused on results, work hard to achieve our mission, and inspire others to do the same. We always figure out how to get things done and approach each day with the goal of making the biggest impact we can. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 572 employees, all of which were full-time employees. 
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We further attempt to control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our mobile application and website. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality of, and frequent enhancements to, our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace. 
We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a portion of our strategic intellectual property in vehicle sharing, telecommunications, networking, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2021, we held six issued U.S. patents and had six U.S. patent applications pending. We also held five issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and had no applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. 
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand name and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2021, we held six registered trademarks in the United States, and also held 67 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks in certain jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.bird.co and other variations. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology—We may be parties to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation that is expensive to support, and if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on us and our stockholders” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology—If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.”
Government Regulation 
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations govern various items directly or indirectly related to our business, such as vehicle sharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, unionizing and collective action, product liability, vehicle defects, vehicle maintenance and repairs, personal injury, rider text messaging, service payments, gift cards, subscription services, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, intellectual property, competition, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, insurance, money transmittal, and environmental, health and safety. They are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. 
The micromobility industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. New laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, interpreted, and iterated upon in response to our growing industry and associated technology. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that (i) we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, (ii) we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or (iii) users on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities require us to obtain permits, pay fees, or comply with certain reporting and other requirements to provide our core ride-sharing solutions. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may do a number of things that inhibit our operations, such as reject our permit applications, revoke our existing permits, deny permit renewals, delay permissions, increase fees, charge new fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of errors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. 
Recent financial, political, or other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business. Further, due to changes in our operations, structure, or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another. Additionally, from time to time, we may invest resources in an effort to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations, particularly those related to the micromobility industry. 
We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban vehicle sharing. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations internationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. 
Our products and operations may also be subject to various environmental, health, and safety regulations, including, but not limited to, those regarding land use, product safety, and waste management. For example, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of the hazardous substance occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and seek to recover costs incurred from the responsible classes of persons. In the course of ordinary operations, we, through third parties and contractors, may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA and similar state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites as which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. 
We may also be subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes for the generation or disposal of solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes. RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, but, in particular, imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Provided that certain requirements are met, certain components of our charging stations may be excluded 
from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations; however, if these components do not meet all established requirements for the exclusion to apply, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, we may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste that are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Similarly, in Europe, the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive requires certain entities, such as Bird, to finance the collection and recycling of WEEE at product end-of-life. The WEEE Directive also sets registration requirements, collection and recycling targets, and other requirements. Compliance with the WEEE Directive may require substantial resources, and failure to comply may result in various penalties, including, but not limited to, fines or removal of our products from the market. Any changes in such laws or regulations, or any changes in our ability to qualify the materials used for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business performance or results of operations. 
Separately, as part of Bird’s mission, we aim to be an environmentally friendly company. We advertise the sustainability of our operations and purchase various carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates (“RECs”) in different regions of the world to improve our operations’ sustainability profile. Our claims based on the use of such offsets and RECs are governed by various regulations, such as the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) “Green Guides.” Additionally, various jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted, or are considering adopting, more stringent regulations regarding the characterization of various products or activities as “sustainable,” “climate-friendly,” or otherwise. There is no guarantee that the programs on which we currently rely will be allowed under such regulations, and any such differences may require us to spend significant time and resources to align our operations. If we do not, we may no longer be able to market our products or operations as sustainable, which could impact our reputation or otherwise negatively affect our operations. 
Certain of our products are also regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) pursuant to various federal laws. The CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities, and other countries in which we sell our products. 
Additionally, because we receive, use, transmit, disclose, and store personally identifiable information and other data relating to users on our platform, we are subject to numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection, and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data. Such regulations include the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the "FTC Act"), the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”).
