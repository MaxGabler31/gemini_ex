Item 1. | Business

Andeavor Logistics is a leading growth-oriented, full-service, and diversified midstream company operating in the western and inland regions of the United States. We were formed by Andeavor and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TLGP, our general partner, in December 2010 as a Delaware master limited partnership to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets. The Partnership’s common units trade on the NYSE under the symbol “ANDX.”
We own and operate networks of crude oil, refined products and natural gas pipelines, terminals with crude oil and refined products storage capacity, rail loading and offloading facilities, marine terminals including storage, bulk petroleum distribution facilities, a trucking fleet and natural gas processing and fractionation complexes. Our assets are organized in three segments: Terminalling and Transportation, Gathering and Processing and Wholesale.
The following provides an overview of our assets and operations in relation to certain of Marathon’s refineries:

December 31, 2018 | 5


Business

On October 1, 2018, Marathon completed its acquisition of Andeavor in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 29, 2018, as amended, under which MPC acquired Andeavor (the “MPC Merger”). Following the MPC Merger, Marathon was the beneficial owner of 156 million common units out of 245 million common units outstanding in the Partnership as of October 1, 2018, representing a 64% limited partner interest. Marathon is also the beneficial owner of 100% of the equity interests of TLGP.
Following the closing of the MPC Merger, Marathon announced that it had begun to evaluate our financial business plans with the intent to move toward financial policies that are more consistent with the approach Marathon uses for its other controlled master limited partnership, MPLX. Marathon announced that this approach includes meaningfully higher distribution coverage, leverage levels at or below 4.0x EBITDA, no planned public equity issuances and independent sustainability with limited parent support. Marathon has also previously disclosed that it is assessing strategic options for us and MPLX, which could include MPLX acquiring us or the Partnership acquiring MPLX.
2018 Acquisitions
2018 Drop Down
On August 6, 2018, we acquired Permian, refining logistics and asphalt assets (the “2018 Drop Down”) from our Sponsor. These assets include gathering, storage and transportation assets in the Permian Basin; legacy Western Refining assets and associated crude terminals; the majority of Andeavor’s remaining refining terminalling, transportation and storage assets; and equity method investments in ALRP, MPL and PNAC. In addition, the Conan Crude Oil Gathering System and the LARIP were transferred at cost plus incurred interest. In conjunction with the 2018 Drop Down, we entered into additional commercial agreements with our Sponsor. Refer to our discussion of the 2018 Drop Down, including financial details relating to the 2018 Drop Down, in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The 2018 Drop Down includes:

• | Crude oil and other feedstock storage tankage and refined product storage tankage at Marathon’s Mandan, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles refineries;


• | Rail terminals and truck racks at Marathon’s Mandan, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles refineries for the loading and unloading of various refined products from manifest and other railcars and trucks, respectively;


• | Interconnecting pipeline facilities in the Los Angeles area as well as other railroad tracks and adjoining lands;


• | Mesquite and Yucca truck unloading stations in New Mexico for the unloading of crude trucks and injection of crude into the TexNew Mex pipeline;

• | The Jal storage, injection and rail unloading facility in New Mexico that stores and supplies NGLs for use in Marathon’s El Paso refinery;


• | NGL storage tankage, a rail and truck terminal for the loading and unloading of natural gas liquids from railcars and trucks as well as from the waterline at the Wingate facility in New Mexico;


• | Crude oil and other feedstock storage tankage at the Clearbrook terminal in Minnesota;


• | Bobcat Pipeline that transports crude oil between the Mason East Station and the Wink Station;


• | Benny Pipeline that delivers crude oil from the Conan terminal in Texas to a connection with gathering lines in New Mexico;


• | All of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in: (i) Tesoro Great Plains Midstream LLC, which owns BakkenLink Pipeline LLC, (ii) Andeavor MPL Holdings LLC, which holds the investment in MPL, (iii) Andeavor Logistics CD LLC, (iv) Western Refining Conan Gathering, LLC, which owns the Conan Crude Oil Gathering System, (v) Western Refining Delaware Basin Storage, LLC, (vi) Asphalt Terminals LLC, which holds the investment in PNAC, and (vii) 67% of all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in ALRP; and


• | Certain related real property interests.

SLC Core Pipeline System
On May 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the SLC Core Pipeline System (formerly referred to as the Wamsutter Pipeline System) from Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. The system consists of pipelines that transport crude oil to another third-party pipeline system that supply Salt Lake City area refineries, including Marathon’s Salt Lake City refinery.

Commercial Agreements
Percentage of Affiliate and Third-Party Revenues by Operating Segment during 2018

(a) | Adjusted to include the historical results of the Predecessors. See Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.


(b) | The presentation of wholesale fuel sales was impacted by the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Beginning January 1, 2018, the revenues and costs associated with our fuel purchase and supply arrangements were netted.

Affiliates
Affiliates accounted for $1.6 billion, or 67%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with our Sponsor, under which we provide pipeline transportation, trucking, terminal distribution, storage services and coke handling services to our Sponsor. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our commercial agreements.
We process gas for certain producers under keep-whole processing agreements. Under a keep-whole arrangement, a producer transfers title to the processor the NGLs produced during gas processing, and in exchange, the processor delivers to the producer natural gas with a BTU content equivalent to the NGLs that would be removed. The nature of the transaction typically exposes the processor to commodity price risk. However, we maintain an agreement with our Sponsor that transfers the commodity price risk exposure associated with these keep-whole processing agreements to our Sponsor (the “Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement”). Under the Keep-Whole Commodity Agreement, our Sponsor pays us a fee in exchange for the NGLs, and delivers the replaced natural gas to the producers on our behalf. We pay our Sponsor a marketing fee in exchange for assuming the commodity risk. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our keep-whole agreements.
Third Parties
Third parties accounted for $791 million, or 33%, of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, we have available revolving lines of credit, an affiliate loan agreement with MPC (“MPC Loan Agreement”) and we may issue additional debt or equity securities for additional working capital or capital expenditures. See “Capital Resources and Liquidity” in Item 7 for additional information regarding working capital.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, neither we, nor our subsidiaries, directly employ any employees. The employees that conduct our business are directly employed by subsidiaries of Marathon. We had over 2,100 employees performing services for our operations as of December 31, 2018, approximately 245 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of these employees, approximately 6 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that was set to expire on January 31, 2019, and is under a rolling extension while the parties work toward a new agreement, approximately 125 under an agreement expiring January 31, 2022 and approximately 115 under an agreement expiring on February 28, 2023.

(a) | Our Petroleum Coke handling facility has capacity of 2,600 metric tons per day.


(b) | The pipeline mileage associated with our equity method investments is not included in the table. Our equity method investments are discussed below.

Our Terminalling and Transportation segment generates revenues by charging our customers fees for: 

• | providing storage services;


• | transporting refined products including asphalt;


• | delivering crude oil, refined products and intermediate feedstocks from vessels to refineries and terminals;


• | loading and unloading crude oil transported by unit train to Marathon’s Anacortes refinery;


• | loading and unloading from marine vessels and barges;


• | transferring refined products from terminals to trucks, barges, rail cars and pipelines;


• | providing ancillary services, ethanol blending and additive injection; and


• | handling petroleum coke for Marathon’s Los Angeles refinery.

Certain equity method investments that contribute to our Terminalling and Transportation segment include investments in:

• | MPL, which owns and operates an approximate 550 mile crude oil pipeline in Minnesota; and


• | PNAC, which owns and operates an asphalt terminal in Nevada.

We typically enter into long-term contractual arrangements with customers for the provision of services. Many of these contracts have minimum volume commitments that must be met by the customer over a period of time. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 92% of our total shell capacity is dedicated. These commitments and dedications provide our Terminalling and Transportation business with stable, fee-based cash flow limiting the impact of seasonality on our business. 

8 |


Business

Our Sponsor is our largest customer. We derived 92% of Terminalling and Transportation revenues from our Sponsor and its affiliates, most of which were derived from contracts that include minimum volume commitments, and have provided 57.7 million barrels of dedicated storage capacity for our Sponsor under various agreements.
Competition
Our competition primarily comes from independent terminal and pipeline companies, integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms. Competition in particular geographic areas is affected primarily by the volumes of refined products produced by refineries located in those areas, the availability of refined products and the cost of transportation to those areas from refineries located in other areas.
We may compete with third-party terminals for volumes in excess of minimum volume commitments under our commercial agreements with our Sponsor and third-party customers as other terminals and pipelines may be able to supply Marathon’s refineries or end user markets on a more competitive basis due to terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. If Marathon’s customers reduced their purchases of refined products from Marathon due to the increased availability of less expensive product from other suppliers or for other reasons, Marathon may only receive or deliver the minimum volumes through our terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not deliver the minimum volumes), which would decrease our revenues.
Safety
Terminal Safety
Terminal operations are subject to regulations under OSHA and comparable state and local regulations. Our terminal facilities are operated in a manner consistent with industry safe practices and standards. The storage tanks that are at our terminals are designed for crude oil and refined products and are equipped with appropriate controls that minimize emissions and promote safety. Our terminal facilities have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies. Our terminals are regulated under the Homeland Standards or Maritime Transportation Security Act, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities.
Pipeline Safety
Our pipelines, gathering systems and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. The transportation and storage of refined products, natural gas and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids or natural gas may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. The U.S. Department of Transportation, through the PHMSA and state agencies, enforces safety regulations governing the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations require the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the investigation of anomalies and, if necessary, corrective action. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans, including extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel.
We may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventative or mitigation measures associated with our pipelines. These costs and liabilities might relate to repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down our pipelines during such repairs. Additionally, if we fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to penalties and fines. If future PHMSA regulations impose new regulatory requirements on our assets, the costs associated with compliance could have a material effect on our operations.
While we operate and maintain our pipelines consistent with applicable regulatory and industry standards, we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, which could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to comply with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
Rail Safety
Our rail operations are limited to loading and unloading rail cars at our facilities. Generally, rail operations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. We believe our rail car loading and unloading operations meet or exceed all applicable regulations.

  Gathering and Processing
Our Gathering and Processing segment consists of the following assets and operations:

System | Location | Key Products Handled | Volume Source | Processing Throughput Capacity (MMcf/d) | Pipeline Mileage (b)
High Plains | MT, ND | Crude Oil | Marathon, Third-Party | — | | 1,119
Southwest | NM, TX | Crude Oil | Marathon, Third-Party | — | | 983 
North Dakota (a) | ND | Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Produced Water | Marathon, Third-Party | 170 | | 897 
Uinta Basin | CO, UT | Natural Gas | Marathon, Third-Party | 650 | | 631 
Green River (a) | UT, WY | Crude Oil, Natural Gas | Marathon, Third-Party | 850 | | 619 
Vermillion | CO, UT, WY | Natural Gas | Third-Party | 57 | | 482 
 | | | | 1,727 | | 4,731


(a) | We have a combined fractionation throughput capacity of 33.8 Mbpd at our Blacks Fork, Robinson Lake and Belfield complexes.


(b) | The pipeline mileage associated with our equity method investments is not included in the table. Our equity method investments are discussed below.

Our Gathering and Processing segment generates revenues by charging our customers fees for:

• | gathering and transporting crude oil, natural gas and produced water;


• | operating storage facilities with tanks located in strategic areas;


• | operating truck-based crude oil gathering; and


• | processing gas under fee-based processing, keep-whole and POP agreements.

Certain equity method investments that contribute to our Gathering and Processing systems including investments in:

• | ALRP, which operates a recently constructed 113 mile crude oil pipeline located in the Delaware and Midland basins in west Texas;


• | RGS, which operates the infrastructure that transports gas along 312 miles of pipeline from certain fields to several re-delivery points, including natural gas processing facilities that are owned by Andeavor Logistics or a third party;


• | TRG, which transports natural gas across 52 miles of pipeline to our natural gas processing facilities in the Uinta Basin; and


• | UBFS, which operates 79 miles of gathering pipeline and gas compression assets located in the southeastern Uinta Basin.

We derived 48% of Gathering and Processing revenues from our Sponsor and its affiliates. We process gas for certain producers under keep-whole processing agreements. Approximately 40% of our processing throughput capacity is currently supported by long-term, fee-based processing agreements with minimum volume commitments.
Our natural gas operations are affected by seasonal weather conditions and certain access restrictions imposed by the BLM on federal lands to protect migratory and breeding patterns of native species. During the winter months, our customers typically reduce drilling and completion activities due to adverse weather conditions. Also, access restrictions imposed by the BLM reduce our ability to complete expansion projects and connect to newly completed wells. We mitigate these seasonal risks in affected areas through prudent planning and coordination with our customers to ensure expansion projects are completed prior to these periods.
Competition
Our common carrier crude oil gathering and transport systems consists of our High Plains System and Southwest System, which gather and transport crude oil into major regional takeaway pipelines and refining centers, which compete with a number of transportation companies for gathering and transporting crude oil produced in the Bakken Region and the Delaware and Midland Basins, respectively. We may also compete for opportunities to build gathering lines from producers or other pipeline companies. Other companies have existing pipelines that are available to ship crude oil and continue to (or have announced their intent to) expand their pipeline systems in the Bakken Region and the Delaware and Midland Basins. We also compete with third-party carriers that deliver crude oil by truck.
Although we compete for third-party shipments of crude oil on our High Plains System and Southwest System, our contractual relationship with our Sponsor under our High Plains transportation services agreement (the “High Plains Pipeline Transportation 

10 |


Business

Services Agreement”), Southwest pipeline and gathering services agreement and our connection to Marathon’s refineries provide us a strong competitive position in the regions.
Our competitors for natural gas gathering and processing include other midstream companies and producers. Competition for natural gas volumes and processing is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, flexibility, access to markets, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. In addition to competing for crude oil and natural gas volumes, we face competition for customer markets, which is primarily based on the proximity of the pipelines to the markets, price and assurance of supply.
Safety
Our natural gas processing plants and operations are subject to safety regulations under OSHA and comparable state and local requirements. A number of our natural gas processing facilities are also subject to OSHA’s process safety management regulations and the EPA’s risk management plan requirements. Together, these regulations are designed to prevent or minimize the probability and consequences of an accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. A number of our facilities are also regulated under the Homeland Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities. Our natural gas processing plants and operations are operated in a manner consistent with industry safe practices and standards.
 Wholesale
Our Wholesale segment includes the operations of several bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of refined product delivery trucks that distribute commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. This business includes the operation of a fleet of finished products trucks that deliver a significant portion of the volumes sold by our Wholesale segment.
The Wholesale segment purchases petroleum fuels from our Sponsor’s refineries and from third-party suppliers. We have entered into a product supply agreement, as amended, with our Sponsor and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which our Sponsor has agreed to sell, and we have agreed to buy, between 90% and 110% of 79 Mbpd of our Sponsor’s refined products based upon forecasts provided each month by us. The products are purchased according to a predetermined formula based upon OPIS or Platts indices on the day of delivery and the applicable terminal location. Our Sponsor will provide us margin shortfall support for non-delivered rack sales. The product supply agreement contains customary payment terms that may be extended if our net working capital requirements grow significantly over time.
In addition to our sales to our Sponsor and certain of its affiliates, our principal customers are retail fuel distributors and the mining, construction, utility, manufacturing, transportation, aviation and agricultural industries. Our sales and services to our Sponsor accounted for 29% of our fuel sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018.
As part of this fuel distributions business, we have entered into a fuel distribution and supply agreement with our Sponsor. Under this arrangement, we are required to sell and deliver to our Sponsor, and our Sponsor is required to purchase and accept delivery from us, 21 Mbpd of branded and unbranded motor fuels to our Sponsor retail and cardlock locations in the Southwest U.S. In exchange for the sale and delivery of branded and unbranded motor fuels, our Sponsor will pay us an amount equal to our product cost at each terminal, plus applicable taxes and fees, actual transportation costs and a margin of $0.03 per gallon. In the event that our Sponsor fails to purchase the committed volume of branded and unbranded motor fuels, our Sponsor will pay $0.03 per gallon for each gallon below the committed volume. Our Sponsor will receive a credit for excess volumes purchased in subsequent months to the extent that shortfall payments were made in the prior twelve months. Our net cost per gallon will be determined based on the prices paid under the product supply agreement.
Competition
Our competition primarily comes from other wholesale petroleum products distributors on product sales pricing and distribution services in the Southwest U.S.
Rate and Other Regulations
General Interstate Regulation
Our High Plains System, Northwest Pipeline System, Southwest System and other interstate pipelines are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The FERC regulates interstate transportation on our crude oil transportation and gathering pipelines and Northwest Pipeline System under the ICA, the EPAct, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively, “Petroleum Pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory, and that we file such rates and terms and conditions of service with the FERC. Under 

December 31, 2018 | 11


Business

the ICA, shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services. The FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months, though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period. A successful rate challenge could result in Petroleum Pipelines paying refunds for the period that the rate was in effect and/or reparations for up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. There are no pending challenges or complaints regarding our current tariff rates.
Certain interstate Petroleum Pipeline rates in effect at the inception of the EPAct are deemed to be just and reasonable under the ICA. These rates are referred to as grandfathered rates. Our rates for interstate transportation service on the Northwest Pipeline System are grandfathered. The FERC allows for an annual rate change under its indexing methodology, which applies to transportation on our High Plains System and Northwest Pipeline System.
We own a natural gas pipeline in Wyoming. Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Federal regulation of interstate pipelines extends to such matters as rates, services, and terms and conditions of service; the types of services offered to customers; the certification and construction of new facilities; the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities; the maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business; the initiation and continuation of services; market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas; and participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements. The FERC prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. Under the NGA, the rates for service on interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. The FERC has granted the Rendezvous Pipeline market-based rate authority, subject to certain reporting requirements. If the FERC were to suspend Rendezvous Pipeline’s market-based rate authority, it could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with the transportation service.
Intrastate Regulation
The intrastate operations of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the NDPSC, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, the NMPRC and the TRC. Applicable state law requires that:

• | pipelines operate as common carriers;


• | access to transportation services and pipeline rates be non-discriminatory;


• | transported crude oil volumes be apportioned without unreasonable discrimination if more crude oil is offered for transportation than can be transported immediately; and


• | pipeline rates be just and reasonable.

Pipelines
We operate our crude oil gathering pipelines and the Northwest Pipeline System as common carriers pursuant to tariffs filed with the FERC, the NDPSC for the High Plains System, the NMPRC for the Four Corners System and the TRC and NMPRC for the Permian Basin System. The High Plains System offers tariffs from various locations in Montana and North Dakota to a variety of destinations, which are utilized by Marathon and various third parties. Our Sponsor has historically shipped the majority of the volumes transported on the High Plains System, which is expected to continue in 2019. The Northwest Pipeline System extends from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington and offers tariffs from various locations to a variety of destinations, which serves both third-party customers and Marathon. We have additional pipelines that provide gathering of condensate in Wyoming and other pipelines that provide crude oil gathering in North Dakota.
The FERC and state regulatory agencies generally have not investigated rates on their own initiative absent a protest or a complaint by a shipper. Our Sponsor has agreed not to contest our tariff rates for the term of our commercial agreements. However, our pipelines are common carrier pipelines, and we may be required to accept additional third-party shippers who wish to transport through our system. The FERC, NDPSC, NMPRC or TRC could investigate our rates at any time. If an interstate rate for service on our pipelines were investigated, the challenger would have to establish that there has been a substantial change since the enactment of the EPAct, in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the service that formed the basis for the rate. If our rates are investigated, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the FERC’s jurisdiction. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the FERC’s traditional tests to determine that they are gathering pipelines and are, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based regulation. Our natural gas and crude oil gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas or crude oil without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas or crude oil. Failure to comply 

12 |


Business

with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to our systems due to these regulations.
Environmental Regulations
General
Our operations of pipelines, terminals and associated facilities in connection with the storage and transportation of crude oil, refined products and biofuels as well as our operations of gathering, processing and associated facilities related to the movement of natural gas are subject to extensive and frequently-changing federal, state and local laws, regulations, permits and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern obtaining and maintaining construction and operating permits, the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid, liquid, salt water and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. These requirements may also significantly affect our customers’ operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, we do not expect such effects will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Under the Amended Omnibus Agreement and the Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement, Marathon indemnifies us for certain matters, including environmental, title and tax matters associated with the ownership of our assets at or before the closing of the Initial Offering and the subsequent acquisitions from our Sponsor. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding the Amended Omnibus Agreement and Carson Assets Indemnity Agreement.
Air Emissions and Climate Change Regulations
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. If regulations become more stringent, additional emission control technologies may be required to be installed at our facilities and our ability to secure future permits may become less certain. Any such future obligations could require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs.
The EPA has undertaken significant regulatory initiatives under authority of the Clean Air Act’s NSR/PSD program in an effort to further reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These regulatory initiatives have been targeted at industries with large manufacturing facilities that are significant sources of emissions, such as refining, paper and pulp, and electric power generating industries. The basic premise of these initiatives is the EPA’s assertion that many of these industrial establishments have modified or expanded their operations over time without complying with NSR/PSD regulations adopted by the EPA that require permits and new emission controls in connection with any significant facility modifications or expansions that can result in emission increases above certain thresholds. As part of this ongoing NSR/PSD regulatory initiative, the EPA has entered into consent decrees with several refiners, including Andeavor, that require the refiners to make significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment at selected facilities. However, we do not expect any additional requirements will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The EPA strengthened the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to 70 ppb in 2015 from the 75 ppb level set in 2008. To implement the revised ozone NAAQS, all states will need to review their existing air quality management infrastructure State Implementation Plan for ozone and ensure it is appropriate and adequate. Where areas remain in ozone non-attainment, or come into ozone non-attainment as a result of the revised NAAQS, it is likely that additional planning and control obligations will be required. States may impose additional emissions control requirements on stationary sources, changes in fuels specifications, and changes in fuels mix and mobile source emissions controls. The ongoing and potential future requirements imposed by states to meet the ozone NAAQS could have direct impacts on terminalling facilities through additional requirements and increased permitting costs, and could have indirect impacts through changing or decreasing fuel demand.
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 created RFS2 requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. The ongoing and increasing requirements for renewable fuels in RFS2 could reduce future demand for petroleum products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business, although it could increase demand for our ethanol and biodiesel fuel blending services at our truck loading racks.
Currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include actions to develop national, state or regional programs, each of which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions or those of Marathon and our other customers. The EPA amended in 2015 the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, to include among other things a new Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment, that encompasses greenhouse gas

emissions from equipment and sources within the petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting systems. In 2016, the EPA promulgated regulations regarding performance standards for methane emissions from new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities, and in September 2018, proposed targeted improvements to these standards to streamline implementation of the rules. These and other legislative regulatory measures will impose additional burdens on our business and those of Marathon and our other customers.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Regulations
To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, CERCLA, and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site.
Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites. Costs for these remedial actions, if any, as well as any related claims are all covered by indemnities from our Sponsor to the extent the release occurred or existed before the close of the Initial Offering and subsequent acquisitions from our Sponsor. The Partnership is not currently engaged in any CERCLA-related claims.
We also generate solid and liquid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the RCRA and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including wastes generated from the transportation and storage of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because the majority of our facilities operate as small quantity generators of hazardous wastes by the EPA and state regulations. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. The Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule of the EPA provides some additional flexibility for small generators but also increases certain recordkeeping and administrative burdens. Several states are now in the process of adopting this rule. Any additional changes in the regulations could increase our capital or operating costs.
We operate two salt water disposal wells located in North Dakota that are permitted under state regulations to accept produced water and fluids or waters from drilling and gas plant operations. These fluids are considered exempt from RCRA requirements per the E&P exemption. Changes to state or federal regulations regarding the E&P exemption or rules for the operation of disposal wells could impose additional burdens on our business.
We currently own and lease properties where crude oil, refined petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel additives, such as methyl tertiary butyl ether and ethanol, have been handled for many years by previous owners. At some facilities, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed or released wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including impacted groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination to the extent we are not indemnified for such matters.
Water Pollution Regulations
Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including chemical components of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined products. Many of our facilities operate near environmentally sensitive waters, where tanker, pipeline and other petroleum product transportation operations are regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions in some cases of the OPA 90, and in all cases to related state requirements. These requirements can subject owners of covered facilities to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. States in which we operate have also enacted similar, or in some cases, more stringent laws.
Regulations under the Clean Water Act, OPA 90 and state laws also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and state laws require containment to mitigate or

prevent contamination of waters in the event of a crude oil, natural gas, NGLs or refined products overflow, rupture, or leak from above ground pipelines and storage tanks. The Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at our facilities with above ground storage tanks and pipelines. In addition, OPA 90 requires that most oil transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. We maintain such plans, and where required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with OPA 90, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. Our crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product spill prevention plans and procedures are frequently reviewed and modified to prevent crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and refined product releases and to minimize potential impacts should a release occur. At our facilities adjacent to water, federally certified OSROs are available to respond to a spill on water from above ground storage tanks or pipelines. We have contracts in place to ensure support from the respective OSROs for spills in both open and inland waters.
The OSROs are capable of responding to a spill on water equal to the greatest volume of the largest above ground storage tank at our facilities. Those volumes range from 5,000 barrels to 125,000 barrels. The OSROs have the highest available rating and certification from the USCG and are required to annually demonstrate their response capability to the USCG and state agencies. The OSROs rated and certified to respond to open water spills (which include those OSROs with which we contract at our marine terminals that have received the highest available rating and certification from the USCG) must demonstrate the capability to recover up to 50,000 barrels of oil per day and store up to 100,000 barrels of recovered oil at any given time. The OSROs rated and certified to respond to inland spills must demonstrate the capability to recover up to 7,500 barrels of oil per day and store up to 15,000 barrels of recovered oil at any given time.
At each of our facilities, we maintain spill-response capability to mitigate the impact of a spill from our facilities until either an OSRO or other contracted service providers can deploy, and our Sponsor has entered into contracts with various parties to provide spill response services augmenting that capability, if required. Our spill response capability at our marine terminals meets the USCG and state requirements to either deploy on-water containment equipment two times the length of a vessel at our dock or have smaller vessels available. Our spill response capabilities at our other facilities meet applicable federal and state requirements. In addition, we contract with various spill-response specialists to ensure appropriate expertise is available for such contingencies. We believe these contracts provide the additional services necessary to meet or exceed all regulatory spill-response requirements.
The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. In certain locations, we contract with third parties for wastewater disposal. Our remaining facilities may have portions of their wastewater reclaimed by Marathon’s nearby refineries. In the event regulatory requirements change, or interpretations of current requirements change, and our facilities are required to undertake different wastewater management arrangements, we could incur substantial additional costs. The Clean Water Act and RCRA can both impose substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements and for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages resulting from such discharges. In addition, states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater.
Tribal Lands
Various federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of the Interior, along with certain Native American tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands where we operate. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources. For example, the EPA has established a preconstruction permitting program for new and modified minor sources throughout Indian country, and new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas in Indian country. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct, our gathering operations on such lands.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but substantially all of our customers’ natural gas and crude oil production requires hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions, but the EPA and other federal agencies have asserted federal regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process.
If additional levels of regulation and permits are required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines, which could reduce the volumes of crude oil and natural gas available to move through our gathering systems and processing facilities, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
