Our ability to grow the intrinsic value of our shares relies on deploying that capital prudently. We intend to be opportunistic with the allocation of our free cash flow and may pursue organic investments in priority markets, bolt-on and strategic acquisitions, as well as stockholder-friendly capital returns, such as share repurchases or dividends. Our investment decisions will be driven by comparing relative and absolute risk adjusted returns expectations.
Customers
Our businesses have diverse customer bases and sell products either directly to end-user customers or through intermediaries. We also have collaborative relationships with many OEMs and industry partners, who specify our chemistries and technologies for use in their products or grant us development rights to their intellectual property.
We believe that we are able to attract new customers successfully through our international reach, coupled with our local knowledge and on-the-ground presence, which enable us to meet the needs of our customers. We operate a relatively large number of small and medium-sized facilities located close to our customers throughout the world's major economic regions. This close proximity to our global customers' local sites enables access to all key growth markets and along with our efficient formulation process, allows for "just in time" supply chain management.
We believe that our businesses are not materially dependent upon any single customer, with no customer representing 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Due to the relatively short cycle times in the majority of our business, our order backlog levels are minimal.
Selling & Marketing 
We employ a customer-centric and highly-technical sales and marketing force worldwide. These professionals have technical expertise, local market knowledge and intimate customer relationships. Our local sales and marketing teams closely monitor their market trends and maintain active dialogue with our customers to assess and understand their constantly evolving challenges. We use this information from our local sales teams to anticipate future needs and respond rapidly to changing market conditions or technologies in order to deliver customized, value-added solutions to our customers. This feedback loop is an important source of new product ideas and helps guide our capital allocation decisions and research and development initiatives.
Our methods for selling and marketing our proprietary products vary slightly by geographic region. In total, we generate business through the efforts of regional sales, technical and service personnel, as well as distributors. In addition to regional sales and service staff, we maintain a group of global personnel focused on coordinating sales projects and obtaining design specifications for complex projects involving multiple customers within the manufacturing supply chain.
Human Capital Management
We strive to embody the five elements of our culture, our “5 Cs”: Challenge, Commit, Collaborate, Choose and Care. These core values are the foundation of our organization. We believe they reinforce our strategic objectives and empower our employees when serving and engaging with our customers globally.
At December 31, 2021, we employed over 5,300 full-time employees, of which approximately 40% are research and development chemists and experienced technical service and technical sales personnel. Our full-time employees are based throughout the world, with approximately 80% employed outside of the U.S. In certain countries where we operate, our employees are also members of unions or are represented by works councils. We believe our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining unions are satisfactory.
Talent Retention and Development. With our focus on innovation and service, key elements of our human capital strategy are the attraction, acquisition and engagement of highly skilled employees. Accordingly, we are committed to the continued development of our people and track internal KPIs related to career development and internal promotion. We offer many training opportunities to cultivate talent, improve targeted skills and facilitate internal mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce. In 2021, we introduced myESI, an internet-based human resources and career development portal, to provide our employees with empowering tools to drive their own career development. In addition, we regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions and segments to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. 
Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that an inclusive and diverse team drives innovation, which in turn allows us to compete effectively. To that end, we have policies designed to ensure fair hiring practices and prevent discrimination and harassment. To further emphasize the importance of these guiding principles, we provide diversity training on a targeted basis and solicit feedback through global employee surveys. In the U.S., our outreach and diversity recruiting efforts consist of targeted hiring initiatives, including job postings on platforms that appeal to potential minority candidates. We have short-term targets designed to increase diversity in our Company.
Health and Safety. As a chemical company, the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the safety of our employees. Accordingly, we have policies, safety programs and management systems to promote a healthy and safe workplace. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively developed and continue to implement Company-wide COVID-19 health and safety policies and procedures based on guidance from global health organizations, relevant governments and pandemic response best practices. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our business as well as our customers' and suppliers' businesses.
Social and Community Impact. We believe that building connections among our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. We understand that the best workforce comes from thriving communities, so we invest in our communities to support them. Through our engagement programs, our employees can connect to volunteering and giving opportunities. The ESI Foundation, which we funded in December 2020, serves as our charitable giving entity and provides monetary grants to qualified charitable organizations in the communities where our employees live and work. In 2021, as part of our ESI Cares initiative, we established a grant solicitation process for donations to charities and causes that are important to our employees and our communities. In addition, during 2021, many of our employees around the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting approximately 850 charitable organizations.
We communicate frequently with our employees through a variety of methods, including town hall meetings, our Company intranet and emails. To evaluate our employee experience and retention efforts, we conduct global employee culture surveys. We also survey our customers to gauge customer satisfaction and expectations.
Research and Development
Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Continued investment in research and development ensures that we remain ahead of emerging trends and continue to strengthen our strong positions in our market niches. Our research and development activities are also focused on developing products and improving formulations and processes that respond to or anticipate customers' changing needs and that we expect will drive growth or otherwise add value to both our core business operations and customers. We accelerate market introductions and increase the impact of our local product offerings through collaboration with partners in the academic and commercial sectors (customers and value-chain partners) and by working with customers and OEMs on tailored application development around the world through our technical service teams. We plan to continue making meaningful investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. 
Our commitment to technological innovation and extensive intellectual property portfolio enables us to develop differentiated products at the forefront of technological advances. Research resulting in new, proprietary formulations is performed principally in Germany, United Kingdom, India, Singapore, and the United States. During 2021, our research and development expenses totaled $49.7 million. Substantially all research and development activity was performed internally.
Competitive Environment
Our markets are competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. Our businesses compete in markets for specialty chemicals for electronic applications, general metal and plastic finishing, offshore oil and gas exploration and production, and consumer packaging.
Our businesses compete primarily on the basis of quality, technology, performance, reliability, brand, reputation, service, range of products and services and support. We maintain extensive technical support and testing services for our customers and are continuously developing new products to meet their needs. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us across several business areas. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to promoting and selling certain products. We believe, however, that our ability to manufacture, sell, service and develop new products and applications, enable us to compete successfully. Some large competitors operate globally, as we do, but most operate only locally or regionally. We also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete.
The specific competitive environment of each of our segments is described below:
Electronics
Our Electronics segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly competes within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc., DuPont de Nemours, Inc., Henkel Corporation, Senju Metal Industry Co. and Uyemura International.
Industrial & Specialty
Our Industrial & Specialty segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly competes within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc., DuPont de Nemours, Inc., BP p.l.c., Miraclon Corp. and Flint Group.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our businesses formulate a broad range of specialty chemicals, which we create by blending raw materials and incorporating them into multi-step technological processes. Our global operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We typically purchase our major raw materials as-needed from outside sources and we work closely with these suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. As part of our sustainability efforts, we recycle certain raw materials, primarily tin, in our own smelting and refining facility in the U.S. for further use in our manufacturing process. The majority of the raw materials we use are, in most cases, obtainable from multiple conformant sources worldwide.
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Products
We maintain an extensive intellectual property portfolio, which we developed or acquired over a number of years. This portfolio includes a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in major markets and other commercially-relevant jurisdictions worldwide. Although we believe the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in our businesses, we also rely on the innovative skills, technical competence and selling abilities of our personnel.
We regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development. At December 31, 2021, we owned, had applications pending, or licensed the rights to, approximately 2,600 domestic and foreign patents, which have remaining lives of varying duration. Although certain of these patents are important to our business, no specific group or groups of intellectual property rights are material, and we have many proprietary products which are not covered by patents.
We also rely on confidentiality agreements and patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law as well as judicial enforcement to protect our technologies, processes, product composition, formulations and other intellectual property rights. In addition, we implement confidentiality procedures, contractual exclusivity and other rights necessary to protect our proprietary intellectual property, formulations, processes and other product-related rights. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements, when applicable, with our employees, consultants, contractors and other third-parties who may be engaged in 
discovery or development of intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Finally, we seek to include provisions in our material transfer agreements, license and development agreements and other agreements that provide for the transfer of intellectual property rights back to us to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances of any specific transaction and development project.
Government Regulations
As a global manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals, our operations are, or may in the future be, subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters (or SH&E requirements), including product safety, worker health and safety and environmental protection matters, such as discharges of pollutants, the management, handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. 
Compliance with SH&E requirements has not had, and in the future is currently not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. However, current governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety, such as chemical composition, packaging and labeling, and environmental protection, such as the management, movement and disposal of hazardous substances, are resulting in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. In addition, as climate change and other ESG-related treaties, initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we expect that this trend of increased regulation will continue in the future and there can be no assurance that future material capital expenditures or incremental operating expenses will not be required in order to ensure compliance.
We may in the future incur significant costs, including cleanup costs for contaminated sites and related fines or penalties, and face third-party claims for property or natural resource damage or personal injuries relating to past or future violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations. We believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, and consider that the liabilities we recorded at December 31, 2021 for our various environmental matters were appropriate.
