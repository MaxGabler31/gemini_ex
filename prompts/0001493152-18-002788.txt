ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
THE COMPANY
 
Westwater Resources, Inc. is an energy minerals exploration and development company. We presently hold exploration properties with lithium and uranium exploration potential, a uranium development property in the Republic of Turkey, as well as idled uranium production properties. We were organized in 1977 to acquire and develop uranium projects in South Texas using the ISR process. Near term uranium production potential is now centered on our Temrezli ISR project in Turkey. WWR also controls extensive exploration properties in Turkey under eight exploration and operating licenses covering approximately 39,000 acres with numerous exploration targets in Turkey, including the potential satellite Sefaatli project, which is 30 miles southwest of the Temrezli project. We have historically produced uranium by ISR methods in the state of Texas where we currently have ISR projects and two licensed processing facilities. We also have approximately 188,700 acres of mineral holdings in the prolific Grants Mineral Belt of the state of New Mexico, and 11,000 acres in the South Texas uranium province. WWR acquired these properties over the past 25 years along with an extensive information database of historic drill-hole logs and analysis. WWR ceased uranium production in 2009 and none of WWR’s properties are currently in production. As of March 1, 2018, we had 30 employees.
 
During 2016 and 2017, we developed a lithium focus with dominant land positions in highly prospective basins in Nevada and Utah. Our focus is on developing low cost lithium brines.
 
OUR STRATEGY
 
Our vision is to become the leading developer and producer of energy minerals, particularly lithium and uranium. Our strategy is to build value for stockholders by advancing our projects towards production when economics allow, while prudently managing our cash and liquidity position for financial flexibility. Our lithium business in Nevada and Utah involves exploration for low cost brine resources with the intent of developing them for production. In Turkey, our focus is on advancing near-term production of the Temrezli project with construction for the project anticipated to begin when the uranium market improves, which is expected to occur in the next two to five years, subject to the receipt of permits, land access and project financing. Our Rosita processing facility in South Texas may be used in the development of the Temrezli project as we plan on relocating key components of the Rosita processing facility from Texas to Turkey for use at the Temrezli project. In Texas, our focus is on fulfilling our environmental obligations with proactive restoration of legacy wellfields while maintaining our processing facilities on standby for potential operating/processing agreements. In New Mexico, we continue to assess the potential for the development of our larger scale projects on a stand-alone basis or with partners. At any time we may have acquisition or partnering opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, analysis of technical, financial and other confidential information, submissions of indications of interest, participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes.
 
Our pipeline of projects is prioritized as near-term, mid-term and long-term projects with a goal of achieving sustainable production over time with both lithium and uranium projects so as to take advantage of rising and/or high price environments for both of these minerals. Amidst the prevailing low uranium price environment, we continue to balance cash conservation with maintaining readiness to fast track resumption of production at such time as uranium prices show sufficient improvement. We continually adjust near-term and long-term business priorities in accordance with market conditions.
 
RECENT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
 
Agreement to Acquire Alabama Graphite
 
On December 13, 2017, the Company entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Alabama Graphite Corp. (“Alabama Graphite”) in an all-stock acquisition. Upon completion of the acquisition, former Alabama Graphite shareholders would own approximately 29.4% of the outstanding shares of the combined company based on the number of WWR and Alabama Graphite common shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. The Westwater Board of Directors expects the acquisition to provide significant strategic and financial benefits to the Company’s stockholders, including participation in the value chain of critical minerals for the high growth battery market, operational efficiencies and improved access to capital. Closing of the acquisition remains subject to various conditions, including approval by AGC’s and the Company’s respective stockholders and approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

Lithium Business Expansion
 
On June 20, 2017, the Company acquired its third lithium exploration project, through the staking of 9,270 acres of federal placer mining claims within the Railroad Valley of central Nevada. The Railroad Valley Project is located approximately 75 miles west of Ely, Nevada.
Columbus Basin Data Review and Exploration Drilling
 
On April 5, 2017, the Company announced that its independent geophysical consultant has completed the review, integration and reinterpretation of historical geophysical survey data acquired by the Company and covering its Columbus Basin lithium brine exploration project in Nevada. Among other things, the results of the work indicated that the depth of the Columbus Salt Marsh basin is greater than previously anticipated and identified certain targets for lithium brine exploration. In July 2017, the Company began a Phase-1 exploration drilling program at the Columbus Basin project.
 
On October 31, 2017, the Company announced that it has completed the Phase 1 exploration project at this project and reported the following results:
 

● | Three core holes were completed for a total of 3,870 ft. of drilling. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The maximum drilled depth was 1,680 ft. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fluids with high total dissolved solids (TDS) were identified in all three holes. 


● | In-house laboratory work performed at its Kingsville, Texas facility returned lithium concentrations of up to 43 parts per million (ppm) and boron concentrations of up to 173 ppm. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Planning is underway for a Phase 2 exploration program at the Project. As part of the Phase 2 program, Westwater has filed a Notice of Intent to drill in the Nina claim block and is evaluating the Phase 1 results and the results of drilling by Caeneus Minerals Ltd. on nearby lithium properties.
 
Sal Rica Exploration Planning
 
A brine sampling program at the Sal Rica Project was designed and implemented to infill previous shallow aquifer sampling completed by Mesa Exploration Corp. in 2016. The resultant combination of the new Westwater data and the existing Mesa Exploration Corp. data now provide shallow aquifer lithium concentration data on variable 1 to 2 mile centers, depending on site accessibility, across the entirety of the 13,260 acre project area.
 
In addition to the recent groundwater sampling event, Westwater has also completed new geophysical interpretations of the Sal Rica project area. This data is being integrated into a conceptual model of the exploration target, and will guide the ongoing planning of a drilling and hydrogeologic characterization program to further expand and define the shallow, lithium bearing, brine aquifer. So far this work has outlined a strong lithium brine anomaly that covers an area of over twenty (20) square miles, with lithium values up to 100 ppm, all at shallow depths.
 
Westwater has commenced the permitting process with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), and the State of Utah, to field an exploration program that optimizes project access and limits environmental disturbance, minimizes cost, and maximizes overall data quality.
 
Option Agreement for Lithium Brine Claims
 
On March 24, 2017, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Lithium Holdings Nevada LLC entered into an option agreement to purchase a block of unpatented placer mining claims covering an area of approximately 3,000 acres within the Columbus Salt Marsh area of Esmeralda County, Nevada. The claims adjoin a portion of the Company’s current property holdings at its Columbus Basin project, expanding the project area within the basin to approximately 14,200 acres. The Company has the right to conduct exploration activities on the claims during the one-year option period. Under the option agreement, the Company may acquire the mineral property claims on or before March 24, 2018 in exchange for 200,000 shares of WWR common stock and a 1% net smelter return royalty on the claims.

OVERVIEW OF THE LITHIUM INDUSTRY
 
The primary use for lithium is a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries for electronic devices and electric vehicles. Lithium ion batteries, as they are known, have been adopted as the standard method of powering electronic devices such as smart phones and small, portable computers for some time, but it is the transportation market that is expected to drive growth for the next decade. Growth in consumption of lithium is expected to average over 6% annually between now and 2025, according to CRU International Limited, with the transportation sector accounting for much of this growth. This major component is expected to rise from 20% to 39% of total demand over the next seven years.
 
At the same time, lithium prices have risen in response to increased demand. Lithium carbonate is one form used for battery manufacturing, and prices have risen from $5,792 per metric ton in 2016 to $7,300 per metric ton in just over a year. For lithium hydroxide, a second form of the material, prices have risen from $6,974 per metric ton to over $23,000 per metric ton during the same period.
 
Our lithium business objectives are to discover and produce lithium from lithium salts hosted in brines. This production method is typically the lowest cost type of lithium production. While the technologies are well known in some respects, it takes time for deposits to be discovered and developed, which should result in a supply deficit over the next few years. Expected higher prices will encourage investment in the sector and bring new sources of production online over time. CRU International Limited expects long term lithium prices to stabilize at approximately $6,400 per metric ton and $9,400 per metric ton for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, respectively. These are considerably higher than the historic prices for these products.
 
Westwater is targeting exploration and development of lithium brines because they are characteristically in the lowest operating cost quartile of production, and would be more likely to be profitable in the markets described above.
 
OVERVIEW OF THE URANIUM INDUSTRY
 
The only significant commercial use for uranium is as a fuel for nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity. According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), as of January 2017, there were 448 nuclear reactors operable worldwide, up from 441 the prior year. Annual requirements for uranium amount to about 138 million pounds of uranium. Thirty countries utilized nuclear power in 2017. In addition, the WNA lists 61 reactors under construction, 164 being planned and 347 being proposed.
 
While global nuclear power generation is expected to drive increased demand through 2030, especially in China, Russia, India and South Korea, UxC Consulting projects continued oversupply and low uncovered demand over the near-to-medium term due to higher inventory levels at utilities. During 2017, term contracting was weak and focused on shorter period mid-term contracts. This restrained the spot market as discretionary buying was also weak. UxC projects that global nuclear power generation will expand to 518 reactors in 36 countries by 2030.
 
Worldwide uranium production or primary supply in 2017 is estimated by UxC Consulting in its Q4 2017 report at 151 million pounds of U3O8. This is compared with 160 million pounds of primary supply in 2016. Total production in 2017 is expected to total 139 million pounds. The reduction is primarily due to the suspension of Cameco’s majority-owned McArthur River/Key Lake project in Canada and a cutback at New AREVA’s SOMAIR project in Niger.
 
Spot prices rose from $21.00 per pound in January 2005 to a high of $136.00 per pound in June 2007 in anticipation of sharply higher projected demand as a result of a resurgence in nuclear power and the depletion or unavailability of secondary supplies. The sharp price increase was driven in part by high levels of buying by utility companies, which resulted in most utilities covering their requirements through 2009. A decrease in near-term utility demand coupled with rising levels of supplies from producers and traders led to downward pressure on uranium prices since the third quarter of 2007. A rebound in uranium prices in conjunction with a recovery in commodities in 2010 was curtailed by the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.
 

11
--

 

In 2017, the average weekly spot price of uranium was $22.06 per pound compared with $26.42 in 2016 and $36.83 per pound in 2015. In 2017, the weekly spot price of uranium reached a high of $26.50 per pound in February and again in December while the low for the year was $19.25 per pound in May. The year end 2017 spot price was $23.75 per pound.
 
Some analysts project that uranium prices may have bottomed and expect gradually recovering uranium prices from a supply deficit as uranium market fundamentals for supply and demand improve over time. Secondary supply inventories continue to weigh on the uranium market in the near term but are expected to reduce from depleted government inventories and a rebalancing of the enrichment sector, according to UxC. Demand for uranium is expected to improve from an increase of nuclear power generation in China and other countries.
 
COMPETITION
 
There is global competition for lithium and uranium properties, capital, customers and the employment and retention of qualified personnel. We compete with multiple exploration companies for both properties as well as skilled personnel. In the production and marketing of lithium and uranium, there are a number of producing entities globally, some of which are government controlled and several of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Several of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than we have.
 
Our future uranium production will also compete with uranium from secondary supplies, including the sale of uranium inventory held by the U.S. Department of Energy. In addition, there are numerous entities in the market that compete with us for properties and operate ISR facilities. If we are unable to successfully compete for properties, capital, customers or employees or with alternative uranium sources, it could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
With respect to sales of lithium and uranium, the Company competes primarily based on price. We will market lithium directly to users of the product, and uranium to utilities and commodity brokers. We are in direct competition with supplies available from various sources worldwide. We believe we compete with multiple lithium exploration and development companies, as well as operating uranium companies.
 
OVERVIEW OF WESTWATER RESOURCES’ PROJECTS
 
Lithium Exploration Targets
 
During 2016, we commenced with a program to acquire and explore lithium-enriched brine targets in the western United States. As a consequence of our in-house geological reconnaissance program we identified three prospective project areas for which we have acquired mineral rights: the Columbus Basin project in western Nevada, the Railroad Valley project in east-central Nevada and the Sal Rica Project in northwestern Utah.
Columbus Basin Project
 
Our Columbus Basin project is located in western Nevada and is comprised of two blocks of unpatented placer claims that we staked in July and September of 2016. These claims, which are owned by the Company, cover portions of a closed drainage basin that has geological characteristics that may be permissive for hosting lithium-enriched brines. Our exploration efforts on the project thus far have included reconnaissance-scale and detailed geochemical sampling, and the completion of three exploration drill holes. The Columbus Basin project encompasses approximately 14,200 acres, split into two significant blocks of federal placer mineral claims, and a third contiguous block for which rights were acquired through an option to purchase.
Railroad Valley Project
 
The Railroad Valley project is located in east-central Nevada, approximately 60 miles southwest of the town of Ely and 240 miles southeast of the city of Reno. The Railroad Valley, which is one of the largest closed basins in the State of Nevada, is also the site of the largest oil production in Nevada. Westwater Resources staff carried out extensive geochemical sampling within the Railroad Valley drainage basin and identified an area on the western flank of the basin that is host to a strong and wide-spread zone of anomalous lithium values hosted in basin-fill sediments. The Railroad Valley project encompasses approximately 9,270 acres of federal placer mineral claims.

12
--

Sal Rica Project
 
Our Sal Rica project is situated in the area of a closed drainage basin that was once part of the Great Salt Lake/Lake Bonneville area of western Utah. We hold a large group of unpatented placer claims that we acquired in part from Mesa Exploration and other placer claims that we staked in 2016. The project area was explored previously by Quintana Petroleum for potash-enriched brines, and as part of their shallow drilling program they identified anomalous levels of lithium-enriched brines at depths of less than 50 feet from the surface. Our activities at the Sal Rica project thus far have been limited to geologic reconnaissance and geochemical characterization sampling. The Sal Rica project encompasses approximately 13,260 acres of federal placer mineral claims.
Uranium Projects
 
Turkey
 
In Turkey, WWR controls extensive exploration properties under eight exploration and operating licenses covering approximately 39,000 acres with numerous exploration targets, including the potential satellite Sefaatli project, which is 30 miles southwest of the Temrezli project. The project area enjoys year-round accessibility via paved roads and a number of gravel tracks and trails. Sparsely populated, but with access to major infrastructure such as water and power, the area is gently undulating. The majority of the project area is owned by local families who work the land for grain production.
Temrezli Project.
 
The Temrezli project is wholly owned and operated by Westwater, and was acquired by the Company from Anatolia Energy Limited (“Anatolia”) in 2015. The Company holds three (3) operating licenses encompassing approximately 6,850 acres. The Temrezli project is situated in central Turkey, approximately 150 miles east of the national capital of Ankara. Uranium mineralization was first discovered in the area of the project by the Uranium Division of Turkey’s General Directorate of Mineral Research & Exploration (“MTA”) of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in the early 1980s. MTA continued to explore the region for the next 10 years. Following a change to the Turkish Mining Law in 2004 the private sector has been able to explore for radioactive substances. Anatolia Energy, through its subsidiary Adur Madencilik Ltd. commenced exploration at the Temrezli project in 2010 and using its extensive technological experience and expertise, re-evaluated and confirmed the MTA’s findings. The uranium mineralization is considered to be epigenetic and related to strata controlled redox boundaries influenced by permeability changes and/or strata bound reductants such as disseminated organic materials in fine grained rocks and iron sulfides.
 
After extensive analysis and other technical work, Anatolia released a preliminary feasibility study in February 2015 indicating cash operating costs of $16.89 per pound U3O8 and all-in operating costs of approximately $30.17 per pound U3O8. Technical work continues to refine the work plan for our properties in the Republic of Turkey at the field location and in our offices there, as well as our office in Denver.
 
Şefaatli Project.
 
The Şefaatli project area contains the region’s second most significant occurrence of uranium mineralization. In Şefaatli area, the Company was granted with 2 exploration licenses and 1 operation license covering an area of approximately 25,100 acres. The Şefaatli project is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the Temrezli project.
 
Texas
 
In Texas, WWR has the Kingsville Dome and Rosita licensed processing facilities and approximately 11,000 acres of prospective ISR projects and historical production assets. These wellfields and the processing facilities are on standby for a restart of production when there is a sustained improvement in the uranium market.
 
Key operational elements of WWR’s plan for its Texas properties include (1) positioning the Company to return to sustainable production by continuing to evaluate potential brownfield and greenfield exploration opportunities and evaluating synergistic opportunities from existing resources held by other entities; and (2) continuing reclamation activities in South Texas in accordance with the Company’s existing agreements and regulatory requirements.
 

13
--

New Mexico
 
In New Mexico, the Company controls minerals rights encompassing approximately 188,700 acres in the west-central part of the State. WWR holds substantial non-reserve mineralized material at its properties in the prolific Grants Mineral Belt in New Mexico, which holds one of the largest known concentrations of sandstone-hosted uranium deposits in the world.
THE ISR PROCESS
 
The ISR process is dramatically different from conventional mining techniques. The ISR technique avoids the movement and milling of significant quantities of rock and ore and also avoids the creation of mill tailing waste associated with more traditional mining methods. It is generally more cost-effective and environmentally sensitive than conventional mining and processing. Historically, the majority of U.S. uranium production resulted from either open pit surface mines or underground mining.
 
The ISR process was initially developed for the production of uranium in the mid-1960s, and was first utilized at a commercial-scale project in South Texas in 1975. It became a routinely utilized recovery method in the South Texas uranium district by the late 1970s, where it was employed in about twenty commercial projects, including two operated by us.
 
In the ISR process, groundwater fortified with oxygen and carbon dioxide is pumped into a permeable ore body within a wellfield, causing the uranium contained in the ore to dissolve. A wellfield consists of a series of injection wells, production (extraction) wells and monitoring wells drilled in specified patterns. Wellfield pattern is crucial to minimizing costs and maximizing efficiencies of production. The resulting solutions from the wellfields are pumped to the surface, where the uranium-bearing water is circulated through an ion exchange column, and uranium is precipitated from the fluid onto resin beads. The uranium-depleted fluid is then re-injected into the subsurface uranium deposit. When the ion exchange column’s resin beads are loaded with uranium, they are removed and flushed with a salt-water solution, which liberates the uranium from the beads. This process results in uranium residing in a slurry, which is then dried and packaged for shipment as a uranium concentrate. In order to achieve greater operating efficiencies and reducing capital expenditures when developing new wellfields, we employ a wellfield- specific remote ion exchange process as opposed to a central processing plant, as we had done historically. Instead of piping the solutions over long distances through large diameter pipelines, and mixing the waters of several wellfields together, each wellfield is produced using a dedicated satellite ion exchange facility. This allows ion exchange to take place at the wellfield instead of at the central plant. The satellite facilities allow recovery of uranium from each wellfield using its own native groundwater, thus avoiding the introduction of foreign mineral complexes and the attendant complications of doing so.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PERMITTING
 
United States
 
Uranium and lithium extraction is regulated by the federal government, states and, in some cases, by Indian tribes. Compliance with such regulation has a material effect on the economics of our operations and the timing of project development. Our primary regulatory costs have been related to obtaining licenses and permits from federal and state agencies before the commencement of production activities, as well as the cost for maintaining compliance with licenses and permits once they have been issued. The current environmental and technical regulatory requirements for the ISR industry are well established. Many ISR projects have gone a full life cycle without any significant environmental impact. However, the regulatory process can make permitting difficult and timing unpredictable.
 
U.S. regulations pertaining to ISR mining continually evolve in the U.S. However, at this time we do not anticipate any adverse impact from these regulations that would be unique to our operations.
 
Radioactive Material License
 
Before commencing ISR operations in Texas and either ISR or conventional mining activity in New Mexico, we must obtain a radioactive material license. Under the federal Atomic Energy Act, the NRC has primary jurisdiction over the issuance of a radioactive material license. However, the Atomic Energy Act also allows for states with regulatory programs deemed satisfactory by NRC to take primary responsibility for issuing the radioactive material license. NRC has ceded jurisdiction for such licenses to Texas, but not to New Mexico. Such ceding of jurisdiction by NRC is hereinafter referred to as the “granting of primacy.”

14
--

 

The Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) is the administrative agency with jurisdiction in Texas over the radioactive material license. For operations in New Mexico, radioactive material licensing is handled directly by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
 
See Item 2, “Properties” for the status of our radioactive material license for Texas.
 
Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Permits
 
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act creates a nationwide regulatory program protecting groundwater. This law is administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). However, to avoid the burden of dual federal and state regulation, the Safe Drinking Water Act allows for the UIC permits issued by states to satisfy the UIC permit required under the Safe Drinking Water Act under two conditions. First, the state’s program must have been granted primacy. Second, the EPA must have granted, upon request by the state, an aquifer exemption. The EPA may delay or decline to process the state’s application if the EPA questions the state’s jurisdiction over the ISR site.
 
Texas has been granted primacy for its UIC programs, and the TCEQ administers UIC permits. The TCEQ also regulates air quality and surface deposition or discharge of treated wastewater associated with the ISR process.
 
New Mexico has also been granted primacy for its UIC program. Properties located in “Indian Country,” as that term is defined in federal law, remain subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA. Some of our properties are located in areas that some alleged to be in Indian Country. The Navajo Nation has been determined eligible for treatment as a state, but it has not requested the grant of primacy from the EPA for uranium related UIC activity. Until the Navajo Nation has been granted primacy, ISR activities that may fall within Indian Country will require a UIC permit from the EPA. Despite some procedural differences, the substantive technical requirements of the Texas, New Mexico and EPA underground injection control programs are very similar.
 
See Item 2, “Properties” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” for a description of the status of our UIC permits in Texas and New Mexico.
 
Mining Permits
 
All uranium producing states have regulations governing the development licensing or permitting, operation and closure of conventional and in-situ recovery mines. In New Mexico, the Mining and Minerals Division of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department is responsible for issuing permits under the authority of the New Mexico Mining Act of 1978. Well established regulations specify what information is necessary to support mine permit applications and set forth a well-defined application review process. The primary focus of the agency’s review is to ensure that the proposed mine will protect the environment surrounding the mine area, comply with relevant environmental standards, and be reclaimed to a self-sustaining ecosystem or other approved post-mine land use. Application reviews require consultation with other state agencies, public notice and public hearing opportunities. In addition to mine permits, a discharge permit must be obtained from the New Mexico Environmental Department for mine facilities such as ore pads, waste rock piles and tailings impoundments.
 
In Texas, the TCEQ regulates uranium mining and issues the necessary license and permits. URI holds a radioactive material license which covers the Kingsville Dome, Rosita and Vasquez sites, and that license is in timely renewal. Each site has operated under a class III injection permit also issued by the TCEQ. Rosita and Vasquez permits have both been renewed in 2014. The Kingsville mining permit application was withdrawn, without prejudice to refiling, in June 2016. For additional discussion on the withdrawn permit, see Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, below. Within each area’s permit, the TCEQ also issues production area authorizations (“PAAs”). Kingsville holds three PAAs, Rosita holds four PAAs, and Vasquez holds two PAAs. Each site also has class I non-hazardous injection permits for operation of waste disposal wells on site, which are regulated by the TCEQ as well. All permits for the disposal wells are active. The disposal well permit for Kingsville is undergoing the renewal process. In addition to the required state permits, the EPA regulates the underground aquifers and requires areas with uranium mineralization to have that portion of the aquifer exempted before state mining permits are issued. The aquifer exemptions for all three Texas sites have been issued.
 
Other
 
In addition to radioactive material licenses and UIC permits, we are also required to obtain from governmental authorities a number of other permits or exemptions, such as for laboratory glassware, wastewater discharge, for land application of treated wastewater, and air emissions.

In order for a licensee to receive final release from further radioactive material license obligations after all of its ISR and post-production reclamation have been completed, approval must be issued by the TCEQ for Texas properties along with concurrence from NRC and for properties in New Mexico by the NRC.
 
In addition to the costs and responsibilities associated with obtaining and maintaining permits and the regulation of production activities, we are subject to environmental laws, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund or CERCLA, and regulations applicable to the ownership and operation of real property in general, including, but not limited to, the potential responsibility for the activities of prior owners and operators.
 
Reclamation and Restoration Costs and Bonding Requirements
 
At the conclusion of ISR or conventional mining, a site is decommissioned and reclaimed, and each well field is restored. Restoration involves returning the aquifer to its pre-development use. Restoration can be accomplished by flushing the ore zone with native ground water and/or using reverse osmosis to remove ions, minerals and salts to provide clean water for reinjection to flush the ore zone. Reclamation involves removing evidence of surface disturbance. Decommissioning and reclamation entails dismantling and removing the structures, equipment and materials used at the site during the ISR and restoration activities.
 
The Company is required by the regulatory agencies in the State of Texas to obtain financial surety relating to certain of its future restoration and reclamation obligations. The Company has provided performance bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the amount of $9.1 million to satisfy such regulatory requirements. The performance bonds relate primarily to our operations at our Kingsville Dome and Vasquez projects.
 
In February 2013, the Company secured a new source to satisfy its financial surety obligations for the Texas regulatory agencies. Previously, the Company had met its financial surety obligations through a combination of bank issued letters of credit (the “LOCs”) and bonds issued for the benefit of the Company. These financial surety arrangements required the Company to fully collateralize the face amount of the LOC’s and the bonds with short term investment vehicles. This requirement resulted in the Company posting $9.1 million in cash that was restricted for the purpose of collateralizing these obligations. The Company’s new financial surety arrangements are provided by Lexon Insurance Company (“Lexon”) in the form of bonds issued for the benefit of the Company. The amount of the bonds written by Lexon total approximately $9.1 million and the collateral requirements of these bonds require the Company to maintain 40% of the value of the bonds in the form of restricted cash.
 
We estimate that our restoration and reclamation liabilities for prior operations at the Kingsville Dome, Vasquez and Rosita sites as of December 31, 2017, are about $7.5 million, with a carrying value of $5.7 million recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.
 
The Company’s financial surety obligations are reviewed and revised periodically by the Texas regulatory agencies. In New Mexico surety bonding will be required before commencement of uranium recovery operations and will be subject to annual review and revision by NRC and the State of New Mexico or the EPA.
 
Lithium-enriched brines
 
Lithium-enriched brines on public lands, which are managed by either the U.S. Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service, in Nevada and Utah can be acquired by staking placer mining claims. Production of lithium-enriched brines in Nevada is regulated in part by the Nevada Division of Water Resources as brine is considered to be a water resource and the Nevada Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation, as well as by the relevant federal land management agency in a manner similar to the requirements for a hard-rock mine.
 
Water Rights
 
Water is essential to the ISR process. It is readily available in South Texas. In Texas, water is subject to capture and we do not have to acquire water rights through a state administrative process. In New Mexico, water rights are administered through the New Mexico State Engineer and can be subject to Indian tribal jurisdictional claims. Also in New Mexico, new water rights or changes in purpose or place of use or points of diversion of existing water rights, such as those in the San Juan and Gallup Basins where our properties are located, must be obtained by permit from the State Engineer. Applications may be approved subject to conditions that govern exercise of the water rights.

Water rights are also an essential component for the production of lithium from brine sources. In the case of Nevada, application for water rights must be submitted to the Division of Water Rights, a state agency that holds responsibility for administration of surface and ground water in the state. The state has a well-established process for application to acquire water rights and protection of existing water rights. As is the case in most of the western states, Nevada’s water rights administration includes the evaluation of applications for new water rights, the availability of groundwater within a specific locality, point(s) of diversion and use of granted water rights for beneficial use. The State of Utah has a similar water right application and administration processes, managed under the Utah Division of Water Rights.
 
Republic of Turkey
 
Mining Law
 
The mining industry in Turkey is regulated by the 1985 Turkish Mining Law (Law No 3213), which was amended most recently in February 2015 (“Amended Mining Law”) and regulations issued thereunder. Mining rights and minerals are exclusively owned by the state. The ownership of minerals in Turkey is not subject to the ownership of the relevant land. The government of Turkey, under the 1985 Mining Law, as amended, delegates its right to explore and operate to individuals or legal entities by issuing licenses for a determined period of time in return for the payment of a royalty. The governmental body with responsibility for implementing the 1985 Mining Law and issuing the license and permits is the General Directorate of Mining Affairs (“MIGEM”) under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. The Amended Mining Law distinguishes five groups of minerals. Pursuant to this classification the royalty amount to be paid to the state differs. Uranium mining is listed under Group 4-ç. The three types of licenses granted for prospecting and operating mines under the laws of Turkey are an exploration license, an operation license and an operation permit.
Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (“TAEK”)
 
Projects that involve radioactive materials are regulated and controlled by TAEK. TAEK was established by Law No. 2690 to exercise the functions assigned to it by this law. ISR mining of uranium is included in these functions by Article 4(b). For projects to be considered as a nuclear facility and for operation, several licenses are required from TAEK. The licensing process moves parallel to the Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) procedure. TAEK must accept a licensee as project owner in accordance with the law. Once accepted as an owner, a licensee must obtain a site license, a construction license and an operation license to operate.
Institutional Framework for Environmental Management
 
The lead government agency with responsibility for environmental protection in Turkey is the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning (“MEUP”). MEUP has a coordinating role in the development and enforcement of environmental policies in Turkey. MEUP is also responsible for EIA approvals for projects.
Permits Required Prior to Construction
 
These permits include the Environmental Impact Assessment (from MEUP), the certification as project owner of a nuclear facility (from TAEK), a mine operating permit (from MIGEM), a site license (from TAEK), a construction license (from TAEK), land access agreements or an expropriation decision and infrastructural permits to construct power, access road, water supply well, etc.
Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) Permit
 
The Turkish EIA permitting process can be initiated with the submission of the EIA Application Document (the “AD”) to MEUP. Once the submission is made, the AD is checked by MEUP for compliance with the mandatory AD format and the EIA regulation. If the AD is found suitable, then it is distributed to the EIA Review and Assessment Committee (“RAC”) (made up of representatives of various governmental agencies) and the date of the official Public Meeting is determined. Following MEUP’s review the AD becomes public. The date and place of the hearing is then announced in at least one local and one national newspaper. Following the public hearing, the RAC members upload their comments about the project to the electronic permitting system and the mandatory Terms of Reference (“ToR”) for the EIA report is provided by MEUP following the payment of the EIA permitting fee by the project owner. Once the mandatory ToR is received from MEUP, the project owner and its consultant are allowed a maximum of 18 months to complete the draft EIA report for RAC’s review.
 
Once a draft comprehensive EIA report is submitted to the MEUP the draft EIA report is checked by MEUP for compliance with the ToR and the EIA regulation. The report is reproduced and distributed to the RAC, and the RAC meeting date is decided. At this stage, the draft EIA report is open to written public comments. Based on the RAC’s decision and consideration of the public comments, the EIA permitting process is given either a “Positive” or “Negative” decision (i.e., the impacts are found acceptable or not). The EIA permitting process is finalized by the Minister’s signature.

Mine Operating Permit
 
A mine operating permit must be obtained after all the permits are received prior to construction. Application will be made to MIGEM requesting the operating permit which is in line with the operating license. MIGEM will issue the permit after reviewing the application document. This permit will require an affirmative EIA certificate (or a certificate stating that an EIA is not required), land ownership permits, and the workplace opening and operation licenses. The operating permit must be obtained within three years from the effective date of the operating license. If the operating permit is not obtained within three years from the effective date of the operating license, the operating license can be maintained by additional payments that may be characterized as penalties. Operational activities must be started within one year following the operating permit date. The royalties paid to the government will also be initiated by the operating permit.
Project Owner of a Nuclear Facility
 
According to TAEK, the judicial entities who intend to build and operate a nuclear installation must apply to the TAEK to be recognized as owner. After the recognition of owner, any financial or administrative change in owner’s structure must be notified to TAEK in 30 days.
Site License
 
Once recognized as an owner, a licensee will prepare the Site Report in order to get the Site License from TAEK. The Site Report is prepared in parallel to the EIA Report. However, the review and approval of the report will be done once the affirmative EIA decision is obtained from MEUP.
 
The Site Report is submitted to TAEK and the decision is released to the applicant by TAEK. An affirmative notification is deemed a site license. The conditions of the license are given to the applicant as an appendix to the license. Following the receipt of the site license, licensee can proceed with the work related to site preparation, potable water supply and electricity supply, access road, and office building construction etc.
 
Construction License
 
The initial application will be submitted to TAEK with the Preliminary Safety Analysis Report. Following the assessment of the Preliminary Safety Analysis Report the Nuclear Safety Department of TAEK prepares a limited work permit evaluation report which also includes the view of the Committee. When it is established that the protection measures are adequate and that the facility can operate without harming the safety and the health of the public, the Commission will issue the limited work permit. The limited work permit requires that the construction starts in 12 months from the date of affirmative decision, otherwise the permit is lost. This period may be extended if valid reasons are submitted to TAEK.
 
The comments obtained during the evaluation of the Preliminary Safety Analysis Report will be incorporated into the Final Safety Analysis Report. Once this report is accepted and finalized, then the affirmative notification is issued as the construction license.
 
Land Access
 
The project area is located in privately owned agricultural lands. Surface access to these lands must be either purchased or leased from the owners. If an agreement cannot be reached, then the licensee can initiate an expropriation process. In addition, in order to use these lands in mining, the land use must be changed from agriculture to mining. This procedure requires a “Public Benefit Decision” be obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Livestock. As a part of the procedure, a site visit will be conducted by the local department of various ministries.
 
Turkish Law 3213 specifies voluntary land acquisition. This is the preferred method of land acquisition. If it is demonstrated that it will not work, then the licensee can proceed with the expropriation process. An affirmative EIA decision is a prerequisite to initiate the process. The governmental body in charge of expropriation process is the Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources (“ETKB”), and more specifically the MIGEM. Application will be made to ETKB.

Infrastructural Permits
 
Several permits will be required from various offices. These permits include access road permits which are obtained from the Provincial Government and the Department of Transportation, permits for the electricity transmission lines which are handled through the local electricity authority, permits for drilling and installing a water supply well which must be obtained from the State Hydraulic Works (“DSI”) and a domestic water treatment plant must be approved by MEUP prior to installation.
Permits Required Prior to Operation
 
During the construction period, the operational period permitting documentation and applications will be made. Prior to starting the operation, the permits required include the Trial Environmental Permit, a workplace operating license, a hazardous waste storage permit and the Operating License (from TAEK).
 
Operating License from TAEK
 
At least six months before the start of commissioning of plant components and systems, the applicant, who was granted a construction license, must apply to TAEK for a commissioning permit. Following the evaluation of documents, TAEK may grant the commissioning permit.
