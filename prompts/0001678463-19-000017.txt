Item 1. Business
On March 13, 2015, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P. (which is referred to, along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding us and other companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity, as Lone Star) acquired the building products business of HeidelbergCement AG in the United States and Eastern Canada, or the Acquisition. Unless otherwise specified or where the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “our,” “we,” “us,” the “Company” and “our business” (i) for the Predecessor periods prior to the completion of the Acquisition, refer to the building products business of HeidelbergCement AG in the United States and Eastern Canada, (ii) for the Successor periods after completion of the Acquisition, but prior to the internal reorganization transaction discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in which LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd transferred its building products business in the United States and Eastern Canada to Forterra, Inc., or the Reorganization, the building products business of LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd in the United States and Eastern Canada and (iii) for the Successor periods after completion of the Reorganization, the operations of Forterra, Inc., in each case together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware in 2016. We are controlled by Lone Star and have a relatively short operating history as a stand-alone company. 
General
We are a manufacturer of pipe and precast products in the United States and Eastern Canada for a variety of water-related infrastructure applications, including water transmission, distribution and drainage. 
Our manufacturing and distribution network allows us to serve most major United States and Eastern Canadian markets. We operate 79 manufacturing facilities and currently have additional manufacturing capacity available in both of our segments, providing room to increase production to meet short-cycle demand with minimal incremental investment. These facilities and our distribution network provide us with a local presence and the necessary proximity to our customers to minimize delivery time and distribution costs.
We manufacture both water drainage pipe and precast structures (used primarily for storm water and drainage applications) and water transmission and distribution pipe (used primarily to transport potable water and as a component of wastewater systems) and believe our complementary product portfolio is well positioned to serve both the storm water and wastewater infrastructure market and the potable water transmission and distribution market. We believe that our exposure to each of the residential, non-residential and infrastructure end-markets will allow us to benefit from both secular and cyclical growth across each of these end-markets. The residential, non-residential and infrastructure end markets in the United States and Eastern Canada have different growth drivers and operating dynamics, and the cyclical performance of these markets has historically been staggered during different stages of the broader economic cycle.
Our organic growth strategy is focused on leveraging our operations, customer service and product innovation capabilities, as well as our product breadth and scale, to sell our products to existing customers, to increase penetration and project wins and to gain market share through new customers. Operationally, we continue to focus on efficiency and productivity improvements to reduce costs and drive margin improvements. We continuously evaluate our existing business and acquisition opportunities to complement our organic growth or enhance our scale, geographic footprint and product portfolio while simultaneously considering and making strategic divestitures or changes in our manufacturing footprint to optimize our portfolio. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our recent acquisitions and divestitures.

Our Segments
Drainage Pipe & Products. We are the largest producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products by sales volume in the United States and Eastern Canada. We operate 60 manufacturing facilities across multiple states and a Canadian province. We believe our product offering creates value for our customers as it eliminates the need to engage multiple suppliers of storm water and wastewater-related products for a single project, permitting them to maximize efficiency and meet more aggressive timetables. We also have the ability to custom-build products to complex specifications and regulations. 
Water Pipe & Products. We are the largest producer of ductile iron pipe, or DIP, by sales volume in the United States, and we produce concrete pressure pipe in Eastern Canada. Our product breadth and depth and our technical service address a range of our customers' water transmission and distribution needs. Our 19 manufacturing facilities are located across the United States and Eastern Canada, with swing capacity available to support increased production levels as appropriate to satisfy increased demand.

Our Industry and Core End Markets
We serve a range of infrastructure-related end markets. Based on the source of funding, we classify these construction markets into infrastructure, residential and non-residential.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure represents spending by federal, state, and local governments for the construction of streets, highways and storm and sanitary sewers often supported by multi-year federal and state legislation and programs. In December 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, or the FAST Act, was enacted by the United States federal government, authorizing funding from $43 billion in fiscal 2016 to $47 billion in fiscal 2020 to upgrade transportation-related infrastructure. The rate at which spending under the FAST Act or other governmental infrastructure programs will occur is driven by a number of factors, including demographic and population shifts, availability of state funds (including matching funds), and the ability of contractors to obtain skilled labor.
Residential Construction
Residential construction includes single family homes and multi-family units such as apartments and condominiums. Demand for residential construction is influenced by demographic and population shifts, mortgage interest rates, and the ability of builders to obtain skilled labor. In 2018, total annual housing starts in the United States increased to 1.2 million, an increase of 3.6% above 2017 housing starts. 
2
Non-residential Construction
Non-residential construction includes all privately financed construction other than residential structures. Revenues in this end-market are driven largely by new United States non-residential construction, for which demand is generally driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The supply of non-residential construction projects is also affected by the availability and cost of funding. 
Our Products
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
We manufacture drainage pipe and precast products in the United States and Eastern Canada. Drainage pipe has residential, non-residential and infrastructure applications. It is primarily used for storm water applications, such as storm drains for roads and highways, and for residential and non-residential site developments. In addition, drainage pipe is used for sanitary sewers, low-pressure sewer force mains, tunneled systems, treatment plant piping and utility tunnels.
Drainage pipe consists of concrete reinforced by a steel cage. It is manufactured by producing a steel mesh cage, enclosing it in a form or mold and then pouring concrete around it to produce the pipe. Drainage pipe is manufactured in round, elliptical and arch shapes ranging from 12 inches to 144 inches in diameter and in box sizes ranging from three feet to 15 feet in length and width. We also manufacture a wide variety of precast concrete products, including box culverts, utility vaults, manholes, drainage inlets and pipe end sections. These precast concrete products are used for applications such as roadway drainage, airport drainage, storm water management, utility construction and water treatment and filtration systems. Our range of precast concrete products also includes products that fall under the general description of specialty precast, including products for which we hold patents that make us the exclusive manufacturer or which are manufactured under license agreements with third parties. These specialty products include architectural panels for buildings, modular railroad crossings, retaining wall systems, highway noise barriers, storm water treatment systems and concrete vaults, which are used to house either dry utilities (such as electrical, data or communications equipment) or wet utilities (such as valves, pumps or water meters).
We also manufacture structural precast products in the United States and manufacture a range of precast concrete bridge girders for highway projects in both the United States and Eastern Canada. We manufacture a variety of structural precast products primarily for infrastructure and non-residential applications, including hollow-core planks, prestressed bridge girders, beams, columns, wall panels, stairs, garage floors and architectural cladding. These products are used as structural and architectural elements in building structures such as parking garages and arched and modular bridges.
Precast concrete products are reinforced with steel, similar to pipe, and manufactured using either a dry cast or wet cast concrete mix, depending on the size of the piece and the number of identical pieces to be manufactured. In the dry cast method, a concrete mix with low water content, known as zero-slump concrete, is poured into a mold and then densely compacted around the steel reinforcement using a variety of manufacturing methods. The concrete structure is immediately removed from the mold and allowed to cure in a high humidity environment to ensure proper hydration of the concrete. This method allows multiple pieces to be produced from the same mold each day and is most suitable for high volume, repetitive manufacturing. In the wet cast method, a concrete mix with relatively high water content is poured into a mold and allowed to cure in the mold, which can take from four to 12 hours. Precast concrete products typically range in diameter from four to 12 feet for round products or in length and width from one foot to 12 feet for square or rectangular products.
We also regularly consider ways to innovate internally and expand our drainage pipe and precast product offerings by working to bring other products to market. Some of our product offerings include Kenner Chainwall, Duct Bank, and a number of storm water innovative technologies for storm water management marketed through our Bio Clean subsidiary. Kenner Chainwall is a precast concrete foundation that provides a structurally sound, on-grade or elevated foundation to support prefabricated shelters or equipment buildings. One use is to elevate 
3
electrical equipment in flood zones such as those devastated by hurricanes. Duct Bank is a precast product that consolidates and protects underground electrical and communication cables and can be used in the construction of large buildings as well as installing cabling underneath roads and areas with existing structures. Each of these products is now commercially available. 
In addition to our operations, we have a 50% equity interest in Concrete Pipe & Precast LLC, or CP&P, a joint venture with Americast, Inc. CP&P operates 12 plants that serve the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. CP&P manufactures drainage pipe and precast concrete products and sells those products to similar types of customers as the ones to which we market. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding CP&P.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
Utilizing the U.S. Pipe and Forterra Pressure Pipe Canada brands, we manufacture a number of products used for the transmission of potable water and wastewater in pipe diameters ranging from three to 174 inches.
We manufacture DIP in pipe diameters ranging from three to 64 inches in the United States. For each diameter of pipe we offer a wide range of thicknesses with both standard and specialized linings and coatings. DIP is used for transmission and distribution of potable water and wastewater and is typically utilized for smaller diameter applications of 24 inches and smaller. DIP has residential and infrastructure repair replacement applications, including potable water distribution systems, small water system grids, major water transmission mains, wastewater collection systems, sewer force mains and water treatment plants. In addition to DIP, we also manufacture a full line of complementary joint restraints and fittings in Mexico, which are utilized for interlocking adjoining segments of pipe and are typically bundled with DIP. We also operate fabrication plants that modify our pipe to meet specific customer design requirements for above-ground applications.
DIP is manufactured using a process that consists of introducing molten iron into a rapidly-rotating steel mold and relying on centrifugal force to distribute the molten iron evenly around the inner surface of the mold to produce pipe of uniform size and dimensions. We also strive to innovate in our Water Pipe & Products segment, including by offering metallic zinc coating and TR-XTREME pipe. Metallic zinc coating is active corrosion protection for DIP. TR-XTREME pipe is DIP designed for areas of seismic activity and has joints that provide flexible extension capabilities.
In addition, for larger diameter applications, we manufacture concrete pressure pipe, prestressed concrete pipe and bar-wrapped concrete pipe in Eastern Canada. Our concrete pressure pipe is used for water transmission and distribution, power plant cooling water lines, sewage force mains for wastewater and storm water and other diverse applications involving the movement of large volumes of water. Concrete-lined pressure pipe ranges from ten to 144 inches in diameter. Prestressed concrete pipe consists of a concrete core, a steel cylinder and a high tensile strength wire that is wrapped, under measured tension and at uniform spacing, around the steel cylinder. This wire wrap places the steel cylinder and concrete core in compression, developing the pipe’s ability to withstand specified hydrostatic pressures and external loads. An outside coating of mortar protects the wires. Bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe combines the physical strength of steel with the structural and protective properties of high strength cement mortar. In this type of pipe, a round steel bar is helically wound around a welded steel cylinder and all surfaces are encased in cement mortar. This composite pipe reacts as a unit when resisting internal pressure and external loads. The inside of the cylinder is lined with centrifugally cast cement mortar.
Our concrete pressure pipe is highly engineered and is built to order for technically demanding applications requiring various thresholds of working pressure, surge pressure and loads. Our engineers work closely with customers to design components and systems to meet specific regulatory and industrial demands.

Customers and Markets
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
We typically sell our drainage pipe and precast products to contractors that perform construction work for various levels of government, residential and non-residential building owners, and developers in markets across the United States and Eastern Canada. Additionally, although they are not our direct customers, we view the owners and engineers who are customers of the contractors that purchase our products as our customers as well, because these owners and engineers often specify the types of products that our customers are required to use. We also sell our drainage pipe and precast products to utility companies. Several of our largest manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to our markets. Our drainage pipe and precast products are typically shipped within a radius of 150 miles, but in some cases up to 350 miles, from our manufacturing facilities.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
Our water transmission pipe products are sold to some of the largest waterworks distributors and contractors. Our Water Pipe & Products segment has significant sales through distributors, including Core & Main, a key customer that accounted for 14% and 13% of our consolidated net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We also sell to utility contractors that work on new or replacement pipeline projects, primarily in the East, South and Midwest of the United States and in Eastern Canada. Our pressure pipe is used in projects for regional water authorities and districts, cities, counties, municipalities, port authorities, private companies and industrial clients, including power plants. DIP is shipped within a radius of over 1,000 miles and concrete pressure pipe is typically shipped within a radius of 500 miles from our manufacturing facilities.
Competition
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
Our largest competitors in our Drainage Pipe & Products Segment include Rinker Materials (a division of the QUIKRETE Companies) and Oldcastle Infrastructure (a unit of CRH plc). We also compete with many regional and local manufacturers. Additionally, our drainage pipe products compete with high density polyethylene, or HDPE, and polypropylene pipe products where such materials would serve as an appropriate substitute for our product.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
Our two largest competitors in DIP manufacturing are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. Our DIP products also compete with polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, and HDPE pipe. Our national network of fabrication products competes with regional and local providers of those products and services.
Within Canada, our concrete pressure pipe products compete with DECAST (formerly Munro Concrete Products, Ltd.) and several other American and Canadian competitors. Our concrete-lined pressure pipe also competes with pressure pipe made from other materials such as fiberglass, HDPE and PVC.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Our products are generally made to order, but certain of our products are made to inventory. We have established target levels of inventory for certain products that we attempt to keep available at our manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand. Inventories are held at manufacturing facilities and, to a lesser extent, at distribution yards.
Our structural precast products, most precast concrete products and concrete pressure pipe are customized products that are made to order. Our order backlog for precast concrete products is typically two to six months. Our order backlog for concrete pressure pipe and other precast offerings (bridge products) is approximately eight months.
5
We seek to attract and retain customers through customer service and technical expertise, as well as product quality, our product and service offerings and competitive pricing. Our market strategy for products with non-residential end users is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships rather than traditional advertising.
We maintain in-house technical sales, engineering and field service teams which provide customers technical expertise and support to assist them in finding the right product or solution for their specific need. Each of our operating segments has its own sales force. Overall, we employ more than 330 sales and related support professionals. Our sales force and customer service functions are staffed by experienced professionals who have been trained in our product lines, processes and systems, and who maintain touch points with engineers, contractors, builders, and distributors. Additionally, we have a staff of approximately 70 engineers that we employ to work in concert with our sales force to help develop effective product solutions for our customers. 
We sell our DIP products and our fittings and fabricated products primarily through distributors. Our drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and precast concrete products are sold direct to customers who are installing such products for or are the end users of such products. Drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and certain precast products are sold through a bidding process in which we seek to place the most competitive bid. We undertake marketing efforts through our participation in trade shows and through our website. We outsource many of our product deliveries by using a combination of dedicated carriers and other third-party carriers.
Raw Materials and Inputs
The primary material for our drainage pipe and precast concrete products and our concrete pressure pipe is concrete, which consists of water, cement, aggregates. Another key input for our products is steel, which is used to provide reinforcement within our drainage pipe and precast concrete products. Our DIP is largely made from iron melted from recycled scrap metals. Other key materials for our DIP include foundry coke and certain additives, such as silica.
Most of our raw materials are widely available commodities. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials. To the extent we do not produce any raw materials, when and where possible, we try to purchase raw materials from the source, and because of their low value-to-weight ratios, we generally try to source our raw materials in the vicinity of our facilities. We usually purchase the raw materials we need in the spot market, except where we anticipate a significant need of materials for a specific project. Other than certain contracts for key materials, including cement and steel, we typically do not enter into long-term supply contracts with our suppliers that require us to purchase particular quantities or to pay particular prices. In our project-based businesses, we may pass certain raw material costs to end users through step-up mechanisms included in our price quotes tied to the timing of execution.
As part of the Acquisition, we entered into a Cement Supply Agreement with Lehigh Cement Company, LLC, or Lehigh, a subsidiary of HeidelbergCement AG, or, together with its affiliates, HeidelbergCement, which requires us to purchase our cement requirements from Lehigh for five of our existing manufacturing facilities in the United States through March of 2020. The Cement Supply Agreement allows us to obtain competing price quotations from other suppliers and gives Lehigh an opportunity to match those prices or release us from our purchase obligation for the facility or facilities in question for the period of the competing price quotation. 
We purchase our steel from a number of different suppliers, but most suppliers are based in the United States in order to comply with “Buy America” government contract requirements placed on our customers. We endeavor to purchase these steel supplies from the entity which is as close as possible to the manufacturer.
To manufacture DIP, fabricated products and fittings, we purchase scrap metal directly from qualified scrap sources near our foundry sites in the United States and Mexico. We utilize certain categories of scrap metal, primarily shredded automobile bodies, plate & structural, and cast iron. We purchase foundry coke from two of the four merchant coke producers in the United States, both located in Birmingham, Alabama. Major alloys and additives are procured from both domestic and foreign sources based on a semiannual bid process.

See Notes 3, 14, and 23 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these divestitures and dispositions, as applicable.
Seasonality
The construction industry, and therefore demand for our products, is typically seasonal and dependent on weather conditions, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. For a more detailed discussion, see the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the seasonality of our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 4,672 employees, 1,317 of which were salaried and 3,355 of which were hourly. Of the total number of employees, 4,108 were located in the United States, 321 were located in Canada and 243 were located in Mexico. The number of hourly workers we employ varies to match our labor needs during periods of fluctuating demand and varies seasonally in certain regions. We also employ temporary workers as needed to meet production goals.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 32% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 42% of these employees are included in collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year of December 31, 2018. We have not had any recent union-organized work stoppages in the United States, Canada or Mexico. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees and with the unions representing our employees.
Intellectual Property
We own various United States and foreign patents, registered trademarks, trade names and trade secrets and applications for, or licenses in respect of, the same, that relate to our various business lines including a number of innovative technologies relating to storm water management. While the name Forterra is relatively new 
8
in our industry, we believe our customers reacted favorably to the new name and rebranding effort that followed the Acquisition. The U.S. Pipe name has been a recognized manufacturer of DIP for more than 115 years. We also license intellectual property for use in certain of our products from unaffiliated third parties. We believe that our patents, trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are adequately protected and that any expiration or other loss of one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations governing health and safety or the protection of the environment and natural resources, including, for example:

• | the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the generation, handling, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of waste from our operations;


• | the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws that govern the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations which we have sent waste for disposal;


• | the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws and regulations that can impose detailed permit requirements and strict controls on discharges of waste water from our facilities; and


• | the federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions, including federal and state laws and regulations to address greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions.

Environmental pre-construction and operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. It is likely that we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws. It is also likely that we will be required to make additional expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters such as pollution controls, on an ongoing basis. As our operations involve, and have involved, the handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as, toxic or hazardous or otherwise as pollutants, there is some risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the materials and products we handle and transport. Consequently, we are subject to environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances. We are also subject to a variety of health and safety laws and regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Manufacturing sites can be inherently dangerous workplaces. Our sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials and there is inherent risk of related liabilities in our operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted, and new laws that we anticipate will be adopted that could affect our operations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, published a final rule in March 2016 decreasing the levels of crystalline silica dust exposure to which workers can be exposed. We are in compliance of the new OSHA rules. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases, including silicosis, and several scientific organizations and some states, such as California, have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer. OSHA has established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust. We monitor occupational exposures at our facilities and implement dust control procedures and/or make available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels.
9
Despite our compliance efforts, risk of environmental, health and safety liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that environmental, health and safety liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.
Our consolidated financial statements include estimated liabilities for future costs arising from environmental issues relating to our properties and operations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued environmental liabilities of approximately $1.6 million. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
We have been named as a potentially responsible party, or PRP, at sites identified by the EPA or state regulatory agencies for investigation and remediation under CERCLA, or comparable state statutes, generally referred to as Superfund sites, including Sylacauga, AL, North Birmingham, AL, Portland, OR and Chattanooga, TN. With respect to these Superfund sites for which we have received PRP notices, we are entitled to contractual indemnity by a third party, subject to the terms of the indemnity provisions contained in the relevant agreement. Our estimates of current liabilities factor in these indemnification rights and our assessment of the likelihood that the indemnitor will fulfill its obligations with respect to liabilities relating to such sites. To date, the indemnifying party has been fulfilling its indemnification obligation with respect to those Superfund sites, and we have no reason to believe it will not continue to do so. However, in the future, we can provide no assurance that the indemnifying party will continue to honor its obligations, or that the existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover the liabilities for such matters.
