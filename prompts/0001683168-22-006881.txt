Business Overview
 
Wearable Health Solutions
 
Wearable Health Solutions Inc. (the Company) was incorporated as Medical Alarm Concepts Holding, Inc. on June 4, 2008, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring all of the membership units of Medical Alarm Concepts LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company (“Medical LLC”). On May 26, 2016, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change its name from “Medical Alarm Concepts, Inc.” to “Wearable Health Solutions, Inc.”
 
Wearable Health Solutions provides mobile health (mHealth) products and services to a significant number of dealers and distributors throughout the globe (Canada, United States and New Zealand, Bermuda). As a provider of personal emergency response devices, in the rapidly growing medical alarm device and eHealth sector, we provide innovative wearable healthcare products, tracking services, and turn-key solutions that enable our users to be proactive with their health, as well as safe and protected. According to the QYResearch report on Global PERS devices, MediPendant was the 17th largest global PERS company based on revenues in 2021 (“QYResearch Global PERs Devices Market Report, History and Forecast 2016-2027”). Our products and services are always state-of-the-art and cost effective. Through our culture, our drive, and the expertise of each individual employee, we are uniquely positioned to build shareholder value by setting the highest standards in service, reliability, and safety in our rapidly growing industry.
 
Our flagship products are the iHelp devices, MediPendant®, the iHelp+ 3G™, the iHelp Mini 4G™, and the next generation iHelp MAX 4G™ - personal emergency alarms that are used to summon help in the event of an emergency at home. As of 2021, approximately 60% of all medical alarms being sold globally, by sales revenue (or approx. 57% of volume by type), are either Landline type or Standalone type technologies that require the user to speak and listen through a central base station unit, according to the QYResearch report on PERS (“QYResearch Global PERs Devices Market Report, History and Forecast 2016-2027”). The MediPendant®, however, offers a product that, is always connected through a landline, and has the speaker in the pendant, enabling the user to simply speak and listen directly through the pendant in the event of an emergency.
 
The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs for the next fiscal year and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has a net loss of $13,049,155, and if the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
 
During the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, Company has net cash used in operating activities of $(3,107,177) as well as stock compensation non-cash expenses of $10,044,522 and a net loss of $13,049,155. The Company raised $2,380,252 from financing activities, net of repayments, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, which resulted in a negative working capital of $(2,133,878) as of June 30, 2022. If the Company is unable to raise additional adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

On August 2, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Voice of Things, Inc., in order to embed voice control into the devices. This agreement will provide the Company with cloud-to-cloud integration between Voice of Things, Inc. and iHelp without requiring any device-level touchpoints. The voice activation feature will be implemented at an estimated cost of $36,000 and has an approximate integration timeframe of two months, excluding certification time. This solution will also our products to integrate and function with Alexa/Google smart speakers and their respective apps. The voice control software has been completed as of February, 2022; however, the Company is currently in the design phase of the medical alert device that the software will be implemented in. The production of that medical device was supposed to be completed in early 2022, however, due to factory shutdown, supply chain issues as well as some minor changes to the medical alert device. The Company has now begun to receive the medical alert devices as of the latter part of September, 2022.
 
On August 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase and Advisory Services Agreement (“Agreement”) with Anthony Chetta, owner of mHealth, whereby the Company acquired ownership of mHealth.com, the user portal used by the subsidiary customers, all code and related operations, the domain name, and logos, data, storage and online operations for $50,000. The Company is treating this transaction as an asset acquisition under ASC 505-50, with preliminary purchase allocation to the asset, the website and coding. As of February 2022, the Company is in the process of obtaining an independent valuation of the asset. The Company also retained Mr. Chetta as the Chief Technology Advisor, by issuing 1,000,000 restricted shares as a stock signing bonus, valued at $10,500 or $0.0105 per share, issued on September 30, 2021, $8,000 per month service agreement, and 1,000,000 shares of common stock every 6 months for a 30 month period, valued at $52,500 or $0.0105 per share. By acquiring mHealth the Company now owns its backend portal system which integrates and controls how our dealers interact with our customers, invoicing, and device functionality, which should allow the Company to better control and improve on the services it provides.
 
All of our products are used in conjunction with our proprietary management and operation platform. The platform is a cloud-hosted service consisting of methods and automation tasks for accepting data transmission from personal safety and medical devices (“PS/M”) and storing, reformatting, and retransmitting this data to subscribers, monitoring centers, healthcare providers, front-end portal/user interfaces, and API controllers.
 
The front-end portal interface provides a friendly, intuitive, and seamless management and monitoring platform for all of the below listed integrations, coupled with PS/M device fulfillment, tracking, controlling, and remote reprogramming, along with portal user administration and role/privilege assignment, internal activity/audit trails, ordering and invoicing, support portal integration, and any other customizations needed based on solution requirements.

The iHelp MAX™ device, will operate on 4G Networks, is anticipated along with our platform to be able to plug into multiple devices to enable remote monitoring and data collection of essential vital signs in real-time with historical data via Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi technology, thereby making our devices telehealth ready. WHSI is considering several wearable technology vendors to produce and implement body-mounted sensors, such as smart watches, heart monitors, blood pressure sensors that can monitor and transmit biological data for healthcare purposes. At this time, the Company has not entered into any agreements, is only in preliminary discussions and there is no guarantee that we will come to an agreement with any of these vendors. If we do not come to an agreement with these vendors, we do not foresee that as materially affecting our business as there are multiple vendors and manufacturers of these type of products already in the industry.
 
The company recently launched the iHelp Mini 4G™, a small, lightweight, 4G device that includes features and functions such as fall detection, Geo-fencing, medication reminders, GPS, and SOS alerts. Currently the company has sold over 600 devices to dealers and consumers and is expecting an additional 1000 devices delivered shortly.
 
We anticipate the launch of the iHelp MAX™ device in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 which offers a customized lone worker program for use with the iHelp MAX™. The remaining steps for completing the launch of our iHelp MAX™ device are for the manufacturer to obtain CE and FCC certifications on the electronics and for the Company to review and test the second set of working samples, we have experienced some delays in the production of the samples due to the city lockdowns and holiday festivals in China, but the Company expects to complete the product reviews by the end of September 2022. The device features a multi-function button for check-in and SOS alerts to ensure that workers in the field can get help in the event their health or safety is at risk. The small, lightweight device is waterproof and durable enough for use indoors or outdoors. The loan worker device includes the following features and functions:

Asset Purchase Agreement - BOAPIN.com
 
On August 3, 2020, effective as of June 30, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Hypersoft Ventures, Inc. (“Asset Purchase Agreement”) where the Company purchased certain assets of Hypersoft Ventures and its international commodities trading portal referenced as BOAPIN.com. As part of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Hypersoft Ventures, Inc., sold 100% of its online commodities trading portal and certain other assets including but not limited to: its data, science and files, marketing material, logos, advertising data, subscriber lists, source code, intellectual property, trade secrets, trademarks, client lists, service markets, supplier data, banking documents, and website registrants derived from The Federation of Industries from the State of Rondônia (Brazil)(“FIERO”), in exchange for 6,700,003 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, a promissory note in the amount of $425,000 and performance-based fees payable to FIERO.
 
At this point of the Comp any’s business evolution, management has decided to focus its efforts on the Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS) and Telehealth business model, including the launch of our new iHelp MAX™ a 4G enabled device and related products in approximately the middle of 2022. As such the Company is in the process of divesting itself of the BOAPIN.com asset and related business components. The Company is seeking to sell its BOAPIN.com assets to a third party but has not been actively searching for a buyer. As of this Annual Report, there is no pending purchaser and the Company has had no offers for the purchase of BOAPIN.com and its assets.
 
As of June 30, 2020, the Company impaired the value of the BOAPIN portal to $-0- for lack of revenue generation, resulting in a loss of $800,200. Given the asset was acquired from a related party and considered to have no value, the cost was recorded as compensation expense, reflected in salaries and wages expense on the Statement of Operations.

iHelp MAX™ Personal Emergency Response Unit
 

iHelp+ 3G™ Unit and Charging base
 
a) MediPendant®
 
MediPendant® is the Company's flagship medical alarm product and the world’s first monitored two-way voice speakerphone pendant for the Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) industry. It allows the user to speak and listen to the operator directly through the pendant. Wearable Health Solutions' alarm pendant also offers superior range of radio frequency capabilities and an enhanced communication range that enables the user to move freely in and about the home up to an extended range that is evolutionary in the PERS industry. Specifically, the MediPendant® system, which is connected through a landline telephone base station, enables the user to move up to 600+ feet (line of sight) away from the main base station, a distance that far exceeds competitors’ offerings on the market today. Competitor offerings instead require the user to be within a much closer proximity to and speaking distance from the base station box, a situation that may not be possible in an emergency event. As part of the MediPendant® product offering, users receive Wearable Health Solutions' two-way communication pendant, base station unit and a subscription to the Company's around- the-clock personal response service monitoring center. Our MediPendant® will not be affected by the discontinued use of the 3G networks as it operates using landline telephone service.
 
Emergency calls made through the Company's MediPendant® device are always handled by certified operators at a call center who are available 24-hours a day and guaranteed to remain on the call with MediPendant® subscribers until the problem is resolved and/or help arrives. Operators are trained to immediately assess the situation and can either connect the caller to a loved-one, or dispatch medical personnel to the user's location. All emergency operators are prepared to bring calm, professional, knowledgeable insight to any situation. Additionally, the call center can also archive a list of personal information for all MediPendant® users that includes an updated list of medications, health information and the subscriber's contact information including home address for location and dispatch purposes. The personal information and medical history are securely stored by the monitoring center and can be provided to the dispatched authority and emergency responders, as necessary.

b) iHelp™
 
The Company also provides a medical alarm device called the iHelp™. The iHelp™ is designed to be easy to use, lightweight yet durable, but with multiple features. The company has invested time, labor, and money into the development and launch of this device which possesses enhanced features and functions including a GPS system, ability to remotely locate a loved one, voice prompts, and a dealer portal that enables dealers to manage their iHelp™ customer base. The iHelp™ dealers enjoy significant company benefits in; the ease of ordering our products, activating and deactivating customers, tracking customer usage, and creating and printing a variety of reports. The iHelp™ dealer program is “turn-key” and offers the dealer the opportunity to provide his/her customers with the latest products without altering "back end" systems. With the introduction of the new and improved iHelp+ 3G™ unit, the iHelp™ is no longer being produced; however, we are still servicing our customers who use our iHelp™ devices and have no plans of retiring that service.
 
c) iHelp+ 3G™
 
The iHelp+ 3G™ is currently our most complete mPERS compliant product and is similar to the iHelp™. However, the iHelp+ 3G™ has additional features and functions, including; the ability to detect falls by the wearer, for example in the shower, Geo-Fencing and tracking ability, operates on the "3G" networks; and can be telehealth enabled via blue tooth low energy 4.0. The unit has superior audio quality, an extended battery life, and operates on GSM networks for use with cell phone providers both domestically and internationally, therefore enabling extended coverage in most areas. With the impending shutdown of the 3G network in the United States, by AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, approximately 20% of our customers (all U.S. based) who are on our iHelp+ 3G™ product will lose access to our services. We are preparing to work with those customers in order to transition them to our next generation iHelp MAX™ product, that will operate on 4G Networks and additional services. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able transition all or some of those customers to our new products. At this time none of our current devices have stopped functioning as there are still active 3G networks. We are not aware of any other countries where 3G networks are being eliminated. The following is a list of when the major cellular companies plan on shutting down their 3G service in the United States as provided by the Federal Communications Commission:
 

· | AT&T: 3G Shutdown date March 31, 2022 
--+--------------------------------------------
· | Verizon: 3G Shutdown date December 31, 2022
· | T-Mobile: 3G Shutdown date March 31, 2022

e) iHelp MAX™ 
 
The iHelp MAX™ our next generation of devices, which will operate on 4G Networks, is anticipated to be telehealth ready along with the platform that should be able to plug into multiple devices, such as smart watches, to enable remote monitoring and data collection of essential vital signs in real-time with historical data via Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi technology. In order to complete iHelp MAX™ and get it telehealth ready, the iHelp MAX™ device will need to be Bluetooth enabled, and we will need to add the device to our HIPAA compliant servers and backend of our mHealth operating system. Being telehealth ready means that our devices will be able to connect to other devices such as smart watches, and body sensors through the use of Bluetooth technology, this will allow our iHelp MAX™ device to link to our customers’ existing devices and use those sensors to help our iHelp MAX™ build a more complete picture of the customers health. Our customers will be able to add other products to their iHelp MAX™ such as our remote patient monitoring and medication reminder features at an additional cost to the basic services we provide. We anticipate the launch of the iHelp MAX™ device in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 which will offer a customized “Lone Worker” program for use with the iHelp MAX™. The iHelp MAX™ devices will run on local mobile networks, such as AT&T, Verizon, Bell Canada, T-Mobile, depending on where the customer is located. The device will feature a multi-function button for check-in and SOS alerts to ensure workers in the field can obtain help in the event their health or safety is at risk. The small, lightweight device is waterproof and durable enough for use indoors or outdoors. The Loan Worker device includes the following features and functions:
 

· | Two-Way Voice - Voice connection to an operator or when an SOS or fall is detected (and optionally missed check-in)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | One-Button Operation - One button to check-in or declare an SOS (monitored 24/7) 
· | Water-Resistant - IPX7: up to 3.3 ft for 30 min 
· | GPS Location - Location reporting within 65 ft 
· | Rechargeable Battery - 72 hours battery life, based on reporting location every 4 hours 
· | SOS Alerting - With 24/7 monitoring service 
· | Fall Detection - With three sensitivity settings and built-in cancellation timer to prevent false alarms 
· | Easy Check-In – With user-controlled start/stop of predefined check-in schedule 
· | Audible Alerts (can be disabled) For SOS, check-in, fall-detection, low battery, and cell signal status 
· | Protected Phone Number – Only designated parties can call your protected number 

 
As a result of the recent emergence of smart mobile wireless and geographic location solutions, these systems will integrate via Bluetooth low energy 4.0 and other FDA approved medical device technologies including biosensors. The Company may collect data on vital signs, send data to HIPAA compliant servers in the cloud, and allow access by caregivers, nurses, doctors, hospitals, and other health organizations. This process can facilitate a low-monthly-cost environment for the implementation of all day user monitoring for emergency, health, and activity status changes. This evolution will change the face of the traditional PERS devices into a Wearable Health & Alarm Monitoring (“WHAM”) market.
 
In order for iHelp MAX™ to become telehealth ready the Company will need to complete the backend software, including engaging HIPPA compliant servers that are equipped for data collection and storage. The Company does not foresee this being a problem as it already has engaged servers for its current products and as such the Company is prepared to extend its server coverage to the new products when ready. As of September 1, 2022, the Company has received samples of the proposed iHelp MAX™ devices and has requested some upgrades to the speaker quality in the devices, unfortunately the factory had been placed in a citywide lockdown and our product production has been delayed several months. We now expect first delivery of the products to occur during the month of September 2022.

Wearable Health Solutions, Inc.
 
Market Background
 
Living arrangements have changed greatly in the United States among older people and other potentially vulnerable segments of the population, including those with physical disabilities and/or medical conditions. During the 20th century, one of the most dramatic changes in the lives of the aging in the United States was the rise of the number of aging people living at home alone. In 1910, for example, only 12% of widows aged 65 or older lived alone. In 1970, this figure was 70% and today it is estimated to be much higher.
 
In the 21st century, this trend has gained momentum with more of the aging and medically at-risk population living alone than at any other time in the past, especially with the rise of the aging Baby Boomer population. The Baby Boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, started turning 65 years old in 2011, with the number of older people set to increase dramatically during 2010 to 2030. According to the U.S. Current Population Survey data, "between 2010 and 2030”, the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to grow by 31.7 million or 79.2%." Thus, the older population in 2030 is projected to be twice as large as in 2000, growing from 35 million to 71.5 million, representing 20% of the total U.S. population in year 2030.
 
This social dynamic of a rising older population is true in both the United States as well as in many developed nations worldwide. Social change, technological advancements, and general lifestyle choices have promoted increased independence and the ability to live alone among other potentially vulnerable segments of the population such as those with physical disabilities or medical conditions. These groups can be especially susceptible to health problems and concerns for their physical wellbeing. Industry experts agree that in order to help facilitate independence and safety, more help is needed to provide these people with contact in case of emergency, or the benefit of support in a time of need. It was in response to this situation that the personal emergency response systems (PERS) industry emerged in the United States and developed the first personal medical alarm. The common use for personal medical alarms is as a safeguard for the aged and persons with certain medical conditions, in case of an age or health related incident that requires immediate attention, where the victim is unable to reach out for assistance via traditional means, including the ability to make a telephone call.
 
Effective PERS, with their emergency alert capabilities, is a key technology solution that can greatly help the vulnerable segment of the population live a more free and active life while maintaining the security of being able to access immediate assistance as needed. In fact, there has been a boom in the PERS market in recent years due to the growing aging population worldwide.
 
While the PERS industry has been in existence for some time, much of the technology within the industry has remained stagnant, with the landline and standalone PERS types remaining a majority of sales. Many of the original PERS solutions are still designed today to provide alerts whereby a push of a button simply triggers a call center operator to respond by calling the device user at home. (“QYResearch Global PERs Devices Market Report, History and Forecast 2016-2027”). The communication is conducted with two-way voice communication done through a centralized speaker box and not the actual device itself. Thus, traditional PERS solutions currently on the market offer communication between user and a call center only through a speaker box. This greatly inhibits the users’ freedom and limits their mobility to an area near the speaker box. (“QYResearch Global PERs Devices Market Report, History and Forecast 2016-2027”)
 
Mobile medical alert devices, such as smart watches, have recently been introduced to the market. They are designed for the younger and more active person with medical issues, and active elderly adults. With the emergence of telehealth and biosensor technology, the market is changing again to an even younger age group with medical issues which require tracking on a regular basis. These new medical alert devices, such as some smart watches, can track blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and can even sense when a person falls, then these devices are potentially able to reach out to medical personnel on behalf of the user without any interaction from that user. Wearable Health Solutions currently offers a wide range of solutions for users from a simple at home medical alarm to a mobile device that enables users to get help in most areas and is working on adding to its function ability through the use of these other features.

The iHelp MAX™ device will be telehealth-ready, and we plan to have multiple additional devices that can be added on and enabled in remote monitoring, data collection, and threshold settings of essential vital signs, including blood pressure, oxygen levels, temperature, and more, in real-time and with historical data via Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi technology.
 
Our Software Platform
 
Our platform is a cloud-hosted service consisting of methods and automation tasks for accepting data transmission from personal safety and medical devices (“PS/M”) and storing, reformatting, and retransmitting this data to subscribers, monitoring centers, healthcare providers, front-end portal/user interfaces, and API controllers.
 
The front-end portal interface provides a user-friendly management and monitoring platform for all of the integrations listed below, coupled with PS/M device fulfillment, tracking, controlling, and remote reprogramming, along with portal user administration and role/privilege assignment, internal activity/audit trails, ordering and invoicing, support portal integration, and any other customizations needed based on solution requirements.
 
Back-end automation and integration with third-party providers and services include:
 

· | SMS, email, and smartphone messaging app push notifications for PS/M event/activity/location alerts and subscriber communication with PS/M devices (with locale specific SMS numbers where available); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Programmatic voice dialing and routing (with locale specific voice numbers where available); 
· | Integration with SIM card providers for management (activation, suspension, and usage monitoring) of airtime; 
· | Flexible signal relay and reformatting for alarm, activity and health event data to central stations and healthcare providers based on unique communication and transmission protocol, whether via API calls or data transmission to TCP/IP or other types of receivers;
· | Integration with customer CRM for account details and user activity; 
· | Integration with billing systems for device/equipment ordering and recurring billing; 
· | API endpoints can be exposed for data access and controlling feature-sets in third party environments. 

 
This technology may also be marketed for future commercial applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices in the ecosystem of remote patient monitoring. Such commercial applications will provide for additional corporate revenue streams and profits. Management believes significant revenues may be derived from such related industry opportunities.
 
The Company is taking a further step into the remote patient monitoring and biosensing space. Our commitment as a Telehealth ready company is demonstrated by the engagement of Product Development Corporation (“MIDI”), to produce our Next Generation Platform, that operates on 4G Networks, which will add updates and upgrades to the iHelp MAX™ device and platform. Features, functionalities and tools to be included and currently under development are; adding the capability of collection and routine measurement of a user’s vital signs such as monitoring of blood pressures, oxygen and glucose levels. The additional features contemplated will allow the iHelp MAX™ device to compile health data and transmit it to the cloud for easy storage, access and retrieval. As a result, we will expand our services and offerings to customers in such areas as Remote Patient Monitoring and Medication Reminders for additional fees and revenues.

Remote Patient Monitoring
 
We will routinely add and embed upgrades and updates to include Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”) systems and relays into our iHelp MAX device. RPM technology is estimated to be approximately an $8.5 billion market according to LEX Consulting and is only in the early stages of adoption. We plan on upgrading the iHelp MAX™ to connect other blue tooth enabled devices in order to provide further assistance to our users by compiling and providing health data in an accessible manner. This RPM health data may help our users in obtaining increased support for chronic care management and allowing for early intervention for health care issues.
Medication Reminders 
 
The iHelp MAX™ will eventually embed an update module that will allow users to input prescription medication schedules as a reminder to users for consumption based on a doctor’s recommendations. This system will track users progress in maintaining medication consumption schedules as advised by physicians where necessary prescription intake may be adjusted based on monitored results.
Market Opportunity
 
The healthcare industry is the largest in the world, with the home healthcare market in developed countries in particular growing rapidly, driven in part by aging baby boomers and a growing shift toward moving some types of healthcare from the hospital and into the home.
 
These trends make the home healthcare sector an increasingly attractive market for successful companies that offer effective solutions in the PERS industry space. The common use for personal medical alarms is as a safeguard for the aged and persons with certain medical conditions who are unable to reach out for assistance via traditional means such as a telephone call. Medical alarms mitigate the potential harm and expensive hospital stays caused by falls or other accidents where tracking devices, like the iHelp+3G™ with wearable biosensors will monitor users’ conditions.
 
There has been a boom in the PERS market in recent years due to the growing aging population worldwide. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people over 65 in the United States is set to jump from approximately 34 million to approximately 65 million in 2025. By 2050, this statistic is projected to reach 86.7 million, with many individuals living at home or in an alternative home-type environment. Worldwide, this number is expected to double from some 550 million currently at age 65 years old to over 1.2 billion seniors by 2025.
 
Experts in the health care industry expect that many of these seniors will prefer to continue living independently at home for as long as possible. This population is expected to be more technology-savvy as consumers of healthcare services and are very interested in playing an active role in personally managing their health and well-being. They may consider technologies that help them gain access to medical care while remaining independent and outside a hospital environment.
 
Effective PERS with their emergency alert capabilities, are a key technology solution that may help the vulnerable segment of the population live a more free and active lifestyle while maintaining the security of immediate assistance access as needed. According to industry statistics users of PERS are typically individuals over the age of 75 who are predominantly female and live alone. The buyers of PERS are frequently the end users’ children.
 
Lifeline Systems, Inc., the founder of the PERS industry in the U.S. approximately 35 years ago, served 250,000 users in the United States and Canada in 1992. Today, Philips Medical Systems' acquisition of Lifeline Medical Alarm has positioned it as the largest provider of traditional PERS systems with over 700,000 monitored accounts, implying that the total market size of users is likely much larger.

Sales and Marketing
 
The Company's marketing efforts are focused in three principal areas
 

i. | Internet sales & marketing,
---+----------------------------


ii. | Wholesale distribution and
----+---------------------------


iii. | International markets.
-----+-----------------------

1) Internet Sales & Marketing
 
The Company markets the MediPendant® through its website at www.MediPendant.com and its iHelp™ mobile medical alarm to dealers at www.ihelpalarm.com. The sales process for medical alarms can be complex which often require several phone calls among the end user or customer's family members before a decision is reached. As a result, the MediPendant® and iHelp™ websites are used mainly for informational purposes with the actual sale typically taking place over the phone with one of our customer service representatives or one of our many dealers. The company uses a variety of techniques, such as Internet paid ad campaigns and social media, in order to drive web traffic to the websites, and initiate potential customer sales calls.
2) Wholesale Distribution
 
The Company currently has several relationships with wholesalers which resell the MediPendant® and the iHelp™ in conjunction with their own monitoring services. The company believes its relationships with its strategic partners is good. The company is currently in discussions with several other wholesale groups interested in distributing our products through their independent channels. With the introduction of the iHelp+ 3G™, iHelp MAX™, Wearable Health Solutions will be marketing its offerings only through Wholesale Distribution Centers in International Markets.
3) International Markets
 
The Company also distributes its products on a wholesale basis to selected international markets. To date, the company has completed sales in Denmark, Ireland, Bermuda, Brazil, the Caribbean, and the People's Republic of China. Considerable International interest has been received in the company's new iHelp+ 3G™, iHelp MAX™ offerings and as a result distribution was initiated in Canada, and Europe. Expansion initiatives are also under consideration for global distribution.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
The Company relies on third parties and suppliers to provide product raw materials, components and to build and package the finished goods. Third parties also provide order fulfillment, warehousing, distribution, cloud-hosting and monitoring services. The Company plans to purchase its products in larger production batches thereby increasing production efficiency for the outsourced suppliers, which will reduce costs.
 
The Company uses contracted third parties to manufacture its products and to monitor our customers. The third-party manufacturers are responsible for receipt and storage of raw material, production and packaging and labeling of finished goods. At present, the Company is dependent upon manufacturers for the production (manufacturing) of all of its products. To the extent the manufacturer should discontinue the relationship with the Company; the Company’s sales could be adversely impacted. The Company believes at the present time it will be able to obtain the quantity of products and supplies it will need to meet orders.
 
The Company purchases all of the products from T&W, ChinaStar, and Eview., third party suppliers and manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders without any long-term agreements. In the event that the current manufacturers are unable to meet supply or manufacturing requirements at some time in the future, the Company may suffer short-term interruptions of delivery of certain products while it establishes an alternative source. While management believes alternative sources are in most cases available and it plans to have also established working relationships with several third-party suppliers and manufacturers, none of these agreements are long-term. The Company also relies on third party carriers for product shipments, including shipments to and from distribution facilities. The Company also relies on third parties to provide the monitoring of the Company’s customers and devices. It is therefore subject to the risks, including employee strikes and inclement weather, associated with the third party’s ability to provide those services to meet the Company’s needs. Failure to deliver products or monitor our customers in a timely and accurate matter would harm the Company’s reputation, business and results of operations.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We may rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, databases, and our brand.
 
The trademarks currently owned by the Company, and for which it intends to seek federal transaction registration are the marks, Wearable Health Solutions, iHelp+ 3G™, iHelp MAX™ and MediPendant®. The Company may federally register other trademarks in the future as the need arises. The Company intends to patent the processes and designs as the need arises; however, the Company currently does not have any federally registered patents.
 
Competition
 
The market for Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS) is highly fragmented with limited information about competitors available.
 
The majority of competitors market first generation PERS systems that rely on a centralized base station (Landline or Standalone type PERS) for communication between the user and the monitoring center; however, the market for mobile based PERS systems has been increasing, with the ability of mobile devices to replace the central base station models. The largest market participant is Philips Lifeline, which makes up approximately 32% of all the revenues in the PERS market, which several years ago purchased Lifeline Medical Alarms. The next two largest market participants, based on revenues, according to the QYR research is believed to be ADT and Turnstall which have 3.4% and 3.3% of the revenues in the PERS Market, respectively. (“QYResearch Global PERs Devices Market Report, History and Forecast 2016-2027”). ADT’s product is a modern medical alert bracelet which connects to a monitoring platform. Additionally, there are dozens of smaller organizations marketing PERS devices and monitoring services. The fragmentation of the market means that there are a lot of opportunities to gain market share; however, most of the companies that are in the PERS market are much larger and better funded than we are, which means that they may be able to come out with new products and features faster than we can and better integrate those new features into their existing products and networks than we can.

Mobile Medical Alerts and health monitoring devices, have recently been introduced into the market and are designed for the adult and younger more active individuals with medical issues. This market is currently dominated by companies that are currently in the health and fitness markets as well as the cell phone markets, such as Apple, Samsung, Garmin, and Fitbit.
 
Mostly all of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources, broader product lines outside of medical and health monitoring, and larger customer bases than we have and are less financially leveraged than we are. As a result, these competitors may be able to: adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly; introduce new and more innovative technological products more quickly; better adapt to downturns in the economy or other decreases in sales; better withstand pressure to accept customer concerns; take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily; devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services; and adopt more aggressive pricing policies.

Regulation
 
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products, software and services. Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in areas such as consumer protection, labor and employment, tax, permitting, and other laws and regulations. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the health monitoring industry. In certain jurisdictions, we must obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing employee selection, training, and business conduct. In addition, we are subject to certain administrative requirements and laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations may include restrictions on the manner in which we promote the sale of our monitoring services and may require us to provide most purchasers of our services with three-day or longer rescission rights.
 
Some local government authorities have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing false alerts. Such measures include requiring permits for individual monitoring systems, revoking such permits following a specified number of false calls, imposing fines on customers or monitoring companies for false notifications, limiting the number of times ambulance or police personnel will respond to alerts at a particular location after a specified number of false alerts, requiring additional verification of an alert notice before the ambulance services or police respond, or providing no response to medical monitoring alerts.
 
The Company has received all necessary approvals to operate in the jurisdictions it is operating. The Company does not expect the costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws to be a significant issue.
