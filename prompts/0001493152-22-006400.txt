ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1969, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Alaska Tanker Company (“ATC”) as of its March 12, 2020 acquisition date, own and operate a fleet of oceangoing vessels engaged in the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S. Flag trade. At December 31, 2021 the Company owned or operated a fleet of 24 vessels totaling an aggregate of approximately 1.7 million dwt. Additional information about the Company’s fleet, including its ownership profile, is set forth under “Fleet Operations— Fleet Summary,” as well as on the Company’s website, www.osg.com.
 
OSG primarily charters its vessels to customers for voyages for specific periods of time at fixed daily amounts through time charters. The Company also charters its vessels for specific voyages at spot rates. Spot market rates are highly volatile due to utilization while in the spot market, which is driven by market forces, including local and worldwide demand for the commodities carried (such as crude oil or petroleum products), volumes of trade, distances that the commodities must be transported, the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products. Time charter rates provide more predictable streams of TCE revenues because they are fixed for specific periods of time. For a more detailed discussion on factors influencing spot and time charter markets, see “Fleet Operations—Commercial Management” below.


The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global and national economies. During 2020, lockdown orders, business closures and travel restrictions among many other events reduced the demand for many products, including petroleum. 2021 was characterized by the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, business recovery and two different COVID-19 variants that all impacted overall business conditions. During the second half of 2021, there were increases in refinery operations and end user demand for transportation fuels. Demand is expected to continue to increase in 2022 to levels exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been an increase in demand, business uncertainty for our customers remains which has resulted in a reluctance to enter into longer term transportation commitments. Customers currently favor shorter term agreements. We believe that as their visibility and confidence in the future returns there will be a resumption of more typical customer behavior and time charter activity will rebound.
 
The ongoing pandemic also resulted in the non-renewal of charters for vessels whose time charters ended late in 2020 and early in 2021. In response to this we placed seven vessels in layup for most of 2021. This allowed us to reduce the operating costs associated with vessels that are without charter. We saw an increase in demand during the second half of 2021. As a result, two of the seven vessels came out of layup in September 2021 and operated in the spot market. One of these two vessels commenced a 26-month time charter in mid-November 2021. A third vessel came out of layup in December 2021 and operated in the spot market. In January 2022 and late February 2022, two more vessels came out of layup. As of March 1, 2022, we have two vessels remaining in layup.


Strategy 
 
We seek to maximize stockholder value by generating strong cash flows through combining the predictability of fixed time charter and contract revenues with opportunistic trading in the spot market; actively managing the size and composition of our fleet over the course of market cycles to increase investment returns and available capital; and entering into value-creating transactions, including acquisitions of competitive or adjacent businesses. The key elements of our strategy are to:

● | Generating strong cash flows by capitalizing on our leading Jones Act market position and long-standing customer relationships, and by combining the predictability of fixed time charter and contract revenues with opportunistic trading in the spot market; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Emphasizing the quality of our operations and adhere to the highest safety and environmental standards attainable; and 
● | Seeking out opportunities to increase scale and drive cost efficiencies through a disciplined approach to investment in core and adjacent asset classes to maximize return on capital across market cycles.

--+---------------------------------

 

We believe we are well-positioned long-term to generate strong cash flows by identifying and taking advantage of attractive chartering opportunities in the U.S. market. We currently operate one of the largest tanker fleets in the U.S. Flag market, with a strong presence in all major U.S. coastwise trades. Our market position allows us to maintain long-standing relationships with many of the largest energy companies, which in some cases date back many decades. We consider attaining the stability of cash flow offered by medium-term charters and contracts of affreightment to be a fundamental characteristic of the objectives of our chartering approach. This is especially observable in the niche businesses within which many of our assets operate. However, the Jones Act market for larger conventional tankers has shifted over the last five years as marginal demand drivers domestically have become more volatile in both crude and refined product flows. Considerations about the appropriate amount of capacity to remain active in the spot market are a regular management discussion point, and balancing time charter and contract coverage with spot market exposure in an uncertain demand environment has been a persistent challenge. A policy of medium-term charters may not be profitable or prove achievable under certain market conditions. As such, during periods of uncertainty in the markets within which we operate, more of our vessels will be exposed to the more volatile and less predictable spot market with a corresponding impact on the amount of revenue our vessels may earn.
 
In addition to the observed increased volatility in the markets for our conventional tankers and ATBs, the future of seaborne energy transportation and the type, design and markets for vessels that will be engaged in this business in the future are evolving in ways not yet well defined. While this evolution may impose additional risks and uncertainties on OSG’s existing business lines, the progressive transformation away from a carbon fuels-based economy could present interesting new business niches for OSG to competitively apply its differentiated set of skills. Participating in a broader spectrum of opportunities in the existing and emerging markets for energy and liquid bulk commodities of all types will remain a focus of the Company as the solution set to these complex problems becomes clearer.
 
We believe that OSG has good standing in the community of our customers, our peers and our regulators, with a long-established reputation for maintaining the highest standards in both protecting the environment and maintaining the health and safety of all of our employees. Continued improvement in these areas is important not only to the constituents directly affected, but equally as important in sustaining a key differentiating competitive factor amongst the customers we serve.
 
We actively manage the size and composition of our fleet through opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions of vessel assets as part of our effort to achieve attractive returns on capital. We seek to opportunistically grow our fleet through the timely and selective acquisition of high-quality secondhand vessels or new-build contracts when we believe those acquisitions will result in attractive returns on invested capital and increased cash flow. We also seek to engage in opportunistic dispositions or repurposing of our vessel assets where we can achieve attractive values relative to their anticipated future earnings from operations as we assess market cycles and requirements. Taken together, we believe these activities will help us to maintain a diverse, high-quality and modern fleet of crude oil, refined product, and potentially other U.S. Flag vessels with an enhanced return on invested capital. We believe our diverse and versatile fleet, as well as our experience and our long-standing relationships with participants in the crude and refined product shipping industry, position us to identify and take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities in any vessel class in the U.S. Flag market.
 
Customers
 
OSG’s customers include major independent oil traders, refinery operators and U.S. and international government entities. The Company’s top two customers comprised 38.8% of shipping revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for further information regarding the Company’s customers for 2021 and 2020.

FLEET OPERATIONS
 
Fleet Summary
 
As of December 31, 2021, OSG’s operating fleet consisted of 24 vessels, 12 of which were owned, with the remaining vessels chartered-in. Vessels chartered-in are on Bareboat Charters.
 

 | Vessels Owned | | Vessels Chartered-In | | Total at December 31, 2021

(1) | Includes two owned shuttle tankers, 11 chartered-in tankers, and two non-Jones Act MR tankers that participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, all of which are U.S. flagged, as well as one owned Marshall Island flagged non-Jones Act MR tanker trading in international markets.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Includes three crude oil tankers doing business in Alaska and one crude oil tanker bareboat chartered-in and in layup. 

 
On December 10, 2021, for five chartered-in vessels with terms ending in December 2022, the Company exercised its option to extend the terms of two of the vessels for an additional year, with terms ending in December 2023, and announced its intention to redeliver three of the vessels at the end of their terms in December 2022.
 
Commercial Management
 
Time-Charter Market
 
The Company’s operating fleet includes a number of vessels that operate on time charters. Within a contract period, time charters provide a predictable level of revenues without the fluctuations inherent in spot-market rates. Once a time charter expires, however, the ability to secure a new time charter may be uncertain and subject to market conditions. Time charters constituted 71% of the Company’s shipping revenues in 2021 and 82% in 2020 and 73% of the Company’s TCE revenues in 2021 and 84% in 2020.
Spot Market
 
Voyage charters and COAs constituted 29% of the Company’s shipping revenues in 2021, 18% in 2020, and 27% of the Company’s aggregate TCE revenues in 2021 and 16% in 2020. Accordingly, the Company’s shipping revenues are affected by prevailing spot rates for voyage charters in the markets in which the Company’s vessels operate. Spot market rates are highly volatile due to utilization while in the spot market, which is driven by market forces, including local and worldwide demand for the commodities carried (such as crude oil or petroleum products), volumes of trade, distances that the commodities must be transported, the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products.
 
Seasonal trends affect oil consumption and consequently vessel demand. While trends in consumption vary with seasons, peaks in demand quite often precede the seasonal consumption peaks as refiners and suppliers try to anticipate consumer demand. The timing of peaks in oil demand vary within the markets in which we operate. Available tonnage is affected over time by the volume of newbuild deliveries, the number of tankers used to store clean products and crude oil, and the removal (principally through recycling or conversion) of existing vessels from service. Recycling is affected by the level of freight rates, recycling prices, vetting standards established by charterers and terminals and by U.S. governmental regulations that establish maintenance standards. Voyage charters include COAs on three vessels. Changes in the percentage contributions are therefore affected by Delaware Bay lightering volumes. In addition, as ships come off of their time charters, they may be forced into short-term trades.

--+---------------------------------

Business Segment
 
The Company has one reportable business segment. The Company’s active vessel fleet, of which 22 are U.S. Flag vessels, consists of three crude oil tankers doing business in Alaska, two conventional ATBs, two lightering ATBs, three shuttle tankers, ten MR tankers, and two non-Jones Act MR tankers that participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program. The Company also owns and operates one Marshall Islands flagged MR tanker which trades internationally. Under the Jones Act, shipping between U.S. ports, including the movement of Alaskan crude oil to U.S. ports, is reserved for U.S. Flag vessels that satisfy Jones Act requirements, including requirements that vessels be constructed in the United States and owned by companies that are more than 75% owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. OSG is one of the largest commercial owners and operators of U.S. Flag vessels and participates in U.S. government programs, including the following:
 
Maritime Security Program—Two non-Jones Act U.S. Flag Product Carriers participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which is designed to ensure that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Each of the vessel-owning companies with a ship that participates in the program receives an annual stipend that is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. Such stipend was $5,250 for each vessel in 2021 and $5,058 on one vessel and $4,607 on one vessel in 2020.
 
Under the terms of the program, the Company expects to receive up to $5,300 annually for each vessel during 2022. The Company does not receive a stipend with respect to any days for which a vessel operates under a time charter to a U.S. government agency.
 
Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“MARAD”) trading restrictions—Two of the modern U.S. Flag ATBs owned by the Company, which are currently used in the Delaware Bay Lightering activity, had their construction financed with the Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”). As such, daily liquidated damages are payable by the Company to MARAD if these vessels operate in contiguous coastwise trades, which is not permitted under trading restrictions currently imposed by the CCF agreement between MARAD and the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, liquidated damages incurred were not material.
 
On March 12, 2020, the Company’s subsidiaries completed the purchase of the Alaskan Explorer, Alaskan Legend and Alaskan Navigator from BP Oil Shipping Company USA and AP AMI Leasing Inc. (“BP”) and entered into a bareboat charter with BP for a fourth vessel, the Alaskan Frontier. The Alaskan Frontier is currently in layup. In connection with these transactions, the Company also completed the acquisition of the other members’ interests in ATC, making ATC a wholly owned subsidiary of OSG. Operating results of these vessels are included from that date.
 
OSG has 11 Handysize product carriers in our U.S. Flag fleet that are chartered-in and provide for the payment of profit share to the owners of the vessels calculated in accordance with the respective charter-in agreements. Due to reserve funding requirements, no profits have yet been paid to the owners or are, based on management’s current forecast, expected to be paid to the owners in the current calendar year.
 
Technical Management
 
OSG’s fleet operations are managed in-house. In addition to regular maintenance and repair, crews onboard each vessel and shore side personnel must ensure that the Company’s fleet meets or exceeds regulatory standards established by the IMO and USCG.
 
The Company recruits, hires and trains the crews on its U.S. Flag vessels. The Company believes that its mandatory training and education requirements exceed the requirements of the USCG. The Company believes its ability to provide professional development for qualified U.S. Flag crew is necessary in a market where skilled labor shortages are expected to remain a challenge. The U.S. Flag fleet is supported by shore side staff that includes fleet managers, marine and technical superintendents, purchasing and marine insurance staff, crewing and training personnel and health, safety, quality and environmental (“SQE”) personnel.

--+---------------------------------

Safety
 
The Company is committed to providing safe, reliable and environmentally sound transportation to its customers. Integral to meeting standards mandated by regulators and customers is the use of robust SMS by the Company. The SMS is a framework of processes and procedures that addresses a spectrum of operational risks associated with quality, environment, health and safety. The SMS is certified to the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”) promulgated by the IMO. To support a culture of compliance and transparency, OSG has an open reporting system on all of its vessels, whereby seafarers can anonymously report possible violations of OSG’s policies and procedures. All open reports are investigated, and appropriate actions are taken when necessary.
HUMAN CAPITAL
 
Our employees are critical to meeting our commitments. In order to achieve this, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees. We emphasize ethical behavior and respect and promote equal opportunity by creating a culture of trust, accountability and empowerment. The sense of responsibility shared by OSG’s mariners and the shore-based support team in meeting the essential need to supply transportation fuels to the markets that we serve is commendable.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 953 employees comprised of 877 seafarers and 76 shore side staff. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with three different U.S. maritime unions which, as of December 31, 2021, covered 718 of the seafarers employed on the Company’s vessels. These agreements are in effect for periods ending between March 2022 and March 2024. Under the collective bargaining agreements, the Company is obligated to make contributions to pension and other welfare programs. 
 
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary as well as employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and certain postretirement benefits.
 
Training and Education. Our seafarers are highly trained, with many officers having both USCG licenses as well as business or engineering degrees. Regardless of position, specialized training to work in the industry based on USCG requirements, as well as vessel-specific training within our fleet is a necessity. Years of experience are required in order to move into higher levels of authority on our vessels. Our training and education programs are designed to address applicable regulations as well as the specific hazards and work environments of each of our vessels.
 
Health and Safety. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes providing personal protective equipment, minimizing crew changes, managing the locations where crew members board and depart from our vessels, certifications by crew members to disclose symptoms and the health of those they have been in contact with, sanitization of the vessels, mandating face coverings, social distancing and temperature checks, and requiring testing and quarantining in certain instances. Protocols were developed with the coordination and assistance of the unions in order to provide consistency within the industry.
 
Having a well-maintained fleet is also critical to create an environment where our crew can work safely. Our fleets undergo regular and frequent surveys by classification societies and regulatory bodies as well as vettings by our customers on an ongoing basis. Issues identified are swiftly addressed. Our seafarers are encouraged to provide transparent reporting of issues in order to remedy conditions as soon as they are observed. We regularly conduct safety reviews to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and all policies and procedures.


COMPETITION
 
OSG’s primary competitors are operators of U.S. Flag oceangoing barges and tankers, operators of rail transportation for crude oil, and operators of refined product pipelines systems that transport refined petroleum products directly from U.S. refineries to markets in the United States. In addition, indirect competition comes from International Flag vessels transporting imported refined petroleum products.

5 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------

CYBER SECURITY
 
OSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. Loss, disruption, or compromise of these systems could significantly impact operations and results.
 
Our information technology controls are subject to audit by internal and external auditors, as well as the American Bureau of Shipping. OSG annually advises its Board of Directors on information security matters and provides user training and monitoring of system access as part of our compliance program. We have not experienced any material cyber security violation or occurrence over the last three years.
 
While we continue to invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Interruption, failure or breach of OSG’s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.”
 
ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND SECURITY MATTERS 
 
All but one of OSG’s vessels are registered in the United States and are subject to the jurisdictional and regulatory oversight of the USCG (under various protocols and agreements covering certain statutory survey and certification functions). OSG owns and operates one vessel registered in the Marshall Islands that is subject to the jurisdictional oversight of the Republic of Marshall Islands (“RMI”) registry (under various protocols and agreements covering certain statutory survey and certification functions).
 
OSG is also subject to compliance with several other government agency regulations, including but not limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Maritime Administration of the United States Department of Transportation, and the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency. OSG vessels are classed with the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and are subject to the requirements of the classification society.
 
The majority of vessels owned and operated by OSG are engaged in U.S. coastwise trade, with some vessels engaged in trade to and from countries outside of the United States. OSG’s vessels operate in a highly regulated environment, subject to international conventions and international, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries such vessels call upon, significantly affecting the operation of the vessels.
 
Geopolitical reactions to industry-related accidents have historically heightened the level of environmental, health, safety and security awareness among various stakeholders, including insurance underwriters, regulators, and charterers, leading to increased regulatory requirements and more stringent inspection regimes on all vessels. In recognition of this heightened awareness, OSG has set appropriate internal controls intended to monitor regulatory developments and to implement measures intended meet the higher expectations of our stakeholders.
 
OSG is required to maintain operating standards for all its vessels emphasizing operational safety and quality, environmental stewardship, preventive planned maintenance, continuous training of its officers and crews and compliance with international and United States regulations, including regular and rigorous in-house inspections and audits. In addition, a variety of governmental and private entities subject OSG’s vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include USCG, local port state control authorities (harbor master or equivalent), flag states, coastal states, Classification Societies and customers, particularly major oil companies and petroleum terminal operators. Certain of these entities require OSG to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of its vessels. Failure to maintain necessary documents or approvals could require OSG to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of OSG’s vessels.
 
OSG believes that the operation of its vessels complies with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, because such laws and regulations are changed frequently, and new laws and regulations impose new or increasingly stringent requirements, OSG cannot predict the cost of complying with requirements beyond those that are currently in force. The impact of future regulatory requirements on operations or the resale value or useful lives of its vessels may result in substantial additional costs in meeting new legal and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Compliance with complex laws and regulations, including those seeking to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases and ballast water treatment, may adversely affect OSG’s business.”

Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Oil
 
The maritime industry is subject to numerous regulations and conventions intended to prevent pollution of the seas from ships. Regulated pollution sources include but are not limited to oil, hazardous substances, garbage, sewage, ballast water, antifouling paint and biofouling organisms.
 
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) Annex I addresses requirements for the prevention of pollution by oil and oily materials generated in the engine room and from the cleaning of cargo tanks, while MARPOL Annex II addresses requirements for the prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances (“NLSs”).
 
The United States regulates the shipping industry with an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, consisting primarily of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). OPA 90 amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Vessel Response Plans (“VRPs”), including marine salvage and firefighting plans, for reporting and responding to vessel emergencies and oil spill scenarios up to a worst-case scenario. The requirements also require OSG to identify and seek to ensure, through contracts or other approved means, the availability of necessary private response resources to respond to a worst-case discharge. The plans must include contractual commitments with clean-up response contractors and salvage and marine firefighters to ensure an immediate response to an oil spill or vessel emergency. OPA 90 also requires training programs and periodic drills for shore side staff and response personnel and for vessels and their crews. OSG maintains valid USCG approved VRPs for each of its tank and non-tank vessels.
 
IMO regulations require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (“SOPEPs”), including periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews. In addition to SOPEPs, OSG has adopted Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans (“SMPEPs”), which cover potential releases not only of oil but of any NLSs. OSG’s SOPEPs and SMPEPs remain valid.
 
US Liability Standards and Limits
 
Under OPA 90, vessel owners, operators and bareboat or demise charterers are responsible parties who are liable, without regard to fault, for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages, including property and natural resource damages and economic loss without physical damage to property, arising from oil spills and pollution from their vessels.

The statute specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes for oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. CERCLA contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages associated with discharges of hazardous substances (other than oil).



7 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------

 

OPA 90 requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability consistent with the limits of liability set forth in the statutes. An owner or operator of more than one vessel is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the vessel having the greatest maximum strict liability under OPA 90 and CERCLA.
 
OSG has provided the requisite proofs of financial security and has received Certificates of Financial Responsibility from the USCG for each of its vessels required to have one. OSG carries various forms of marine insurance for each of its vessels, with pollution liability insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion, and deductibles ranging from $0.025 million to $0.030 million per vessel per incident. However, a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available, in which event there could be a material adverse effect on OSG’s business.
 
International Liability Standards and Limits
 
Compensation for oil pollution damage caused by spills from oil tankers is governed by an international regime developed under the auspices of the IMO. The original International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the “1969 Convention”) was amended in 1992 (the “1992 Protocol”) and entered into force on May 30, 1996.
 
Many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO as set out in the 1969 Convention yet some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol. Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances.


These conventions calculate liability in terms of Special Drawing Rights currency values. The figures in this section are therefore converted into U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates on January 18, 2022 and are approximate.
 
Under the 1992 Protocol, the owner’s liability is limited except where the pollution damage results from its personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. Liability is limited to $6.3 million for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage, $6.3 million plus $886 for each additional gross ton over 5,000 for vessels of 5,000 to 140,000 gross tons, and $126.0 million for vessels over 140,000 gross tons.
 
Vessels trading in states that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. OSG believes that its protection and indemnity insurance will cover any liability under the plan adopted by the IMO.
 
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001 is a separate convention adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in its exclusive economic zones, of states that are party to it. While the United States has not yet ratified this convention, vessels operating internationally would be subject to it, if sailing within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions. OSG believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.

--+---------------------------------

Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Sewage
 
MARPOL Annex IV (“Annex IV”) as well as the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations regulate the discharge of sewage to sea. OSG has implemented all regulatory requirements and believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
 
Sewage discharge is also subject to national and local regulations which set forth further restrictions, in some cases prohibiting the discharge of treated sewage and the establishment of No Discharge Zones (“NDZs”). OSG vessels are all equipped with Marine Sanitation Devices compliant with regulatory requirements for each type of vessel, has implemented controls to comply with various international, national and state regulatory requirements.
 
Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Garbage
 
MARPOL Annex V as well as the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations regulates the prevention of pollution to sea by garbage and e-waste. OSG has implemented all regulatory requirements and believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
Regulations Preventing Air Pollution 
 
MARPOL Annex VI (“Annex VI”) addresses air pollution from vessels and sets limits on sulfur oxide (“SOx”) and nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions from ship exhausts. Annex VI also regulates shipboard incineration and the emission of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from tankers. Vessels are subject to further air emission controls within Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”).
 
Fuel used by all vessels operating in or transiting through the ECA cannot exceed 0.1% m/m sulfur. More stringent NOx emission Tier III emission limits are applicable to engines installed on ships constructed on or after January 1, 2016 operating in ECAs. OSG believes that its vessels comply with the current requirements. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the EPA or the states where OSG operates, compliance could require or affect the timing of fuel costs associated with operating in another ECA.
 
Commencing January 1, 2020, the global sulfur cap for ship operations was reduced from 3.5% m/m to 0.5% m/m outside ECAs as legislated by MARPOL Annex VI. In ECAs, the limit remains at 0.1% m/m.
 
OSG operates one Marshall Islands flag tanker equipped with an open-loop exhaust gas cleaning systems (“EGCS”) designed to burn high-sulfur bunker fuel to comply with the 0.5% sulfur limit. OSG has implemented all regulatory requirements associated with the use of EGCS.
 
Annex VI includes energy efficiency standards for certain new ships through the designation of an Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”). The EEDI standards phase in from 2013 to 2025 and are anticipated to result in significant reductions in fuel consumption as well as air and marine pollution. The composition of OSG’s fleet of vessels, as of December 31, 2021, includes one vessel under which the EEDI standards apply.
 

9 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------

 

The EPA has implemented rules comparable to those of Annex VI to increase the control of air pollutant emissions from certain large marine engines by requiring certain new marine-diesel engines installed on U.S. built ships to meet lower NOx standards. EPA Tier 2 standards generally reduced NOx emissions by 27% and introduced a particulate matter limit (“PM”). EPA Tier 3 standards represent a 50% reduction in PM and a 20% reduction in NOx over Tier 2 levels. EPA Tier 4 standards represent a 90% reduction in PM and 80% reduction in NOx compared to Tier 2 levels and generally require advanced technology such as selective catalytic reduction or exhaust gas recirculation. Adoption of these and emerging standards may require substantial modifications to some of OSG’s existing marine diesel engines and may require OSG to incur substantial capital expenditures if the engines are replaced.
 
The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990 (“CAA”), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in major metropolitan and industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from tank vessel loading and degassing operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. OSG’s vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. All OSG’s vessels are equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures and otherwise increase its costs, OSG believes, based upon the regulations that have been proposed to date, no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated and no material increase in costs are likely to be required as a result of the SIPs program.
 
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environment Control (“DNREC”) monitors OSG’s U.S. Flag lightering activities within the Delaware River. Lightering activities in Delaware are subject to Title V of the Coastal Zone Act of 1972 and OSG is the only marine operator with a Title V permit to engage in lightering operations. These lightering activities are monitored and regulated through DNREC’s Title V air permitting process. The regulations are designed to reduce the number of VOCs entering the atmosphere during a crude oil lightering operation through the use of vapor balancing. This defined process has reduced air emissions associated with venting of crude oil vapors to the atmosphere. OSG’s Delaware Lightering fleet is 100% vapor balance capable.
 
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the “Kyoto Protocol”) requires adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) which contribute to global warming. The United Nations Climate Change Conference forged the Paris Agreement with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as soon as possible. To meet these objectives, the participating countries, acting individually or jointly, are to develop and implement successive nationally determined contributions.
 
Though the Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping, the IMO has committed to developing limits on GHGs from international shipping and has implemented mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. The IMO’s fourth study of GHG emissions was released on August 4, 2020 indicating a 9.6% increase in GHG emissions from global maritime shipping since 2012 and predicted an increase by up to 50% over the next few decades to 2050, relative to 2018, if measures are not taken to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008.
 
In addition, there are regional mandates in ports and certain territorial waters within the European Union (“EU”) regarding reduced SOx emissions. These requirements establish maximum allowable limits for sulfur content on 0.1% m/m in fuel oils used by vessels when operating within certain areas and waters and while at berth in EU ports.

The European Commission has established a working group to develop and assess options for the inclusion of international maritime transport in the GHG reduction commitment of the EU. The EU Monitoring, Reporting, Verification Regulation (“MRV”) creates an EU-wide framework for the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport and to collect and later publish verified annual data on carbon dioxide emissions.


The United Kingdom (“UK”) implemented their own MRV which requires the monitoring of UK-related voyages. OSG will be responsible for submitting its first annual emissions report for vessels subject to the UK MRV scheme.


The primary objectives of Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (“SEEMP”) is to improve the overall operating efficiency of a ship through the implementation of optimized methods for energy and fuel savings. The requirements are to be administered by the USCG for U.S. Flag vessels and the RMI for Marshall Islands flag vessels. In 2021, OSG submitted its second annual fuel oil consumption data for 2020 to the IMO through USCG’s recognized organization, the American Bureau of Shipping.


In June 2021, the IMO adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which enter into force on November 22, 2022, introducing a new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”) and a Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) to be used for grading a ship’s CO2 emissions performance. Verification that a ship’s attained EEXI meets the minimum requirement will occur at the first annual, intermediate, or renewal survey for the IAPP Certificate, whichever comes first on or after January 1, 2023. Each ship’s CII must then be calculated annually using IMO DCS data beginning in 2024 (based on 2023 data) whereby a ship is then assigned a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or E). The CII for each ship is required to be reduced in successive years where a grade of “C” or better indicates the ship remains on target to improve CO2 emissions. Ships graded an “E” or a “D” for three consecutive years are required to improve. While IMO is still finalizing the formulas to be used, OSG is working to ensure its vessels will be compliant with the requirements when the regulations enter into force.


OSG believes that its vessels are compliant with the current requirements of Annex VI and the EPA. Additionally, OSG believes for its vessels that operate in the EU, they are compliant with the regional mandates applicable in the EU. Future passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, EU, United States or other countries where OSG operates that restrict emissions of GHGs could require significant additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on OSG’s business. Although OSG cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to OSG’s results of operations.
 
Ballast Water Pollution Regulations
 
OSG’s vessels are subject to international, national and local ballast water management regulations. At the international level, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (“BWM Convention”) is applicable. It defines a discharge standard consisting of maximum allowable levels of critical invasive species designed to protect the marine environment from the introduction of non-native (alien) species as a result of the carrying of ships’ ballast water from one place to another. As tank vessels must take on ballast water in order to maintain their stability and draft and must discharge the ballast water when they load their next cargo, when emptying the ballast water which they carried from the previous port, they may release organisms and pathogens that have been identified as being potentially harmful in the new environment.

11 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
---+---------------------------------

 

This standard will be met by installing treatment systems that render the invasive species non-viable. In addition, each vessel flying the flag of a signatory to the BWM Convention will be required to have on board a valid International Ballast Water Management Certificate, a Ballast Water Management Plan and a Ballast Water Record Book.
 
The United States is not a signatory to the BWM Convention, and is not expected to be in the future, since it currently regulates ballast water management under two federal, partially overlapping regulatory schemes. One is administered by the USCG under the National Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, as amended by the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, and the other is administered by the EPA under the U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”). Several U.S. states also have their own supplemental requirements. The American Bureau of Shipping has been authorized to issue a Statement of Voluntary Compliance (“SOVC”) to any U.S. Flag vessel that has an approved Ballast Water Management Plan that contains the information required by the BWM Convention. 
 
The discharge of ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation of vessels in U.S. ports as noted above is subject to CWA permitting requirements. In accordance with the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”), OSG is subject to a Vessel General Permit (“VGP”), which addresses, among other matters, the discharge of ballast water and effluents including the submission of annual reports for each vessel OSG operates. The VGP identifies twenty-six vessel discharge streams and establishes numeric ballast water discharge limits that generally align with the performance standards implemented under USCG’s 2012 final rule and the IMO Convention. It also sets more stringent effluent limits for oil to sea interfaces and exhaust gas scrubber wastewater. The EPA’s phase-in schedule generally matches that of the USCG. The EPA determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP, but in December 2013 it issued an Enforcement Response Policy (“ERP”) to address this industry-wide issue. In the ERP, the EPA states that vessels that have missed their compliance dates to meet the numeric discharge limits for ballast, but have received an extension from the USCG, are in compliance with all of the VGP’s requirements, other than the numeric discharge limits, and meet certain other requirements, will be considered a low enforcement priority. While OSG believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the VGP’s numeric discharge limits while in a USCG extension period will be entitled to such low priority treatment as per the ERP, no assurance can be given that they will do so.
 
The “Vessel Incidental Discharge Act” (“VIDA”) restructures the way EPA and the USCG are to regulate incidental discharges in the future, including that the discharges will be regulated under a new CWA Section 312(p) program: Uniform National Standards for Discharges Incidental to Normal Operation of Vessels. VIDA is expected to phase out provisions of the VGP and existing USCG regulations over a four-year period, replacing them with EPA-developed National Standards of Performance (“NSPs”) and USCG implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations for those NSPs, which were expected to become effective in December 2022. Due to change in administrations, the effective date of VIDA is anticipated to be delayed.
 
The USCG promulgated its final rule on ballast water management which requires that treatment systems for domestic and foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters must be type approved by the USCG. Under this rule, a treatment system is required to be installed (or equivalent method of management employed) by the vessel’s first regularly scheduled drydocking after January 1, 2016. The USCG issued over 14,000 extensions for vessels which generally delayed their compliance dates another five years, including various OSG owned and operated vessels. In 2020, OSG began installing ballast water treatment systems on its vessels with the final installation to be completed in 2023.
 
OSG complies with these regulations through ballast water management plans implemented on each of the vessels it technically manages. To meet existing and anticipated ballast water treatment requirements, including those contained in the BWM Convention, OSG has a fleetwide action plan to comply with IMO, EPA, USCG and possibly more stringent U.S. state mandates as they are implemented and become effective, which may require the installation and use of costly control technologies. OSG anticipates that, in the next several years, compliance with the various conventions, laws and regulations relating to ballast water management that have already been adopted or that may be adopted in the future will require substantial additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on OSG’s business.

Safety of Life at Sea
 
The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) convention addresses the safety of merchant ships. Amendments to the SOLAS conventions come into force yearly and flag states are responsible for ensuring that ships under their flag comply with its requirements.
 
The majority of OSG’s vessels are currently registered in the United States, except for one that is registered in RMI, who in coordination with the classification society, inspect vessels to ensure compliance with SOLAS requirements as well as requirements listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable. Various certificates are prescribed by the SOLAS convention as proof of compliance and issued to vessels by the U.S. Coast Guard and by the classification society on their behalf.

Under the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, vessel operators are required to develop a safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy describing how the objectives of a functional safety management system will be met. OSG has a safety management system for each of its operating subsidiaries, with instructions and procedures for the safe operation of its vessels, reporting accidents and non-conformities, internal audits and management reviews and responding to emergencies, as well as, defined levels of responsibility. The ISM Code requires OSG to have a Document of Compliance (“DoC”) for the vessels it operates and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) for each vessel it operates. OSG in turn must undergo an annual internal audit and an external verification audit to maintain the DoC. In accordance with the ISM Code, each vessel must also undergo an annual internal audit at intervals not to exceed 12 months and vessels must undergo an external verification audit twice in a five-year period.
 
OSG maintains a DoC which was reissued for five years on September 17, 2017 with requirements for annual audits by the USCG. ATC maintains a DoC which was reissued for five years on July 11, 2019 with requirements for annual audits by the USCG. OSG is also certified to the SQE requirements of the ABS Guide for Marine Health, Safety, Quality, Environmental and Energy Management, which also includes meeting the requirements of the International Standards of Organization in ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management) and ISO14001:2015 (Environmental Management) for the management of operation of oil tankers, chemical tankers and other cargo ships.

Security Regulations and Practices
 
The U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) requires the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. SOLAS imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the “ISPS Code”). Among other things, the ISPS Code requires the development of vessel security plans and compliance with flag state security certification requirements. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. All of OSG’s vessels have developed and implemented vessel security plans that have been approved by the USCG, have obtained an ISSC and comply with applicable security requirements.
 
OSG monitors the waters in which its vessels operate for pirate activity. Company vessels that transit areas where there is a high risk of pirate activity follow best management practices for reducing risk and preventing pirate attacks compliant with protocols established by the naval coalition protective forces operating in such areas.
 
In recent years, the maritime community has commenced addressing the vulnerability of ship operations to cyber security threats, both at sea and while in port. Exposure to these threats has become pervasive due to the increasing reliance on information and operating technology systems used in the management of ship operations. Because these systems control multiple aspects of ship operations, they become integral parts of system and operational safety. In 2014 IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee supported a Canadian and U.S. recommendation to develop voluntary guidelines on maritime cyber security practices. Since then, a wide variety of regulatory requirements and best practice guidance has been generated by industry stakeholders. In December 2016, the USCG published a cybersecurity policy letter regarding the criteria and process for the reporting of suspicious activity and breach of security and added cybersecurity to the list of security items covered by the MTSA. In June 2017, IMO adopted a resolution to encourage member governments to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately addressed in safety management systems no later than the first annual verification on OSG’s DoC after January 1, 2021. Verification of safety management compliance was conducted in October 2021 with no deficiencies noted.
 
Security breaches and viruses could expose OSG to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third-party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand and increase our costs. OSG completed a fleetwide upgrade of its Information Technology (“IT”) systems in 2020 to further protect its infrastructure against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses. OSG has also implemented a variety of required cyber security protocols and believes that both its operating technology and IT systems are appropriately protected.
 
INSPECTION BY CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES 
 
Every oceangoing vessel must be “classed” by a Classification Society. The Classification Society certifies that the vessel is “in class” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the Classification Society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the Classification Society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The Classification Society also undertakes on request, other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.

14 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
---+---------------------------------

 

Regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed for a vessel to maintain its class certification. For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant and where applicable for special equipment classed, at intervals of 12 months from the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate. Intermediate surveys are typically conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and upon each class renewal. Intermediate surveys may be carried out on the second or third annual survey.
 
Vessels are required to dry dock for inspection of the underwater hull at each intermediate survey and at each class renewal survey. For vessels less than 15 years old, Classification Societies permit in water inspections by divers in lieu of dry docking for intermediate surveys, subject to other requirements of such Classification Societies. Class renewal surveys, known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull.
 
At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the Classification Society would prescribe steel renewals. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the Classification Society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a shipowner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class survey period. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.
 
If defects are found during any survey, the Classification Society surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits.
 
Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”). In December 2013, the IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structure Rules, which will apply to crude oil tankers and dry bulk carriers to be constructed on or after July 1, 2015. All OSG’s vessels are currently, and OSG expects will be, certified as being “in class” by the ABS, a major classification society. All new and secondhand vessels that OSG acquires must be certified prior to their delivery under OSG’s standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement. If the vessel is not certified on the date of closing, OSG has no obligation to take delivery of the vessel.
 
INSURANCE 
 
Consistent with the prevailing practice in the industry, OSG presently carries protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance coverage for pollution of $1.0 billion per occurrence on every vessel in its fleet, as well as for other perils faced by vessel owners and operators in varying limits. Currently, the fleet is entered through membership in four different mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”), all of whom are members of the International Group of P&I clubs. The P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each other’s liabilities. Each P&I Association has capped its exposure to each of its members at approximately $7.5 billion through reinsurance arrangements. As a member of a P&I Association that is a member of the International Group, OSG is subject to calls payable to the P&I Associations based on its claim record as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual P&I Associations of which it is a member, and the members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group. Each of OSG’s vessels is insured by one of four P&I Associations with deductibles ranging from $0.025 million to $0.150 million per vessel per incident. While OSG has historically been able to obtain pollution coverage at commercially reasonable rates, no definitive assurances can be given that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.
 
OSG also carries marine hull and machinery and war risks (including piracy) insurance, which includes the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of its owned and operated vessels except for one where the risk is borne by the vessel’s owner as noted under the contract. The vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value, with deductibles ranging from $0.1 million to $0.125 million per vessel per incident. OSG is self-insured for hull and machinery claims in amounts in excess of the individual vessel deductibles up to a maximum aggregate loss of $0.750 million per policy year.

TAXATION OF THE COMPANY
 
The following U.S. tax law applicable to the Company is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing and U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that changes in or interpretation of existing laws will not occur or will not be retroactive or that anticipated future circumstances will in fact occur.
Tonnage Tax
 
OSG made an election to have the foreign operations of OSG’s U.S. Flag vessels taxed under a “tonnage tax” regime rather than the usual U.S. corporate income tax regime. As a result, OSG’s gross income for U.S. income tax purposes with respect to eligible U.S. Flag vessels does not include (1) income from qualifying shipping activities in U.S. foreign trade (i.e., transportation between the United States and foreign ports or between foreign ports), (2) income from cash, bank deposits and other temporary investments that are reasonably necessary to meet the working capital requirements of qualifying shipping activities, and (3) income from cash or other intangible assets accumulated pursuant to a plan to purchase qualifying shipping assets. OSG’s taxable income with respect to the operations of its eligible U.S. Flag vessels, of which there are two, is based on a “daily notional taxable income,” which is taxed at the highest U.S. corporate income tax rate. The daily notional taxable income from the operation of a qualifying vessel is 40 cents per 100 tons of the net tonnage of the vessel up to 25,000 net tons, and 20 cents per 100 tons of the net tonnage of the vessel in excess of 25,000 net tons. The taxable income of each qualifying vessel is the product of its daily notional taxable income and the number of days during the taxable year that the vessel operates in U.S. foreign trade.
 
OSG’s Marshall Islands flagged vessel, which trades in the international markets, does not qualify for the U.S. income tax exclusion described in the above paragraph. Therefore, the operations of the vessel are subject to U.S. taxation and included in the calculation of taxable income. In addition, the Marshall Islands flagged vessel will be taxed under the “daily notional taxable income” under the Marshall Islands tonnage tax regime. The daily notional taxable income from the operation of the vessel are $500 for 2,500 net tonnage or less, 20 cents per net tonnage between 2,501 to 5,000 net tonnage, 17 cents per net tonnage between 5,001 to 25,000 net tonnage, 15 cents per net tonnage between 25,001 to 50,000 net tonnage and 12.5 cents per net tonnage over 50,000 net tonnage. The tonnage tax of the vessel is the product of its daily notional taxable income and the percentage of days during the taxable year the vessel operates in U.S. foreign trade.
