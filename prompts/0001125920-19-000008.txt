ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

Shutterfly, Inc. (“Shutterfly”) is the leading retailer and manufacturing platform for personalized products and communications and was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1999. In September 2006, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SFLY.” Our principal corporate offices are in Redwood City, California. 
On April 2, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Lifetouch Inc. ("Lifetouch") for an all-cash purchase price of $825.0 million. Lifetouch is the national leader in school photography, built on the enduring tradition of "Picture Day," and serves families through portrait studios and other partnerships.
Shutterfly Consumer and Lifetouch help consumers capture, preserve, and share life’s important moments through professional and personal photography, and personalized products. The Shutterfly brand brings photos to life in photo books, gifts, home décor, and cards and stationery. Lifetouch is the national leader in school photography, built on the enduring tradition of “Picture Day,” and also serves families through portrait studios and other partnerships. Shutterfly Business Solutions delivers digital printing services that enable efficient and effective customer engagement through personalized communications.
We also offer Shutterfly Photos, our cloud photo management service, to our customers. During fall picture day season in 2018, Lifetouch school customers who purchased digital images from mylifetouch.com were able to access these pictures directly within Shutterfly Photos. These customers benefited from free storage for any personal photos they uploaded as well as their Lifetouch photos, and were able to create and purchase personalized products using these photos. Our experience shows that integrating customers’ photos onto Shutterfly Photos is the best way to drive customer engagement and purchases of our products.
Our high-quality products and services and the compelling experience we create for our customers, combined with our focus on continuous innovation, have allowed us to establish premium brands. We realize the benefits of premium brands through high customer loyalty, low customer acquisition costs and premium pricing. Our trusted premium brands are:
Shutterfly Consumer leads the industry in personalized photo products and services. Shutterfly Consumer helps our customers turn their precious memories into lasting keepsakes with cards and stationery, award-winning professionally-bound photo books, personalized gifts and home décor as well as calendars and prints.
The Tiny Prints boutique offers premium cards and stationery, stylish announcements, invitations and personal stationery. The Tiny Prints boutique provides customers exclusive luxe designs curated from top stationery designers. Customers seek us out for our industry-leading designs and exceptional service.
BorrowLenses is a premier online marketplace for high-quality photographic and video equipment rentals.
Groovebook is an iPhone and Android app and subscription service that prints up to 100 mobile phone photos in a Groovebook and mails it to customers every month.
Lifetouch is the national leader in school photography, built on the enduring tradition of “Picture Day.” School Photography captures K-12 portraits and helps high school and college seniors celebrate those graduation milestones and yearbooks. Our Portrait Studios provide professional photographic services for infants, toddlers, families and business professionals throughout the United States under the JCPenney portrait brand at over 400 retail studios. Lifetouch also captures pictures of infants to toddlers for Preschools and daycares nationwide and provides Churches and other groups with pictorial directories and images for purchase.
In addition to these consumer brands, Shutterfly Business Solutions ("SBS") provides personalized direct marketing and other end-consumer communications as well as just-in-time, inventory-free printing for our business customers.
We generate most of our revenue by marketing and manufacturing a variety of products such as portraits, cards and stationery, professionally-bound photo books and yearbooks, personalized gifts and home décor, and calendars and high-quality prints. We manufacture many of these items in our production facilities located throughout the United States and one in Canada. By operating our own production facilities, we can produce high-quality products, innovate rapidly, maintain a favorable cost
 structure and ensure timely shipment to customers, even during peak periods of demand. We also operate a network of partners, across which we can seamlessly manage demand. Some of the products that are currently manufactured for us by third-parties include calendars, mugs, ornaments, candles, pillows and blankets.
While Lifetouch is a leading school photographer in Canada, substantially all our revenue is generated from sales originating in the United States. Shutterfly Consumer and Lifetouch sales have historically been highly seasonal. For example, approximately 50% of our Shutterfly Consumer net revenue occurs during our fiscal fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the traditional fall school and holiday portraits generate approximately 35% of Lifetouch’s annual revenue. We also see an increase in Lifetouch net revenue during the second quarter in connection with the spring portrait season and yearbooks. Our operations and financial performance depend on general economic conditions in the United States, consumer sentiment, and the levels of consumer discretionary spending. We closely monitor these economic measures as their trends are indicators of the health of the overall economy and are some of the key external factors that impact our business.
Our Lifetouch business is based on securing opportunities at schools, preschools, retailers and other organizations to capture unique images of infants, toddlers, children, teenagers, high school and college seniors, adults and families. Through Lifetouch’s arrangements with these “hosts,” Lifetouch captures the images of more than 25 million individuals each year and serves over 10 million households. Through our acquisition of Lifetouch, we potentially gain access to these Lifetouch customers for our Shutterfly Consumer business. Lifetouch has over 11 million non-overlapping three-year active customers (defined as customers who have made at least one purchase from Lifetouch in the last three years). Over time, Lifetouch’s customers will benefit from Shutterfly’s leading cloud-photo management service ("Shutterfly Photos"), product creation capabilities, mobile apps, and broad product range. We expect to realize more revenue from Lifetouch customers within Lifetouch by accelerating the development of Lifetouch's online ordering platforms as well as potentially offering some of Shutterfly’s broader product range to customers. We also expect to realize supply chain, manufacturing, and fulfillment synergies over time.
Our plans for cost synergies center on establishing a common manufacturing platform, achieving greater utilization given our adjacent peak periods (the third quarter for Lifetouch and the fourth quarter for Shutterfly Consumer), and leveraging our combined purchasing power and scale. As part of our strategic planning process for 2019, we further developed our long-term plans to establish a single, next-generation manufacturing platform serving Shutterfly Consumer, Lifetouch and SBS. We refer to this initiative as Project Aspen. 
In conjunction with Project Aspen, we plan to open a new 237,000 square foot facility in Texas in the first half of 2020, which will serve all of our segments. We will also close four legacy Lifetouch facilities in 2019: Loves Park, Illinois; Bloomington, Minnesota; Chico, California; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and will consolidate this volume into existing Shutterfly facilities and the new facility in Texas. The consolidation involves a mix of moving existing Lifetouch equipment to Shutterfly facilities and migrating Lifetouch volumes to Shutterfly's digital presses. Given the adjacent peak periods of the Shutterfly Consumer and the Lifetouch businesses, this consolidation of facilities will provide an opportunity to reduce our reliance on temporary labor while improving the utilization of existing assets. We plan to retain a portion of the impacted employees in this transition, who will move to other existing Shutterfly or Lifetouch facilities, and we will offer appropriate severance and/or retention packages to other employees. 
In addition to the customer acquisition opportunities made possible through our acquisition of Lifetouch, we will continue to acquire customers through multiple marketing channels including search engine marketing (“SEM”) (e.g. Google), social media marketing (e.g. Facebook) and display marketing. Close, frequent customer interactions, coupled with significant investments in sophisticated integrated marketing programs, enable us to obtain user input on new features, functionalities and products. We continue to fine-tune and tailor our promotions and website presentation to specific customer segments. Consequently, our Shutterfly customers are presented with a highly personalized shopping experience, which helps foster a unique and deep relationship with our Shutterfly business.
To successfully execute our strategies, we require a talented leadership team. This is even more critical as we integrate our acquisition of Lifetouch. As a result, we intend to continue our focus to attract, retain, and grow our team; and to build continuity and pursue executional excellence in our daily operations everywhere. Lifetouch is also highly dependent on field sales and photo operations teams, which have a core year-round employee base, supplemented by a large number of seasonal employees. By providing our employees with a great place to work, we believe that we continue to strengthen our high-performance culture.
On February 5, 2019, we announced that Christopher North, President and CEO, will be stepping down at the end of August 2019, and that the Board of Directors has engaged an executive search firm to identify candidates to succeed him. Additionally, the Board of Directors has formed a Strategic Review Committee (the “Strategic Review Committee”) and
 retained a financial advisor, as it continues an ongoing review of strategic and financial alternatives. As part of this review, we affirmed our objective of maintaining gross leverage of 2.5-3.0x Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis, and to return cash in excess of our operating and financing needs to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, within the parameters of appropriate cash management that meets the needs of our highly seasonal business, where substantially all of our cash flow is generated in the last four months of the year. 
Segment Information
On April 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Lifetouch. Because of the acquisition, we have a new operating segment for the Lifetouch business. Our reportable segments are Shutterfly Consumer, Lifetouch, and Shutterfly Business Solutions.
Shutterfly Consumer
Our Shutterfly Consumer revenue includes sales from our brands and are derived from the sale of a variety of products such as cards and stationery, professionally-bound photo books, personalized gifts and home décor, calendars and prints, and related shipping revenues, as well as rental revenue from our BorrowLenses brand. Revenue from advertising displayed on our website is also included in Shutterfly Consumer revenues. Shutterfly Consumer revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was 49% in 2018, 84% in 2017 and 88% in 2016.
Lifetouch
Our Lifetouch revenue is primarily from professional photography services for schools, preschools and retail studios operated by Lifetouch under the JCPenney Portrait brand as well as churches and other groups. Lifetouch revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was 39% in 2018, which is measured from the date of our acquisition on April 2, 2018. 
SBS
Our SBS revenue is primarily from personalized direct marketing and other end-consumer communications as well as just-in-time, inventory-free printing for our business customers. We continue to focus our efforts in expanding our presence in this industry. SBS revenues as a percentage of total net revenue was 12% in 2018, 16% in 2017 and 12% in 2016.
For financial information about each segment, see Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Basis of Presentation” and Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 15-Segment Reporting.” For a discussion of the operational risks associated with each business segment, see Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K, “Risk Factors.”
Strategy
Looking forward, value creation will come from continuing to drive growth in all three of our segments, from delivering substantial cost and revenue synergies from the Lifetouch integration, and from returning capital to shareholders.
• Driving growth in all three of our segments
In the Shutterfly Consumer segment, we will continue to build on our success in mobile, in broader range of products, in category expansion, and in the reacceleration of personalized gifts and home décor while making improvement in our prints and our holiday cards offering, supported by marketing and promotional investments.
In the Lifetouch segment, we will continue to drive account growth in schools and preschools. We are looking to improve our participation rate through awareness supported by direct-to-consumer communications. 
In the SBS segment, we will continue to focus on servicing our existing large customers and landing large new customers. 
• Delivering substantial cost and revenue synergies from our Lifetouch acquisition
With the Lifetouch integration, we are focused on realizing three main value creation opportunities. First, we intend to gain access to many Lifetouch customers as Shutterfly customers; second, we expect to realize more revenue from Lifetouch customers within Lifetouch by accelerating the development of Lifetouch’s online ordering platform and offering products from
 Shutterfly’s broader range; and third, we anticipate gaining significant supply chain, manufacturing, and fulfillment synergies. We will be continuing our path towards a single manufacturing platform to realize cost synergies. 
•  Returning capital to shareholders
Our objective is to maintain gross leverage of 2.5-3.0x Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis, and to return cash in excess of our operating and financing needs to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, within the parameters of appropriate cash management that meets the needs of our highly seasonal business, where substantially all of our cash flow is generated in the last four months of the year.
Business Initiatives
Pivot towards Mobile. 
Mobile is a core element of our growth strategy itself with the percentage of revenue coming from mobile sources for the Shutterfly brand increasing five percentage points for each of the last two years. We will continue to add more products to the app and iterate on our simplified and intuitive creation paths. We will make significant enhancements to our shopping experience and navigation to support discovery even as our product catalog expands, and give greater prominence to personalized campaigns and automatically created products in the app. Our mobile platform has a strong focus on monetization, optimizing conversion to first purchase and driving customer lifetime value through expanded use of impulse buy and cross-sell campaigns. We expect to continue to acquire new customers to mobile whom we would not have acquired on the web, and over time, we expect to create mobile-first and mobile-only experiences as well.
During 2018, we continued to make progress on our mobile app, launching more than 60 new products. During the third quarter we began pushing our machine learning models into the mobile app, so that we can use customers’ local photos on the phone for automated product creation, alongside their cloud-based photos. Photos on the phone are typically the most recent, and recency is a strong predictor of purchase. Our new “Made for You” tile on the home screen of the mobile app, which offers automatically generated products featuring customers’ most relevant photos, is powered by these models. This tile has resulted in statistically significant lift in revenue per customer versus a control group. We also launched a new app-exclusive program called “Free Book A Month,” which presents pre-created photo books meant to be purchased as an impulse buy, with the goal of acquiring new customers and driving more frequent purchases. With the expanded catalog and a new app storefront, it is easier for users to find products easily. In 2018, the percentage of revenue coming from mobile sources for the Shutterfly brand increased to 28% from 23% in 2017 and 18% in 2016. We continued to see a high install-to-first order ratio and attractive customer acquisition costs for the app, with customers acquired via the mobile app having a superior return on investment ("ROI") versus customers acquired via desktop browser.
Offer Customers a Broader Range of Products.
Throughout Shutterfly’s history, category expansion and new product launches have been reliable drivers of growth. We envision a future where we offer the broadest possible selection of premium, personalized products. In 2018, we launched two new product categories, Kids and Pets, while continuing to launch additional product types in the Home Décor and Personalized Gifts categories and making improvements in our Prints and holiday cards offering. We also expect to reduce the cost and time to launch a new product to further accelerate the pace of product introduction in 2019 and beyond. Further, we expect our next major category launch to be in early 2020.
We continue to simplify the process of creating and purchasing personalized products. In 2018 we launched a new shopping cart experience, offering interoperability between using a browser and our mobile app. The new cart significantly improves the speed of checkout and is far more scalable to our peak needs. We have also simplified how we present our pricing to customers, making it easier to understand the discount they receive at every stage of the purchase path and reducing the need to enter discount codes. At the same time, we have continued the shift in our sales offerings away from free promotions and toward paid purchases, which reduces our reliance on our most aggressive promotions, improves the quality of our revenue, and protects our premium brand position. 
As a result of re-engineering our new product launch processes, we reduced the time and cost to launch new products in 2018 with twice as many new products launched in 2018 than in 2017. We have also removed the dependency on our new products launch process from our annual technology road map to allow for more rapid decision-making. We are now able to work from a backlog of products to continuously launch new products throughout the calendar year. We have also been able to identify partners and lower cost locations where we can outsource certain part of the process. Our holiday card range includes
 approximately 1,400 designs in 2018; 800 for Shutterfly and 600 for Tiny Prints, with more than 75% of card designs being new.
We’re also proud of our execution against technology and manufacturing, with significant year-over-year improvements in the speed and availability of our site, apps, and upload experiences. We have also further simplified product creation, automatically cropping and laying out the photos selected by customers in the card or gift of their choice. Our manufacturing platform set new records for quality, delivery speed, and customer service, benefiting from the platform consolidation, process improvements, and equipment upgrades. We continue to reduce our dependency on temporary labor, launching our first robotic automation project, which was used on our Gifts product in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Reacceleration of Personalized Gifts and Home Décor.
Our Personalized Gifts and Home Décor (“PGHD”) delivered a significant re-acceleration of growth, in part thanks to the faster rate of new product introductions with 47 new products in 2018, double the number launched in 2017. During the third quarter of 2018 we also added two new categories on Shutterfly.com: Kids and Pets. These two categories are targeted to children and pet lovers who love to personalize their belongings and make a statement. The product offerings range from kids’ room décor to school supplies and pet accessories such as bandannas, ID tags and pet blankets. The Kids category also includes a new line of personalized children’s storybooks with licensed content from third parties including Nickelodeon.  Further, we expect our next major category launch to be in early 2020.
Improvement in Prints and Holiday Cards Offering.
Improving our holiday card offer is a critical priority in 2019. We expect to have a good / better / best range strategy, optimizing customer acquisition across Shutterfly and Tiny Prints. Shutterfly will continue to have a mass premium offering for our existing loyal customers, but will create a more compelling offering for our value-oriented customers. Tiny Prints will be the focus of our differentiated, premium offering. Our brand spend will also support reinforcing Shutterfly as the definitive place for holiday cards.
Marketing and Promotional Investments.
To support our business strategies, we use a variety of integrated marketing programs, including strategic marketing partnerships, e-mail marketing to prospects and existing customers, search engine marketing ("SEM"), search engine optimization ("SEO"), affiliate marketing, display advertising, traditional direct marketing mailings such as postcards and seasonal catalogs, print advertising and other broadcast media. In addition, because many of our products are either shared over the Internet or given as gifts, the appearance of our brands on the products and packaging provides ongoing advertising. During the fourth quarter we also combined algorithmic targeting with marketing automation technology to begin delivering personalized marketing messages and promotions tailored to the recipient. Throughout 2018, we deployed dozens of highly integrated channel campaigns with a balance of direct response and brand awareness. We invested in new channels and in new content innovation that spotlights our key categories of cards, gifting, pets and storybooks. We also entered into partnerships with high profile celebrity influencers during the 2018 holiday season. We are continuing our philanthropic partnerships with the Make-a-Wish Foundation and The Ellen Show, a partnership which entered its seventh season in 2018. 
Our goal is to improve and, over time, radically simplify every aspect of the creation and purchasing process. We plan to continue to build on the progress we have already made in simplifying the creation and purchase of personalized products, focusing on personalization and targeting across the entire customer journey, ranging from personalized marketing using the customer’s most relevant photographs, to highly targeted promotions, to products automatically created for customers. 
We upgraded our suite of marketing tools and platforms in the first half of 2018, implementing best-in-class third-party platforms, improving our promotional tools to allow more flexible and targeted promotions, building expanded up-sell and cross-sell capabilities, increasing our use of machine-learning-based targeting algorithms, and continuing to expand automated product creation. At the same time, we’ll continue to focus on improving speed and availability. And, as we work towards that long-term vision, we will seek to improve the customer experience we offer today to decrease friction, increase speed, and continue to inspire our customers.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the appointment of Mickey Mericle as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer as marketing and promotions are a key area of focus for 2019 in our Shutterfly Consumer segment. Having on-boarded our new Chief Marketing Officer and a new pricing leader, increased the flexibility of our promotional platform, and integrated best-in-class third-party marketing platforms in 2018, we aim to drive deeper, more personalized engagement with our customers in 2019. 
Cost and Revenue Synergies from the Lifetouch Acquisition. 
Our plans for cost synergies arising from our acquisition of Lifetouch center on establishing a common manufacturing platform, achieving greater utilization given our adjacent peak periods, and leveraging our combined purchasing power and scale. We will be closing four Lifetouch facilities in 2019: Loves Park, Illinois; Bloomington, Minnesota; Chico, California and Chattanooga, Tennessee and will consolidate this volume into existing Shutterfly facilities and the new facility in Texas. Given the adjacent peak periods of the Shutterfly Consumer and the Lifetouch businesses, this consolidation of facilities will further provide opportunity to reduce our reliance on temporary labor while improving the utilization of existing assets. 
During the fall picture day season in 2018, Lifetouch Schools customers who purchased digital images from mylifetouch.com were able to access these pictures directly within Shutterfly Photos, our fully-featured cloud photos service on Shutterfly.com. These customers were able to benefit from free storage for any personal photos they upload as well as their Lifetouch photos, and were able to create and purchase personalized products using all of these photos. Our experience is that integrating customers’ photos onto Shutterfly is by far the best way to drive customer engagement and purchase. This initial technology integration phase is our first step in reaching a small set of customers; we expect modest revenue synergies for these activities in 2019 but are working towards much deeper integration and larger revenue synergies in 2019 and beyond.
We continue to see a number of levers to impact the Lifetouch growth rate, including continued account growth, average order value (“AOV”), and participation rate. A significant driver of participation is awareness, and in 2019, we will further develop our tools and programs to drive awareness, including investing in building marketing teams, integrating platforms, and developing programs, and increasing the portion of the customer base we can reach with direct-to-consumer communications. 
SBS Growth. 
We believe customers are coming to SBS because we provide value at a level much above a traditional printer. We have already demonstrated that we can leverage our existing capabilities to build an entirely new business to a new set of customers, providing variable and just-in-time printing needs and driving volume through our fixed-cost infrastructure and our network of third-party vendors. SBS historically has built dedicated systems to support each large customer and we are now building a scalable platform that enables any of our clients to optimize their integrated marketing campaigns. We intend to leverage this work to obtain additional SBS customers. Over time, we expect to leverage our manufacturing platform to serve a broader set of Enterprise customers and business use-cases above and beyond SBS. In 2017, we took advantage of an opportunity to complete the upgrade of the majority of our color printer fleet that enabled us to improve quality, increase throughput and automation, and lower consumable costs. In 2019, we expect to continue to deliver further improvements on quality, cost, automation, reliance on seasonal labor and speed of delivery.
Technology and Production Systems
We intend to continue our efforts to make improvements in our platform and infrastructure including migration to a modern service-oriented architecture, cloud migration big data strategy and analytics, e-commerce development, and manufacturing scale and automation. The scale and scope economies from our vertically integrated manufacturing and supply chain enable us to extend our competitive position and improve overall customer satisfaction, further strengthening our competitive position. 
We use a combination of proprietary and third-party technology, including the following:
Customer relationship management or CRM system. Our integrated CRM system is composed of various tools designed to convert first-time customers into repeat buyers. We seek to increase annual revenue and gross profit per customer by expanding customer awareness, providing targeted, segmented offers to customers, and encouraging cross- and up-selling. The system uses a variety of data, including website usage patterns, order size, order frequency, products purchased, seasonality factors, image upload, and share usage, as well as customer satisfaction information. This data is continually updated and refreshed in a data warehouse, from which different customer segments are identified and monitored on a continuing basis for targeted marketing communications.
By using this deep customer intelligence and ongoing analysis, we can offer customers a more personalized website experience and target them with specific website promotions, discounts, specialized e-mail, and direct mail offers. Our promotion engine generates special offers that are applied at checkout.
We are also able to dynamically assign visitors to test and control groups who are shown different versions of our services. This form of A-B testing enables us to continuously optimize products, promotions, and user interaction with our websites.
Website system. We have designed our website systems to be secure and highly available within a managed data center as well as within leading public clouds. We can scale to increasing numbers of customers cost-effectively by adding relatively inexpensive industry-standard computers and servers and by scaling our use of public clouds. We have a strong commitment to our privacy policy, and we utilize technologies such as firewalls, encryption technology for secure transmission of personal information between customers’ computers and our website system, and intrusion detection systems.
Image archive. We store our customers’ images in our datacenter-hosted image archive as well as public clouds. Once a customer uploads a photo to our website, it is copied to redundant storage systems. We continue to expand our storage capacity by leveraging public cloud as well as our datacenter to meet increasing customer demand. The combination of our storage systems (cloud, datacenter) provides low storage costs, facilitates the safe, secure archiving of customers’ images and delivers the speed and performance required to enable customers to access and enhance their images in real-time.
Render farm. Once a customer orders a photo or any photo-based product, our render farm technology performs fully automated image processing on the image prior to production. Except for 4x6 and 5x7 prints, the customer’s original uploaded image is retrieved from the storage system for production purposes. The render farm applies automatic algorithms to enhance the color, contrast and sharpness to every image before it is sent to production, unless the customer has explicitly chosen not to do so. The render farm also performs customer-requested edits such as crop, borders, customized back-printing and red-eye removal.
To ensure that output is of consistent quality, we apply our proprietary ColorSure technology during the render stage. ColorSure creates an automated mapping of the image’s specific attributes to the printer’s specific print calibrations and attributes, prior to production. For example, this technology allows a 4x6 print to look the same as a photo printed on an enlargement or in a photo book, even if they are ordered at separate times.
Field Operations, Photographer Scheduling and Sales Management. We use a combination of third party and proprietary systems and algorithms in order to support a large and geographically dispersed operations for our Lifetouch segment. These systems help support a large variety of hosts and field capacity that increases significantly in peak seasons.
Photo Capture Systems. We currently operate several proprietary photo capture systems and studios. These systems are designed for their respective environments and attempt to automate and simplify the photography process to enable photographers to focus on engaging with the subject and to capture genuine expression. In addition, they control for variability in order to optimize quality and efficient production. Many of the capture systems also provide for photographed subject knock-out capabilities which increases the selection of different looks and backgrounds and enhances customer choice efficiently.
To ensure accurate data collection and photo distribution, we utilize several proprietary processes and systems. These capture mechanisms are designed for simplicity to allow the photographer to focus on photography in high volume environments while still maintaining accuracy.
Production system. We currently operate our own production facilities in Fort Mill, South Carolina; Tempe, Arizona; and Shakopee, Minnesota as well as several smaller facilities operated by our Lifetouch teams. Our automated production system controls our production processes, including order management and pick, pack and ship operations. Using proprietary algorithms, the production system analyzes large numbers of orders daily and automates the workflow into our state-of-the-art digital presses.
Shutterfly Photos. We also made progress toward our vision of creating a world-class memory management service connected to our personalized e-commerce solutions with Shutterfly Photos. By modernizing our technology platform and developing new customer-friendly features, we have addressed the friction points caused by multiple devices, fragmented storage options, and limited organization and search capabilities for interacting with photos and videos. 
Competition
The industry for personalized and digital photography products and services is large, evolving, and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face intense competition from a wide range of companies, including the following:
•Online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish, Vistaprint, and many others;
•Social media companies that host and enable mobile access to and posting of images such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat and Google+;
•Photo hosting websites that allow users to upload and share images at no cost such as Apple iCloud and Google Photos;
•“Big Box” retailers such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, and others that offer low cost digital photography products and services. In addition to providing low-cost competitive product offerings on their respective websites, these competitors provide in-store fulfillment and self-service kiosks for printing, and may, among other strategies, offer their customers heavily discounted in-store products and services that compete directly with our offerings;
•Drug stores such as Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, and others that offer low-cost photography products and services as well as in-store pick-up from their photo website Internet orders;
•Traditional offline stationery companies such as PaperSource, Crane & Co., and Papyrus;
•Cloud-based storage services and file-syncing services such as Dropbox, Box, Everalbum, Amazon Photos and iCloud;
•Specialized companies in the photo book and stationery business such as Hallmark, Cardstore by American Greetings, Minted, Invitations by Dawn, Picaboo, Blurb, Mixbook, Postable, Artifact Uprising and Chatbooks;
•Photo-related software companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe;
•Online and offline companies specializing in photo-based merchandise and personalized home décor such as Zazzle, CafePress, Art.Com, Canvas On Demand, Personalization Mall, Personal Creations, Things Remembered, Mark & Graham, CustomInk, Teespring and Etsy.
•Providers of digital alternatives to our products, such as Paperless Post, Evite, Animoto, and PicCollage.
•Home printing service providers such as Hewlett-Packard and Epson that are seeking to expand their printer and ink businesses by gaining market share in the digital photography marketplace;
•Enterprise digital and print communications companies such as RR Donnelley and Sons Company, O'Neil Data Systems, Inc., Quad/Graphics, Inc. and Viatech Publishing Solutions, Inc.;
•Regional photography companies such as Ritz Camera that have established brands and customer bases in existing photography markets;
•Camera and photographic supply companies that rent equipment nationwide both online and in brick-and-mortar stores such as LensRentals.com, Cameralends, AbelCine, and Adorama;
•Picture People and Portrait Innovations in the Lifetouch portrait studio business;
•Independent professional and amateur photographers who enjoy low barriers to entry and can offer flexible business terms and product options in the school photography, church photography and retail studio photography businesses;
•Primarily local and regional players that compete with the Lifetouch School photography business, including Inter-State Studio & Publishing, Barksdale School Portraits, Strawbridge Studios and Dorian Studio in the United States and Artona Group, Edge Imaging, Mountain West Studios and Pegasus School Images in Canada; and
•Jostens, Herff Jones, Balfour and Walsworth Publishing in yearbooks (all of whom have made significant investments in technology) in addition to several online yearbook providers such as Tree Ring and Picaboo.
We believe the primary competitive factors in attracting and retaining customers are brand recognition and trust, quality of products and services, breadth of products and services, user affinity and loyalty, customer service, ease of use, convenience, and price.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, particularly customer trust and loyalty, quality and breadth of products and services, and customer service. Many of our competitors promote their products based on low prices or the convenience of same-day availability for digital photos printed in drugstores or other retail outlets. While we offer exciting and new promotions to ensure we are price competitive, we also distinguish our offering with design, quality and innovation. 
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is part of our strategy for continued growth and competitive differentiation. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 143 issued patents, which expire at various dates between 2019 and 2036, and more than 30 patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to intelligent product creation; image uploading, sharing, and editing; ordering and sharing products; cloud image storage infrastructure; machine learning; manufacturing optimization; mobile and social media technologies; and automated and personalized manufacturing. We intend to pursue corresponding patent coverage in additional countries to the extent we believe such coverage is appropriate and cost efficient. However, we cannot be certain that any of our pending or any future applications will
 be granted. In addition, third parties could bring invalidity, co-inventorship or similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future.
Our primary brands are "Shutterfly," "Lifetouch," "Prestige Portraits," "Tiny Prints," "Wedding Paper Divas," and "BorrowLenses". We hold applications and/or registrations for the Shutterfly, Lifetouch Prestige Portraits, Tiny Prints, Wedding Paper Divas, BorrowLenses and Goovebook trademarks in our major territories of the United States and Canada, as well as in the European Community. We also hold applications and registrations for the Shutterfly trademark in Mexico, Japan and China, and for the Shutterfly and Tiny Prints trademarks in Australia and New Zealand. We own the domains Shutterfly.com, mylifetouch.com, TinyPrints.com, BorrowLenses.com and Groovebook.com among others.
Government Regulation 
The legal environment of the Internet is constantly evolving in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet in general, and how they will relate to our business in particular, is unclear in many cases. Accordingly, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, net neutrality, quality of products, and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Legal issues relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users are currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad.
Numerous laws have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States and provincial and federal level in Canada that could have an impact on our business. These laws include the following:
•The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, similar laws adopted by a number of states, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and Canada's Anti-Spam Law. These laws are intended to regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material and e-mails containing fraudulent headers, regulate our ability to market to U.S. consumers by phone or text messaging, and control other abusive online marketing practices.
•The Communications Decency Act ("CDA"), which gives statutory protection to online service providers who distribute third-party content.
•The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others.
•The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, which are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
•The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and takes effect on January 1, 2020. It applies to entities that do business in California and imposes a number of additional requirements, such as disclosure obligations associated with the personal information that they collect, sell or disclose, including the purposes for which the personal information will be used. The CCPA also grants Californians new rights over their personal information, including for example rights to access personal information, request deletion of the information, and opt out of the sale of such information. The CCPA also includes anti-discrimination provisions that limit businesses’ ability to deny services, charge different prices, or offer different qualities of service to consumers who exercise their rights.
•The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (the “IBIPA”), which was passed by the Illinois General Assembly in October 2008, which guards against the unlawful collection and storing of biometric information.
•Statutes adopted in the State of California and other states, require online services to report certain breaches of the security of personal data, and to report to consumers when their personal data might be disclosed to direct marketers.
•The Family Educational Rights in Privacy Act ("FERPA"), Connecticut’s Act Concerning Student Privacy (Public Act No. 16-189), Colorado’s Student Data Transparency and Security Act (16 CRS 22) and Canadian privacy statutes which regulate the way entities can collect and handle school data as well as contract with schools for services.
•The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) and substantially similar provincial laws which govern how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
•The federal Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD Act") includes provisions governing the use of gift cards, including specific disclosure requirements and a prohibition or limitation on the use of expiration dates and fees. Each state regulates gift cards in its own manner, so long as in concert with the CARD Act. Several states are attempting to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try and obtain unused gift card balances.
•The Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act ("ROSCA") prohibits and prevents Internet-based post-transaction third-party sales and imposes specific requirements on negative option features.
•The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Patient Act"), as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by Congress and state legislatures. Changes to our healthcare costs structure could increase our employee healthcare-related costs.
To resolve some of the remaining legal uncertainty, we expect new U.S. and foreign laws and regulations to be adopted over time that will be directly or indirectly applicable to the Internet and to our activities. In addition, government agencies may begin regulating previously unregulated Internet activities or applying existing laws in new ways to providers of online services. Moreover, the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and business partners is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to government investigations or audits, prosecution for violations of applicable laws and/or substantial liability, including penalties, damages, significant attorneys’ fees and expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations or the need to modify our business practices. From time to time, claims may be threatened against us for aiding and abetting, defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links or that we or others post online. On a more general level, government regulation of the Internet could dampen the growth in the use of the Internet, have the effect of discouraging innovation and investment in Internet-based enterprises or lead to unpredictable litigation.
We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are many federal and state legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted and certain proposals, such as required use of disclaimers, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in user registrations and revenues.
