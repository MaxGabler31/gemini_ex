Company Overview
NRx is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which develops, through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, NeuroRx, Inc., (“NeuroRx”) a Delaware corporation, and NeuroRx 2015 LTD, an Israeli limited liability company, novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and life-threatening pulmonary diseases. During 2021, we became a public, Nasdaq-listed company through a business combination with Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. Our strategy is to apply innovative science to known molecules in the pursuit of therapies for high unmet needs, including lethal conditions. Given the recent geopolitical changes and other developments, our company recently re-prioritized its development activities and geographic focus. We are currently developing the following pharmaceutical products across our psychiatry and pulmonary areas:

● | NRX-100 and NRX-101 are NMDA-targeted medicines designed to address both depression and suicidal ideation. NRX-101 is a patented, fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone. NRX-101 has been granted Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and a Special Protocol Agreement (“SPA”) by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the treatment of severe bipolar depression in patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (“ASIB”) after initial stabilization with ketamine or other effective therapy. We expect to start a new registrational study of NRX-101 for severe bipolar depression in patients with ASIB after initial stabilization with ketamine (NRX-100), using newly-manufactured commercial level material in the second half of 2022. In addition, we are currently initiating a Phase II clinical study for bipolar depression with sub-acute suicidal ideation and behavior (“SSIB”). Furthermore, we are evaluating the potential of NRX-101 in Post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), another area of high unmet need which is also associated with suicidality. NRX-100 is ketamine, which is a generic anesthetic, that is being used off-label in psychiatry. NRX-100 is part of a regimen of two sequential studies that we have agreed to with the FDA as part of our SPA for NRX-101 in the treatment of severe bipolar depression with ASIB.

● | ZYESAMI® (aviptadil), an FDA Fast Track-designated, investigational, drug for COVID-19 related respiratory failure. Aviptadil has previously been used in studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and other respiratory conditions. We have completed a Phase IIb/III clinical study in patients with Acute Respiratory Failure in COVID-19.

Since becoming a public company in May of 2021 we have:

● | Completed a Phase IIb/III trial for the use of one of two our lead Phase III compounds, ZYESAMI®, in patients with Critical COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory failure, and submitted an Emergency Use Application (“EUA”) to the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Partnered with the US National Institutes of Health to introduce ZYESAMI into the NIH-sponsored ACTIVE-3b clinical trial, which has now enrolled approximately 465 patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advanced our manufacturing capabilities for ZYESAMI and NRX-101, including a proprietary formulation of ZYESAMI with 150-180 day stability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
NRx Products in Development
​
​
NRX-101 is a patented, fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone that is the first investigational product supported by a portfolio of intellectual property exclusively licensed to us, related to combinations of NMDA and 5-HT2A targeted medicines for CNS disease. NRX-101 has demonstrated a statistically-significant reduction in depression and suicidality in a randomized Phase II trial against an active comparator (lurasidone) and has been awarded FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement and a Biomarker Letter of Support.
We are re-initiating our psychiatry clinical work and expect to start a new study of NRX-101 for patients with bipolar depression and sub-acute suicidality (SSIB) during the first half of 2022. In the second half of 2022 we expect to start a new registrational study of NRX-101 for severe bipolar depression in patients with ASIB after initial stabilization with ketamine (NRX-100), using newly-manufactured commercial level material.
ZYESAMI®(aviptadil acetate), as a sterile liquid for intravenous administration, has demonstrated a statistically-significant reduction in mortality compared to placebo in patients with critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure when controlling for differences in baseline severity of disease. Without controlling for baseline severity, ZYESAMI demonstrates a numerical but not statistically-significant reduction in mortality. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) is currently conducting an additional Phase III study of ZYESAMI for intravenous administration.

5



A separate Phase II exploratory study using inhaled ZYESAMI that was being conducted by I-SPY has been stopped as it was deemed futile after 52 patients. This futility is most likely driven by the challenges of delivering nebulized medication via mouthpiece to critically ill patients receiving high flow oxygen support (6 liters or more) because the turbulence generated by high flow oxygen prevents sufficient levels of the drug inhaled by mouth from reaching the lungs, although other factors may also play a role.
Given the recent geopolitical changes and our decision to focus on ZYESAMI and NRX-101 principally in the U.S., we have recently decided to discontinue the BriLifeTM vaccine project.
In 2022 we will be focused on some of the following priorities:

● | Restarting the clinical development of our psychiatry franchise;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collaborating with NIH in completing ZYESAMI enrollment of the ACTIV-3b trial;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engaging with FDA regarding our latest EUA resubmission for ZYESAMI, as well as exploring submission under the Accelerated Approval path; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring the applicability of the use of ZYESAMI in other respiratory and non-respiratory indications.

History of our development of NRX-100/101 for suicidal depression and post-traumatic stress disorder
NRx was founded in 2015 by Drs. Jonathan Javitt and Daniel Javitt to develop drugs that aim to treat psychiatric disorders based on Daniel Javitt’s discovery of a synergistic effect when NMDA antagonists are combined with inhibitors of the brain’s 5-HT2A receptor (e.g., SSRI antidepressants and atypical antipsychotic drugs). This synergy has now been demonstrated in both laboratory rodent behavioral experiments and in multiple Phase II clinical trials and resulted in a Composition of Matter patent awarded in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. Dr. Daniel Javitt observed that when patients with depression were treated with D-cycloserine (“DCS”), an NMDA antagonist, in combination with antidepressants, they manifested increased antidepressant effect, but did not exhibit the hallucinations and other NMDA effects previously reported with DCS. He further observed that DCS appeared to blunt some of the antidepressant side effects (akathisia) common to all known serotonin-targeted anti-depressants.
These patented discoveries support NRX-101, the first investigational oral antidepressant to be granted Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA for Severe Bipolar Depression in Patients with ASIB. We are engaged in the research, development and future commercialization of this and other products for the treatment of patients suffering from suicidal ideation in the setting of bipolar depression and major depressive disorder (“MDD”) as well as PTSD and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Drugs that inhibit the brain’s NMDA receptor without ketamine’s limitations, have generated substantial interest, and have been explored for the treatment of the above conditions since the finding that ketamine has potent effects in reducing depression and suicidal ideation. It is our view that NRX-101 and our intellectual property to combine different molecules may yield a competitive advantage to use NMDA-inhibiting drugs for this purpose, as other compounds may be limited by adverse elements such as neurotoxicity (with prolonged use), hallucinations, potential habituation (i.e., addictive properties), blood pressure elevations, and/or lack of oral bioavailability.
This synergy is the key discovery underlying the patent portfolio described below. The scientific findings showed that some of the side effects of an NMDA drug can be blocked by the 5-HT2A drug and, in turn, the NMDA component can block the akathisia, a known side effect of 5-HT2A-blocking drugs which is known to predispose to suicide. This dual-targeted approach is the basis of our worldwide patent portfolio, which currently encompasses 43 pending applications, and 47 granted patents in multiple jurisdictions covering both Compositions of Matter and Methods of Use (See “NRx Patent Portfolio”). The relevant patents and patent applications in this portfolio are either owned by NRx, exclusively licensed to NRx by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), a Delaware limited liability company solely owned by Dr. Daniel Javitt (the “Glytech License”), or licensed to NRx by Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital Ezrat Nashim (“SHMH”), a non-profit organization organized under the laws of the State of Israel (the “SHMH License”).

NRx owns a composition of matter patent that covers NRX-101 in the U.S. Patents under the Glytech License, which cover compositions of matter (including NRX-101 and pipeline therapeutic candidates) and methods of use (including methods of using NRX-101 in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidal ideation and in treating PTSD), have been granted in the U.S., Europe (including validation by 18 members of the European Patent Convention), Japan, Australia and China.
Additional patent applications under the Glytech License cover compositions of matter and methods of use of pipeline therapeutic candidates other than NRX-101 together with methods of use of NRX-101 in treating additional CNS disorders. These patents are pending in various locations including the U.S., Canada, Israel, Europe, Japan, Australia and China. Assuming all maintenance fees are timely paid in each jurisdiction and that the patents are not held invalid or unenforceable by a court or patent office, the patents licensed to NRx by Glytech will expire in each jurisdiction in which they have been granted in 2033 (for the base NRX-101 patents) and 2038 (for the PTSD treatment patents). See “Summary of NRx Material In-licensing Obligations — NRX-100/101 — Glytech Development and License Agreement” for more information. We intend to seek patent extensions as allowed by law.
Patents under the SHMH License, which cover methods of use for NRX-101 in the treatment of depression have been granted in the U.S. and Europe with additional patent applications covering similar subject matter pending in these countries and in Israel and Canada. Assuming all maintenance fees are timely paid in each jurisdiction and that the patents are not held invalid or unenforceable by a court or patent office, the patents licensed to NRx by SHMH will expire in each jurisdiction in which they have been granted in 2032. See “Summary of NRx Material In-licensing Obligations — NRX-100/101 — Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital License Agreement” for more information.
History of ZYESAMI Development
ZYESAMI® is named for Professor Sami Said, Distinguished Professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook (“SUNY”), who discovered the endogenous neuropeptide Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (“VIP”) in 1970 and published a large number of peer-reviewed studies on its effects. ZYESAMI is a patent-pending shelf-stable composition of matter formulation based upon VIP. VIP showed promise for treating Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (“ARDS”) associated with ARDS in 2005.
The term “VIP” should be interpreted as referring to the natural peptide produced in the human body, while the terms “aviptadil” and “ZYESAMI” refer to our drug substance (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredient) and drug product, respectively. Aviptadil is the generic name for synthetically-manufactured VIP, as distinct from the natural peptide.
VIP became uniquely important in 2020 when it was demonstrated to have potential to treat respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. While we are still learning about the adverse effects of COVID-19 on the body, the scientific rationale for use of aviptadil in this disease appears attractive. Its potential effectiveness in treating COVID-19 is based on the principle that the coronavirus specifically invades the Alveolar Type II (“ATII”) cell of the pulmonary (lung) epithelium, where it blocks surfactant production, replicates into millions of virus particles, unleashes inflammatory cytokines, causes cell death, and deprives the lung of surfactant, which is the fluid that lines the lung and allows oxygen to pass from the air to the blood. ZYESAMI was shown in preclinical laboratory experiments at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) to increase the production of surfactant, block replication of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in human lung cells, block cytokine production, and block lung cell death (cytopathy). This attack on ATII cells is believed to be a common mechanism of ARDS in sepsis, influenza, and conditions other than COVID-19.
VIP is also shown to have important potential effects in the treatment of other non-infectious lung diseases including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”), Sarcoidosis, asthma/allergy, and Chronic Respiratory Inflammation Syndrome. We intend to research the use of VIP in these and other lung conditions in the future, as well as other non-lung disorders. VIP is also known to be active in the brain and we plan to understand its potential use in the treatment of Central Nervous System (“CNS”) diseases if an appropriate mechanism of CNS delivery can be developed.
Our involvement with aviptadil began on March 4, 2020 when Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief Therapeutics”) approached our then Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Javitt, and asked him to develop an aviptadil formulation based on archival data, including an FDA Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) (52,088). 

7



Accordingly, with the agreement of Relief Therapeutics, NRx filed IND 149,152 on March 24, 2020 and was issued a “Study May Proceed” letter by the FDA on March 28, 2020. NRx proceeded to work with a manufacturer of clinical supplies, engaged a clinical research organization, and enabled enrollment of the first patient at the end of May 2020. The companies agreed to an initial framework for cooperation under which Relief Therapeutics would fund all development costs related to aviptadil. For the next five months, Relief Therapeutics and NRx discussed how to share the obligations and economic benefits of developing aviptadil. See “Relief Relationship in the Development of ZYESAMI / Aviptadil” below.
Our first VIP-derived product ZYESAMI was awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA in June 2020 and was admitted to the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. We have completed a Phase IIb/III randomized controlled trial of ZYESAMI vs. placebo (NCT 04311697), conducted under FDA Fast Track designation. The Phase IIb/III trial enrolled 196 patients and the last patient completed 60 days of observation on February 22, 2021. Across all patients and sites, ZYESAMI did not meet the primary prespecified endpoint for “alive and free of respiratory failure” at day 60 (P=.085), but did meet this endpoint (P=.02) when adjusting for treatment site. Across all patients and sites, ZYESAMI demonstrated a statistically significant increase in odds of survival through day 60, whether or not the participant was fully recovered (P <.01). In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of patients already treated with remdesivir (70% of the randomized cohort), the primary endpoint was met (P=.03) with 3-fold increased odds compared to placebo at both 28 and 60 days and 4-fold increased odds of survival was seen (P=.006). This post-hoc analysis was done based on the FDA’s feedback in their denial to our Breakthrough Therapy designation request. On February 10, 2022 we resubmitted our Emergency Use Application request focused on this more narrow population.
The ratio of arterial blood oxygen concentration (PaO2) to the concentration of oxygen delivered to the lung (FiO2), known as the PF ratio is an important intermediate clinical endpoint that is associated with survival (see figure 1 below). Rapid (i.e. within 24 hours) improvement in the PF ratio has been seen in our Phase IIb/II trial, the Houston Methodist open label trial, and inpatients treated under the Right to Try program. Documentation of improvement on intermediate clinical endpoints may constitute a basis for applying for accelerated approval of a new medicine pending confirmatory studies that must be submitted as a post-approval commitment.
COVID-19 is widely demonstrated to be associated with release of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6) and this Cytokine Release Syndrome, colloquially known as “cytokine storm”, is predictive of mortality in numerous clinical studies. Across all patients and sites of care in our study, those treated with placebo showed a ten-fold increase in blood IL-6 levels within 7 days of treatment, while those treated with ZYESAMI showed a 2-fold increase (P<.02). Preventing this rise in IL-6 was statistically correlated with improved survival in ZYESAMI-treated patients (P<.0001) (see figure 2 below). In an open-label trial, ZYESAMI similarly demonstrated a substantial and statistically significant difference in cytokine levels between those treated with ZYESAMI and those who were treated with the best-available standard of care. This demonstrated effect on Cytokine IL-6 potentially constitutes a surrogate or biomarker endpoint as defined under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. 
​

In a published open label study as well as other data, we have seen rapid and dramatic improvement in some patients. Overall, when patients are treated earlier, there appears to be a better chance of recovery. In December 2021, a Texas regional hospital reported to us that 16 of 19 patients treated with ZYESAMI had survived through 28 days and 14 of those patients had been discharged to home or to rehabilitation facilities. These patients were treated within the Right to Try program, after exhausting all approved therapies. An example of rapid clearing of the x-ray signs of COVID-19 is shown below.
While findings such as this are highly encouraging and have been seen in multiple patients, drug approval can only be obtained through randomized prospective trials, such as the ones in which we are engaged. Treatment of patients with advanced stages of COVID-19 can be very challenging. Patients with Critical COVID-19 (who are in the ICU) can develop multiple complications, which ZYESAMI does not treat. Such complications can lead to high morbidity and mortality, e.g. renal failure and infections/sepsis, that is not addressed by investigational drugs such as ZYESAMI. Furthermore, published literature also indicates that percent occupancy of an ICU and other factors can influence overall outcomes and mortality of patients with COVID-19. Overall, clinical studies of COVID-19 in advanced stages of the disease are and will continue to be very challenging.
ZYESAMI has demonstrated promise in a randomized, double-blind multicenter trial, but has not yet met FDA’s standards for efficacy and safety. We applied for Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) with the FDA on May 31, 2021, based on a finding of near statistical significance at day 60 on the primary endpoint of recovery from respiratory failure and a statistically significant improvement in survival at day 60. In November 2021, the FDA notified us that it was unable to issue the EUA at that time due to insufficient data regarding the known and potential benefits of ZYESAMI and the known and potential risks of ZYESAMI in patients suffering from Critical COVID-19 with respiratory failure. In its letter, the FDA noted that so far, it has reviewed safety in only 131 randomized patients treated with ZYESAMI. The FDA similarly denied an application for Breakthrough Therapy designation, but indicated we could reapply if we were able to provide data on the performance of ZYESAMI compared to remdesivir, a COVID-19 treatment offered by Gilead Sciences. In response, the Company worked to coordinate a review by the FDA of approximately 750 patients treated with ZYESAMI in our clinical trials, our Expanded Access Programs, our Right to Try Program and the NIH ACTIV-3b trial. The Company narrowed its request for EUA to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who are at risk of death despite treatment with remdesivir and other approved therapies, and submitted a new request for EUA and Breakthrough Therapy designation to the FDA. Although the COVID-19 environment continues to evolve rapidly, and the unmet need continues to be high, it is uncertain if the FDA will deem this post-hoc analysis of our prior data as sufficient basis for Emergency Use Authorization for this narrower patient population. As of the date of this filing, that request is still pending. See “Risk factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - Our initial application to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization was not successful.”
Based on the scientific foundation of the COVID-AIV trial, NRx was selected by the NIH for inclusion in the ACTIV-3b TESICO trial. This represents an important public sector investment in NRx. The ACTIV-3b TESICO trial is publicly-financed, but could provide NRx with Phase III data to submit in support of drug registration, should the trial demonstrate clinical success. The TESICO protocol includes geographic participation from Scandinavia, the EU, the UK, and Brazil. In September 2021 NRx passed a European Qualified Person (QP) audit at its manufacturing site (Alcami in North Carolina). As a result, NRx expects to be able to ship investigational drug to the EU, the UK, and Brazil in mid-2022. Given the opportunity afforded by the investment of the NIH and the inclusion in the ACTIV-3b TESICO trial, NRx has decided to principally focus its ongoing regulatory efforts for ZYESAMI in this direction.
According the NIH website, ZYESAMI is the sole investigational medicine still under consideration in ACTIV-3b and four reviews conducted by the NIH Data Safety Monitoring Board have identified no new safety concerns.

ZYESAMI’s formulation and composition of matter is based on discoveries made by NRx and is not based on any prior U.S. or international patent. U.S. Patent 8178489B2 and its foreign counterparts cover only formulations of aviptadil that are formulated in a buffer. Laboratory evidence suggests that VIP (aviptadil) aggregates and may be inactivated by known buffers. We conducted research to determine the molecular sites at which aviptadil is degraded (causing its instability) and invented a stable composition of matter that allows for 150-180 day stability at refrigerated temperatures with expected multi-year stability while frozen. Those discoveries led to the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/295,058 which was filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) on December 30, 2021, and to the filing of Utility Patent Application No. 17/574,753 with the USPTO on January 13, 2022.
In the event that no patent protection is granted covering the composition of ZYESAMI, if the drug is approved by the FDA, it is anticipated to receive at least five (5) years of data exclusivity from the FDA under what is commonly known as “paragraph 4” protections. Should no patents be granted by the end of this data exclusivity period, competitors may be able to file an ANDA to market generic versions of ZYESAMI.
Relief Therapeutics Relationship in the Development of ZYESAMI / Aviptadil
In September 2020, NRx and Relief Therapeutics entered into the Binding Collaboration Agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”) under which NRx and Relief Therapeutics agreed to collaborate as separate companies and to share profits from the “Product” defined in paragraph 25 of the Collaboration Agreement as any formulation of aviptadil for which Relief Therapeutics would pay the costs of research and development. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Relief Therapeutics was obligated to fund all development costs related to aviptadil for respiratory diseases in exchange for a predetermined division of profits and NRx had the right to continue its development program with other investor funds should Relief Therapeutics not provide such funding.
We reported to Relief Therapeutics in December 2020 that the formulation data provided by Relief Therapeutics could not be replicated and that a new formulation of composition and manufacturing method was required. Relief Therapeutics declined to fund the costs of developing a stable formulation of aviptadil, which NRx proceeded to do with funding from other investors under the tradename ZYESAMI.
On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a complaint in New York State Court (the “NYS Court”), claiming that NRx failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement (the “Complaint”). The Complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. We believe that the claims are baseless and without merit. In addition to asking the NYS Court to enter summary judgment in favor of NRx with regard to Relief Therapeutics’ demand to receive profit without having funded the underlying product, NRx has filed a complaint seeking damages of at least $185 million.
The parties to the lawsuits agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation, held a mediation meeting on February 22, 2022, and plan to hold an additional mediation meeting in the coming months. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully resolve the dispute through mediation or that, in the event the dispute continues in litigation, we will be successful in our claims against Relief Therapeutics or our opposition to Relief Therapeutics’ claims. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business and Industry - The outcome of any current or future disputes, claims, arbitration and litigation, including our dispute with Relief Therapeutics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 recognized pathways by which NRx might gain marketing approval or authorization for ZYESAMI in the United States: Emergency Use Authorization, Accelerated Approval, and (traditional) New Drug Approval:
Pathway 1: Emergency Use Authorization.
In the setting of a public health emergency declared by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, the FDA is empowered to grant EUA to drugs and vaccines that may be beneficial in combating the emergency. Emergency Use Authorization may grant one year of limited marketing authorization to a medicine that “may be effective,” during which time the sponsor is expected to demonstrate traditional safety and efficacy in support of a New Drug Application. In September 2020, we opened a Pre-EUA file with the FDA and requested a narrow EUA only to treat patients who were already allowed under the Expanded Access Protocol granted by the FDA in July 2020 but whose hospitals could not implement the administrative requirements of the Expanded Access Program. The FDA notified us in December 2020 that EUA could only be granted upon submission of randomized, placebo-controlled data and stated that such data would be reviewed “promptly” upon submission. In a subsequent communication in January 2021, the FDA advised us that review of complete efficacy and safety data would be required for an EUA determination.
On May 31, 2021, we filed for EUA with the FDA for ZYESAMI, thereby delivering a regulatory file delineating safety and efficacy data of an investigational drug within approximately 3 months of last visit in a clinical trial. As noted elsewhere in this annual report, the initial request for EUA was denied and we have filed a new request for EUA in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who are at immediate risk of death despite treatment with remdesivir and other approved therapies. As of the date of this annual report, that request is still pending.
Pathway 2: Accelerated Approval.
Accelerated approval is a new regulatory pathway emphasized by Congress as part of the 21st Century Cures Act that allows early approval of treatment or drugs that are used in the treatment of severe or life-threatening indications and fulfill and unmet medical need. In 2012, Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety Innovations Act (“FDASIA”). Section 901 of FDASIA amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the FDA to base accelerated approval for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint.
We plan to assess whether filing an application for accelerated approval this year might offer a quicker path to marketing authorization for ZYESAMI than the traditional New Drug Approval pathway. Additionally, we await findings 

11



from our radiographic substudy in order to learn whether the radiographic improvement may constitute an intermediate clinical endpoint.
Pathway 3: New Drug Approval:
The traditional pathway of New Drug Approval requires demonstration of safety and efficacy in adequately controlled studies. ACTIV-3b is designed as a Phase III trial. Therefore, we believe that should the ACTIV-3b trial demonstrate a statistically-significant benefit to patients who are treated with ZYESAMI compared to those treated with placebo, the results of this trial – together with our other trials described herein – may support a finding of efficacy in support of New Drug Approval. NIH has reported a likely readout of the ACTIV-3b trial in early 4Q 2022, notwithstanding Data Safety and Monitoring Board reviews, one of which is expected at the end of April 2022. Under rolling review, NRx has the ability to submit all completed sections of a New Drug Approval application for ZYESAMI for review prior to that readout in order to facilitate an earlier review of a ZYESAMI NDA should the ACTIV-3b trial demonstrate efficacy.
Non-U.S. initiatives:
In the second half of 2021, NRx was invited to meet with the Prime Minister and Minister of Health of the Nation of Georgia, to discuss clinical trial operations in Georgia, and to apply for emergency use authorization for intravenous ZYESAMI in Georgia. In late July 2021, NRx was notified that an authorization for emergency use of ZYESAMI was issued by Georgia’s Ministry of Health to the Georgian Respiratory Association. NRx arranged for one of its principal investigators from the U.S. to travel to Georgia to train physicians and medical personnel in the use of ZYESAMI. Shortly thereafter, Georgia entered a period of political instability. The Minister of Health resigned in December 2021. As previously disclosed, the Company’s Board has determined that it cannot confirm the current status or effectiveness of the authorization for emergency use of ZYESAMI in Georgia. In light of the uncertainty regarding the recent changes at the Ministry of Health in Georgia and the ongoing hostilities in Eastern Europe, the Company is not currently pursuing regulatory or commercial opportunities in Georgia (which neighbors Russia and Ukraine) or elsewhere in the Caucasus region or Europe. The Company believes its strategic priorities are principally based in the U.S.
Clinical Trials and Objectives
NRX-101 Phase IIb/III Clinical Trial
We initiated a clinical research program of NRX-101 during the second half of 2017 under an FDA IND application that was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in August 2017 and was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in November 2018. In April 2018, the FDA granted a Special Protocol Agreement (SPA). We completed a Phase II clinical trial of NRX-101 in patients with Severe Bipolar Depression and Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) following initial stabilization with a single dose of ketamine (NRX-100) and saw a statistically significant reduction in depression (P=0.04) and suicidal ideation (P=0.02) compared to lurasidone alone over 42 days of treatment. If this statistically-significant advantage is replicated in the Phase III clinical trial, under the terms agreed to with the FDA in our Special Protocol Agreement, we aim to submit an NDA to the FDA for the regulatory approval and commercialization of NRX-101 in the U.S. in 2023 and will evaluate our ability to submit to regulatory agencies in other regions or countries.
We believe our products are urgently needed by patients because no current serotonin-targeted antidepressant (such as SSRI drugs) or atypical antipsychotic (e.g., the D2/5HT2A drugs) has been shown to decrease suicidal ideation in patients with bipolar depression or PTSD. Moreover, drugs in these classes bear an FDA-mandated warning regarding the potential increased risk of suicide in vulnerable patients, and to monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for the increased risk of suicide. Ketamine has been shown to decrease suicidal ideation because of its NMDA-blocking properties, but is known to be hallucinogenic, addictive, potentially neurotoxic, and not administrable by mouth. The only FDA-approved therapy for patients with suicidal bipolar depression remains electroconvulsive therapy (“ECT”), a treatment that is known to be effective, but to have a large number of serious side effects, and is very disruptive to the lives of these individuals.
Analysis of our first Phase II study, the STABIL-B trial, showed a statistically significant reduction in depression and suicidal ideation vs. the control group over 42 days. We commenced a pivotal Phase IIb/III clinical trial under an FDA Special Protocol Agreement of our lead product candidate, NRX-101, in 2019 and paused that study due to the pandemic.

During this pause we advanced the commercial manufacture of NRX-101 and anticipate receiving commercially-manufactured supplies of investigational product in next few months. In the meantime, we are initiating a Phase II trial of NRX-101 in patients with bipolar depression with SSIB.

ZYESAMI Phase IIb/III Clinical Trial for treatment of Respiratory Failure in Critical COVID-19 (COVID- AIV)
We completed a 196-person Phase IIb/III clinical trial of intravenous ZYESAMI for the treatment of respiratory failure in patients with critical COVID-19 (the “Intravenous Trial”). The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a public health emergency under the terms of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. Accordingly, ZYESAMI could be authorized for use in the U.S. under the standard of safe and “may be effective,” rather than the more stringent standard of “proven to be safe and effective in adequately- controlled trials” required for traditional drug approval under section 505.b.1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”).

13



Participants were enrolled between May and December 2020 at 10 U.S. hospitals and followed through day 60. Six of these were classified as tertiary care hospitals. The primary endpoint was pre-specified by the FDA as “alive and free of respiratory failure” at day 60. Secondary endpoints included survival and duration of hospital stay in patients who recover.
In the Intravenous Trial, across all patients and sites, ZYESAMI did not meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint of time to recovery from respiratory failure by day 60 (P=.085) but did meet the secondary endpoint of survival at day 60, demonstrating a 2-fold increased odds of survival compared to placebo (P=.03). When controlling for type of hospital (community hospitals vs. tertiary care centers,) ZYESAMI demonstrated higher odds of recovering from respiratory failure at days 28 (P = .014) and 60 (P = .013) and also demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in likelihood of surviving to day 60 (P = <.001). The study did not demonstrate a statistically-significant difference on the primary endpoint without statistical adjustment for these pre-specified covariates.
Additionally, when controlling for ventilation status and treatment site, a significant advantage favoring ZYESAMI was seen (P=.018), with the largest effect in the subgroup of patients (n=98) treated by High Flow Nasal Cannula (“HFNC”), compared to those treated with mechanical or non-invasive ventilation at tertiary care hospitals. In this group, ZYESAMI patients had a 71% chance of successful recovery by day 28 vs. 48% in the placebo group (P=.017) and a 75% rate of successful recovery by day 60 vs. 55% in the placebo group (P=.036). 84% of HFNC patients treated at tertiary medical centers with ZYESAMI survived to day 60 compared with 60% of placebo patients (P=.007). The finding that patients fared substantially better in tertiary care centers as compared to regional hospitals may be influenced by the intensity of the public health crisis at the regional hospitals that participated in the Intravenous Trial, such centers may have been more resource constrained or faced with high occupancy in their ICUs, including implementation of temporary ICU beds, and shortages of critical care staff. As mentioned before, high ICU occupancy can be associated with higher mortality.
In reviewing our request for Breakthrough Therapy designation (“BTD”) which was denied, the FDA pointed out that BTD can only be awarded for an unmet medical need and that remdesivir is currently labeled for use in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. With that insight, we asked Prof. David Schoenfeld, one of the world’s most widely published statisticians with unique expertise in life-threatening diseases of the lung, to conduct an independent analysis of recovery and survival from respiratory failure in patients treated with ZYESAMI after treatment with remdesivir compared to those treated with placebo after treatment with remdesivir. That analysis determined that across all patients and sites of care, treatment with ZYESAMI was associated with a statistically-significant 3-fold increased odds of meeting the primary endpoint (recovery from respiratory failure) and 4-fold increased odds of survival at day 60 (P=.006).
In addition to the primary and secondary endpoints that will be key for Emergency Use Authorization and subsequent drug approval, ZYESAMI met two important secondary endpoints that could be supportive of those approvals and that may qualify ZYESAMI for accelerated approval as anticipated by the 21st Century Cures Act: Blood oxygenation as measured by Respiratory Distress Ratio (RDR) and IL-6 cytokine reduction.
RDR is measured as the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen partial pressure (FiO2). This ratio (PaO2/FiO2) is also known as the Horowitz index or PF ratio. As patients recover and leave the ICU, PF ratio can no longer be measured because arterial blood gas is no longer obtained. Over the first three days of therapy, however, PF ratio is obtained on the entire study cohort and provides an early indication of biologic response to aviptadil vs. placebo.
Mean RDR was comparable at baseline (aviptadil=112.1, placebo=105.2), with differentiating improvement noted at Day 2 pre-dose (aviptadil=124.6, placebo=107.8; two-sided t-test=0.12) and at Day 3 pre-dose (aviptadil=140.1, placebo=107.7; two-sided t=0.01). A sustained mean numeric advantage at Day 7 pre-dose was seen (aviptadil=139.2, placebo=116.2; two-sided p=0.11). For patients treated at baseline with HFNC, differentiating improvement was confirmed at Day 2 pre-dose (aviptadil=124.4, placebo=93.4; two-sided t=0.01), at Day 3 pre-dose (aviptadil=141.9, placebo=105.4; two-sided t=0.03), and at Day 7 (aviptadil=146.1, placebo=115.2; two-sided t=0.04).

14



Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) regression was used to determine whether higher mean RDR was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving the primary endpoint at 60 days. The higher mean RDR seen in aviptadil- vs. placebo-treated participants was predictive of achieving the primary endpoint on MMRM (F 16.0; P<.001).
This biologic effect of aviptadil on RDR is consistent with the improvement in RDR associated with aviptadil reported in the single-center, open-label trial conducted at Houston Methodist Hospital (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Respiratory Distress Ratio in patients treated with aviptadil and placebo. Significant differences in improvement are noted at days 1, 2, 3, and 7 (t-test P<.05) and across the 7-day interval on MMRM (P<.02).

Figure 2 (above left): Percent change from pre-treatment (Day 0) baseline in IL-6. A significant difference is seen between day 3 and day 7 favoring aviptadil (P=.024) with independent significance on days 3 (P=.002) and 7 (p=.06).
Figure 3 (above right): Predicted probability of primary outcome vs. change in Log IL-6 level from baseline to day 7. Increase in IL6 at day 7 predicted >50% of the variance in treatment outcome (R2- .53). Treatment with aviptadil is less likely to be associated with a day 7 increase in IL-6 and is associated with higher probability of primary endpoint success.
Among the subgroup of subjects for whom biomarker data were collected, treatment arm (p=.034) and baseline ventilation status (p=.019) were significant independent predictors of day 60 primary endpoint success, independent of any interaction effects (Figure 2). Type of hospital was not significantly associated with this biological effect. A lower level of IL-6 on Day 7 strongly predicted achieving the primary endpoint and survival at Day 60 (p<.0001) and was collinear with treatment-type (p=.95). Baseline ventilation status (p=.07) demonstrated a trend level of significance as a covariate in this model.

Prospective, administratively-controlled trial of ZYESAMI in highly comorbid patients with COVID-19 (High Comorbidity Open Label)
Youssef (2021) has reported on 21 consecutively admitted patients with Respiratory Failure in Critical COVID-19 and multiple co-morbidities, enrolled under Emergency Use INDs and an Expanded Access Protocol as detailed below. These patients were compared with 24 patients with comparable comorbidity from the same ICU, who were treated by the same clinical team during the same timeframe and who received maximal standard of care (“SOC”). All patients were treated with three successive 12-hour intravenous infusions of increasing doses of aviptadil (50/100/150 pmol/kg/hr). This initial 60 day-trial has now been updated to one year for the purpose of assessing survival. All enrolled patients were followed to one year and survival status was assessed either at a clinic visit or by telephone call initiated by the principal investigator.
Survival
By Kaplan-Meier lifetable analysis (Figure 4), aviptadil-treated patients were 3-fold more likely to survive over one year than were those treated with SOC (Hazard Ratio 0.26; 95% CL 0.12, 0.60). The difference is both dramatic and statistically significant (log rank test: P<.0001).

Figure 4: Survival in patients treated with aviptadil (n=21) vs SOC (n=24) from Time of ICU Admission (Hazard Ratio 0.26; 95% CL 0.12, 0.60)
Time to Recovery
Time to recovery from respiratory failure was similarly analyzed by life table analysis (Figure 5 Youssef et. al. 2021). Respiratory failure was defined by the FDA resource-based criterion (FDA 2021) of requirement for mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, or high flow nasal oxygen at 20L or greater. A similar 5.5-fold increase in the likelihood of recovery from respiratory failure from the time of ICU admission was seen (55% vs 10%; P=.002) at 60 days. The hazard ratio is 0.115 (95% CL: 0.0254, 0.5219).

Improvement on Respiratory Distress Ratio (PAO2:FiO2)
As was also demonstrated in the Phase IIb/III trial, Aviptadil-treated patients demonstrated a significant, nearly 3-fold improvement in oxygenation as measured by the Respiratory Distress Ratio (RDR), also known as the Pa02:FiO2 ratio. Control SOC patients demonstrated no significant mean improvement (164 (SD 134) vs. 3 (SD 86): P<.001) (Figure 6). 15 of 21 aviptadil-treated patients demonstrated a 100- point or greater improvement in RDR, compared to 4 of 30 controls (P<0.001). No aviptadil-treated patient demonstrated significant worsening in blood oxygenation, whereas 5 control patients demonstrated a decrement of 100 points or greater (P<.05). The improvement in patients on ECMO was similar to that seen in patients treated with conventional mechanical ventilation. Available data from blood gases showed clear increases in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio after the second dose (median increase = 92.5, IQR = 74) and at 24 hours after the third dose (median increase over baseline = 84.5, IQR = 110). A statistically significant difference in mean improvement is seen in aviptadil-treated patients vs. controls (164 vs. 3: P<.001).
Subsequent follow-up reveals that 7 additional aviptadil-treated patients returned either to home or long- term acute care for a total of 17 (81%), and 1 additional patient has died. In contrast, 2 additional control patients have died, and the remaining 2 were continuing on mechanical ventilation at 60 days. Thus, from a post-hoc perspective, aviptadil-treated patients with Critical COVID-19 were eight times more likely to return to home or long-term care than were patients given SOC.

Changes on Radiographic Appearance
Radiographic evidence (Figure 7) on a subgroup of patients from our first clinical study is currently undergoing formal evaluation by a panel of blinded experts. Full or partial resolution of the “ground glass” parenchymal changes associated with COVID-19 pneumonitis occurred in 17 of 21 aviptadil-treated patients.

Changes in inflammatory markers
A laboratory panel of inflammatory markers, including LDH, troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-Dimer, and IL-6 was obtained prior to and post treatment with aviptadil (Figure 8). In all patients, improvement can be seen on each of the inflammatory markers. The largest average percent decrease was seen in C-reactive protein (76% ±3%) and IL- (75% ±3%). No patient demonstrated an increase in any of the inflammatory markers. Because of the high mortality rate in the control group, an accurate comparison in cytokine reduction between aviptadil-treated and standard-of-care patients is not feasible.

ZYESAMI inclusion in NIH ACTIV3b/TESICO Clinical Trial for Critical COVID-19 and Respiratory Failure (ACTIV3b / TESICO)
Based on the above research, the NIH selected ZYESAMI for further study. Dr. Francis Collins, then Director of the NIH gave a public presentation on September 21, 2021 in which he identified ZYESAMI as having been selected from among 600 candidate compounds and identified it as one of a handful of compounds still under study for critically-ill patients.
ZYESAMI was selected by the steering committee of the Therapeutics for Severely Ill Inpatients with COVID-19 (“TESICO”) protocol funded by Operation Warp Speed through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease of the NIH. The protocol is part of the NIH Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (“ACTIV”) public private consortium. This clinical trial anticipates enrolling 640 patients in study sites located in the U.S., the EU, the UK, and Brazil in a factorial design that will compare ZYESAMI to placebo and to Veklury (Remdesivir) both alone and in combination with ZYESAMI for the treatment of critical COVID-19 with respiratory failure. The TESICO trial recruited its first patient in April 2021.
As of March 15, 2022, approximately 465 participants have been randomized in the TESICO trial.
ZYESAMI inclusion in I-SPY Clinical Trial for severe and critical COVID-19 with early or impending respiratory failure (I-SPY)
We signed a contract with Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative for the inclusion of ZYESAMI in the I-SPY clinical trial platform, whereby inhaled ZYESAMI was included as part of a panel of four drugs being tested as part of the I-SPY COVID-19 Trial, an adaptive platform trial for critically ill patients. After enrolling and dosing approximately 52 patients with inhaled ZYESAMI in the clinical trial, I-SPY determined that continued administration of ZYESAMI as a nebulized agent for this patient population who are receiving high flow nasal oxygen (6 liters or more) would be futile and has discontinued the study. Patients enrolled in this study were mostly Severe or Critical, and rapidly progressing. This program was targeted at exploring another route of administration for this mostly advanced patient population that could potentially expand the use of ZYESAMI beyond our intravenous route of administration. This futility is most likely driven by the challenges of delivering nebulized medication via mouthpiece to critically ill patients receiving high flow oxygen support (6 liters or more) because the turbulence generated by high-flow oxygen prevents sufficient levels of the drug inhaled by mouth from reaching the lungs, although other factors may also play a role. Administration of inhaled ZYESAMI in populations not on high flow nasal oxygen support (not critical or severe) hence continues to be an area of interest for us. Accordingly, NRx plans to focus on intravenous ZYESAMI in future trials of patients who are rapidly progressing and/or requiring higher levels of oxygen that cannot be reduced, e.g., Critical COVID-19.

20



Phase IIb/III Clinical Trial for Inhaled ZYESAMI in Early COVID-19 (AVICOVID-2)
Although our initial focus has been on the use of ZYESAMI in patients with critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure (i.e., patients who require ventilation, extracorporeal oxygenation, or high flow nasal oxygen to survive), we received permission from the FDA to test inhaled ZYESAMI in patients with earlier disease. We believe that inhaled drug could reach the ATII cells in the lung better than the intravenous drug, provided patients are still able to inhale normally and do not have inflammatory debris clogging the alveoli. Enrollment for this study of patients with Severe COVID-19 commenced in January 2021. Enrollment in this trial has been paused to review safety and feasibility of this trial in the Severely ill inpatient population. The trial was originally sized and study power calculated based on the assumption that a high proportion of Severely ill patients with COVID-19 would progress to Critical COVID-19 and/or require ICU admission. With advances in the treatment of COVID-19 and a potentially milder strain becoming the dominant strain of COVID-19, it appears that now fewer patients admitted to the hospital with Severe COVID-19 progress to Critical COVID-19 and/or require ICU admission. After having enrolled approximately 40% of the initially targeted number of patients, we are now evaluating the best path forward for this study. Continuing this trial as configured would now likely require a sample size in excess of 600 patients to determine a statistically significant difference on this endpoint (i.e., ICU admission). This inpatient study has been paused while NRx evaluates whether to increase the sample size to this level or change the trial endpoint and possibly enrollment criteria or discontinue this study and focus the nebulized use of ZYESAMI in other patient populations.
Safety of ZYESAMI in treating COVID-19
In each of the intravenous studies described above, the dosing of ZYESAMI specified 3 successive days of one daily 12-hour infusion with escalating doses of 50/100/150 picomol/kg/hr from day 1 to day 3. The treatment emergent adverse event profile indicates that ZYESAMI is a drug that can be safely used for Critical COVID-19 patients in the context of critical case settings. The two most frequent side effects that have emerged are diarrhea (in approximately 1/3 of patients, which was significantly more frequent in the ZYESAMI group) and hypotension. ZYESAMI may cause hypotension, which is also frequently seen in critically-ill patients with COVID-19 and other disorders in the ICU, e.g., sepsis. However, hypotension is routinely managed in the intensive care unit with drugs (pressors) that raise blood pressure. ZYESAMI is not recommended in patients whose hemodynamic profile is critically low and unstable (e.g., Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) cannot be maintained above 65 with a single pressor agent). Within those limitations, hypotension was seen in 26% of patients treated with ZYESAMI, compared to 21% of patients treated with placebo in our study – a difference that was not statistically significant. No safety signals were identified by the NRx Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) during the NRx clinical trial or expanded access program and thus far, the NIH-sponsored TESICO DSMB has identified no new safety signals following enrollment of approximately 465 patients as of March 15, 2022. Similarly, no new safety signals were identified in the Expanded Access or Right to Try programs.
Extensive nonclinical and human safety data are in IND 149,152 and have been reviewed by the FDA. In pre- EUA meetings, the FDA has noted that toxicology data on file are sufficient for drug approval (REF ID 4650082). In brief, no specific toxicities have been identified across 4 nonclinical species and no lethal dose of VIP is identified in large mammals.

​
 As of March 15, 2022 across the clinical, expanded access and Right to Try programs, we estimate more than 850 patients with COVID-19 had been dosed with ZYESAMI. Of these, we estimate over 750 patients with Critical COVID-19 received at least one intravenous infusion of ZYESAMI. Such patients were being treated in ICUs or within a critical care setting. Physicians and other healthcare personnel were briefed on the use of the drug and the potential for adverse reactions of hypotension and diarrhea. Overall, the safety profile of ZYESAMI has been generally consistent across studies and has been manageable in a critical care setting.
Clinical Trials of Aviptadil in other lung conditions
Aviptadil’s mechanism is promising to help address other lung diseases, including Acute Respiratory Distress (“ARDS”) that is not due to COVID, and other acute and non-acute lung conditions. ARDS accounts for about 200,000 cases in the US. Clinical trials of aviptadil in preparations not formulated by NRx have been conducted and reported by others and are documented in the aviptadil Investigational Medicinal Products Dossier (“IMPD”). We are optimistic that the inhaled form of the drug may show benefit in other lung conditions as well. Phase II studies conducted in the 2008-time frame demonstrated statistically and clinically-significant benefits in the treatment of Sarcoidosis and brief changes in pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. Although initial trials in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis failed, we intend to further explore treatment of both pulmonary and cystic fibrosis. In addition, we intend to explore other acute and/or chronic lung injury diseases.
ZYESAMI (Aviptadil) Mechanism of Action
Understanding the mechanism of VIP involves a basic understanding of how the lung transmits oxygen from the air to the blood and carbon dioxide from the blood back to the air. The large airways of the lung (bronchi) branch into smaller units (bronchioles), finally ending in miniscule sacs (alveoli) where oxygenation happens. Alveoli are only able to stay open
22



because they are lined with a detergent-like fluid called surfactant and it is the surface tension of this fluid that allows alveoli to stay open, just like the detergent in a soap bubble allows a miniscule drop of water to maintain its structure. Without surfactant, the lung is incapable of oxygenating, causing a lethal condition called “Respiratory Distress.”
Copyright © 2020: NeuroRx, Inc., all rights reserved
Surfactant is produced by a small population of cells that comprise only 5% of the lining of the lung, called “Alveolar Type II” (“ATII”) cells. These ATII cells nourish the 95% of the lung cells that are largely passive in their function. ATII cells are specifically targeted by the coronavirus because they have a specific receptor on their surface (“ACE2”) that binds to the spike of the virus. Once the virus binds to the ACE2-receptor, it enters the cell, takes over the nucleus of the cell and makes millions of copies of itself. The virus causes the cell to make inflammatory cytokines, which have lethal effects throughout the body. The virus ultimately causes the cell to rupture (cytopathy), thus releasing millions of virus particles that go on to infect more ATII cells and other cells elsewhere in the body.
VIP’s potential mechanism may be uniquely targeted to protect the ATII cell. Every species of mammal makes an identical form of VIP, suggesting that it has been essential for protecting the lung throughout evolution. In animal models, VIP protects the lung against smoke injury, against acid and other caustic chemicals, and against various infections. It does so by binding to a specific receptor on the ATII cell (“VPAC1”). In the context of the coronavirus, as illustrated in a manuscript by Jonathan Javitt and Jihad G. Youssef, VIP blocks the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the ATII cell and the production of cytokines, prevents cell death and increases the cell’s production of surfactant.

23



VIP in detail
As life evolved from aquatic to terrestrial environments, the respiratory epithelium — responsible for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide — was required to adapt from contact with a nontoxic aqueous environment to constant contact with atmospheric gasses that are rapidly toxic to epithelial cells. This was achieved via the development of a surfactant layer that lines the air sacs of the lung and both protects the pulmonary epithelium from direct exposure to air while simultaneously maintaining patency of the air sac by creating the biological equivalent of a soap bubble inside each alveolus. The surfactant layer is maintained entirely by the ATII cell and dysfunction or death of this cell population rapidly leads to alveolar collapse. Indeed, the first pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are characterized by a ground glass appearance on chest x-ray, indicative of alveolar collapse accompanied by blood oxygen desaturation, well before the lung begins to fill with inflammatory transudates and debris.
COVID-19 pneumonitis and respiratory failure is caused by selective attack of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on ATII cells via their ACE2 surface receptors which are not present in alveolar type I cells (Figure 9). ATII cells occupy just 5% of the pulmonary lining but produce all of the surfactant required to maintain surface tension and achieve oxygenation. Viral replication triggers cytokine production and cytopathy (cell rupture), thus unleashing a lethal “cytokine storm.” Conventional anti-cytokine (particularly anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody “mAb”) drugs have only shown limited ability to absorb this cytokine load once produced, which is a possible explanation for their limited efficacy and in advanced forms of COVID-19.
The pleomorphic role of VIP in protecting the lung
Although named “Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide,” 70% of VIP is concentrated in the human lung, where it plays a number of protective roles. VIP has been conserved throughout evolution such that all mammals make VIP and there are no known variants. VIP plays a key role in human response to both inflammatory and caustic challenges to epithelium, particularly the pulmonary epithelium. The role of VIP in preventing or mitigating numerous forms of experimental lung injury is extensively documented and human trials have demonstrated an effect of VIP in treating ARDS related to sepsis, pulmonary Sarcoidosis, Pulmonary Hypertension, and various forms of asthma/allergy.
VIP binds to ATII cells via the VPAC1 surface receptor. Its pharmacokinetics are short-lived. Recent data from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro Brazil showed that VIP inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected human Calu-3 cells and monocytes. VIP significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, achieving 33% and 45% inhibition at 5 nM and 10 nM, respectively (Figure 10). VIP at 1 nM completely blocked the SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytopathic effect, as measured by LDH levels in the cell culture supernatant.
Conditioned media from infected monocytes treated with VIP was administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells and resulted in a 50% reduction of virus replication in these cells. This finding suggests that VIP induced monocytes to release antiviral factors which may increase the resistance of neighboring cells to SARS-CoV-2 growth.

Inhibition of Cytokine Synthesis: There is an extensive literature on the role of VIP in blocking cytokine synthesis in the ATII cell and VIP is shown to reduce production of TNFα in both ARDS and Sarcoid. Infected monocytes and Calu-3 cells produce large amounts of IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and MIF relative to uninfected cells (15,4,12, and 18 times more). Treatment with VIP resulted in 66%, 50%, 66%, and 50% reduction (respectively) in those proinflammatory cytokines in vitro, implying that VIP may offer critical protection to inflamed lungs infected by the coronavirus. As noted above, morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is widely believed to be associated with release of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6. Across all patients and sites of care in our study, those treated with placebo showed a ten-fold increase in blood IL-6 levels within  days of treatment, while those treated with ZYESAMI showed a 2-fold increase (P<.02). Preventing this rise in IL-6 was statistically correlated with improved survival in ZYESAMI- treated patients (P<.0001).
Preservation of Surfactant: If the mechanism of acute lung injury (“ALI”) in SARS-CoV-2 infection was driven by cytokine-induced inflammation alone, steroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs might be expected to have some salutary effect. Lung injuries seen in COVID-19 are increasingly recognized as similar to those in premature infants where loss of surfactant, secreted by ATII cells leads to demise of premature infants despite mechanical ventilation. VIP increases the incorporation of methyl-choline into phosphatidylcholine — the major component of pulmonary surfactant — by enhancing the activity of the enzyme choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase.

Inhibition of Cytopathy: In addition to empirical observations that VIP blocks coronavirus-induced cytopathy, there is substantial literature which demonstrates that VIP is a proven inhibitor of activation-induced perforin, as well as of granzyme B and therefore actively contributes to the reduction of deleterious proinflammatory and cell death-inducing processes, particularly in the lungs. Caspase-3, has been identified as a key mediator of apoptosis in mammalian cells via its role in cleaving a variety of substrate proteins and inducing DNA fragmentation. In animal models of ALI, caspase activity is significantly increased compared to its activity in normal lungs and VIP is shown to suppress caspase activation.
Supporting Data Suggestive of Biological Effect
​
Phase I and II Clinical Data on the use of VIP in Pulmonary Disease
A Phase I study in patients with ARDS related to sepsis, a condition associated with high mortality and/or complications, demonstrated clinical improvement in seven of eight patients and long-term survival in six (with the seventh dying from an unrelated myocardial infarction). Additionally, there were meaningful reductions in circulating TNF-α and improvement in blood oxygenation while on ventilator (Youssef et. al. 2021).
Following this acute care finding in Phase I, the sponsor at the time (Biogen) elected to focus on chronic lung disease and initiated Phase II human studies in sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Substantial reduction in cough and dyspnea was documented in sarcoidosis with inhaled aviptadil four times daily. A significant reduction in TNF-α, release from bronchial washing T cells was measured, along with a statistically significant reduction in CD4/CD8 ratio, a well-accepted measurement of immune response. Intravenous safety data is detailed in the IMPD and is on file with the FDA.
In brief, the No Adverse Effect Level as accepted by the FDA is 200μg/kg/day. The doses of aviptadil contemplated in this study are less than 10μg/kg/day, yielding a 20x threshold between the contemplated dose and the lowest possible toxic dose. The IMPD documents numerous safety studies in normal volunteers and efficacy studies in aviptadil, showing that aviptadil has the potential to lower blood pressure and to cause diarrhea, both of which may be dose limiting side effects in some patients but are readily managed in an ICU / critical care setting.
Human Case-Control Study of VIP Association with COVID-19 Survival
Plasma levels of VIP are elevated in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, compared to normal controls and elevation in VIP is correlated with severity of COVID-19 inflammation (r2 0.16; P<.01; Figure 11, Temerozo 2020) A case-control study was undertaken at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro in 25 patients with critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure. VIP levels were correlated in survivors (n=12) vs. non-survivors (n=13) of those who received maximal intensive care with ventilation COVID-19 respiratory failure. A significantly higher level of VIP is documented among survivors (P<.05).

Non-Clinical Safety Studies of Aviptadil Overview
We were granted rights to toxicology, clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics data assessed in humans and in four other species by Relief Therapeutics. These nonclinical data have been deemed by the FDA in written communication to be sufficient to support an NDA.
Relief Therapeutics’ predecessor company, Mondo Biotech, undertook development of aviptadil in partnership with Biogen and took joint advice from the FDA and EMEA. Three Type B meetings were conducted with the FDA between 2006 and 2010, which resulted in a complete package of nonclinical studies produced in four species (mice, rats, dogs, and primates) to support intravenous and inhaled use of aviptadil. Those studies, which have been filed under FDA IND 149,152 include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology (cardiovascular), acute toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and local tolerance. The FDA has agreed in writing that all NDA-clearing non-clinical studies have been performed and has agreed to accept the non-clinical data on a rolling basis in advance of clinical safety and efficacy data.
Source and Manufacture of Drug Substance
Our initial source of drug substance for ZYESAMI of aviptadil was supplied by Bachem Americas (Torrance, CA). A Drug Master File (DMF)has been established with the FDA by Bachem Americas to which we have been granted Right of Reference. We contracted with Bachem Americas to supply 1 KG of aviptadil during the first quarter of 2021. We have additionally contracted with the Polypeptide Group to supply aviptadil. The Polypeptide Group’s material has not yet been qualified by the FDA for human use and this qualification is anticipated as part of our NDA for ZYESAMI. We have contracted with the Polypeptide Group for 7 KG of aviptadil and, as of the date of this annual report, 4 KG have been released to us.
On October 8, 2021, the Company submitted an updated manufacturing module to its IND that contained documentation confirming that Nephron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is in a position to provide commercial supply of ZYESAMI. On November 8, 2021, the FDA communicated with the Company that the manufacturing update had been reviewed and that no “clinical hold” items had been identified (this is the regulatory language that allows an investigational product to be given to patients). This module will now be used as part of the FDA’s rolling review process supporting a potential NDA for ZYESAMI.
In November 2021, the Company announced receipt of the FDA’s response to NRx’s October 8, 2021 submission of updated manufacturing information for ZYESAMI. The completion of this review, without the imposition of any clinical hold by the FDA, enables NRx to distribute ZYESAMI, produced at commercial scale, under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for clinical trials and other future purposes approved in future regulatory actions. NRx will continue working with the FDA to complete the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) review that will ultimately be required for any potential drug approval.
The Company has initiated a parallel manufacturing process to provide a second source of supply in the US and to conform to EU and UK standards. In October 2021, the Company announced that a European Qualified Person (“QP”) audit was conducted, and no major deficiencies were identified, thus clearing ZYESAMI’s use in EU investigational programs. NRx is awaiting a QP Declaration that is required by the EU regulatory authorities for the release of ZYESAMI as an investigational drug in Europe. The audit was completed in preparation for submission of European Union (EU)-standard ZYESAMI to EU and United Kingdom health regulatory authorities. Under EU law, a QP Auditor is responsible for certifying that each batch of a medicinal product meets all required provisions when released from a manufacturing facility within the EU or imported into the EU.
Basis for Formulation and Initial Stability
Originally, aviptadil was supplied in normal saline for human use and, in this form, has demonstrated clinical benefit in open-label studies (Figure 12). The inventor, Dorian Bevec, MD, a former consultant to our Company, led the inhaled 

27



use trials for sarcoidosis, asthma/allergy, and pulmonary hypertension, and observed the intravenous Phase I trial. However, the lyophilized formulation that includes Polysorbate 80, sucrose, and mannitol is believed to result in peptide aggregation and was abandoned by Mondo Biotech in 2009. Addition of citrate buffer and EDTA causes decreased potency and purity by 28 weeks.
Figure 12: Purity and potency of aviptadil in saline vs buffer systems over 18 months
Bachem’s stress test data on aviptadil stated that aviptadil in saline is stable for at least 77 weeks at 5°C. These data were not successfully replicated by NRx using modern, validated chromatography techniques at two different cGMP manufacturers. In January 2021, we advised Relief Therapeutics that we were abandoning Relief’s original formulation approach and embarking on a new approach in conjunction with Nephron Pharmaceuticals and Nextar, Ltd. in order to develop a long-term stable liquid formulation of ZYESAMI.
Future approaches to manufacturing and delivery of ZYESAMI
Although we believe that we have created viable approaches to the delivery of ZYESAMI suitable for intravenous use, we continue to search for additional approaches that will render ZYESAMI more convenient for patients, including inhaled use in an outpatient setting. On August 2, 2021 we announced a development relationship with Mannkind, Inc. (“MNKD”) under which we will explore the use of MNKD’s Technosphere® platform for the formulation of ZYESAMI. This platform has successfully been implemented to develop an FDA-approved form of inhaled insulin (Afrezza®) that is currently marketed in the U.S. and globally.
Digital Health Solutions for decentralized clinical trials of ZYESAMI
During the COVID pandemic, conduct of clinical trials evolved to include rapidly deployable capabilities to remotely manage challenges associated with traditional in-person monitoring, study site management and patient monitoring. As we contemplate future trials of inhaled ZYESAMI in the outpatient setting, we require solutions that track patient use of our inhaled medication. In addition, the Company expanded its digital technology capabilities to encompass remote tracking of pulse oxymetry after nebulized delivery of medication via the Company’s contract with PillTracker Ltd., a related party.
CNS Product Portfolio: Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in Bipolar Disorder
Background of the CNS Portfolio
Our CNS portfolio is based upon fundamental scientific discoveries of Daniel Javitt, MD, PhD, a Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University and co-founder of NRx. In 1987, Daniel Javitt discovered the role of blocking the brain’s NMDA receptor (a molecule on the surface of brain cells) in producing psychosis. The discovery was made in the context of attempting to determine the molecular mechanism by which phencyclidine (angel dust: a once popular drug of abuse frequently added to cannabis) caused acute psychosis in a high proportion of users. Daniel Javitt discovered that phencyclidine exerted its psychotogenic action by blocking the NMDA receptor and devoted the balance of his ongoing career to studying the brain chemistry of schizophrenia, depression, and related disorders. Daniel Javitt is one of the most widely published scientists in molecular psychiatry.
About 10 years after Daniel Javitt’s original discovery, it was learned that NMDA inhibition is the mechanism by which ketamine, dextromethorphan, and other NMDA antagonists exert their antidepressant effects. Daniel Javitt 

28



subsequently made the seminal observation that when an NMDA antagonist, specifically DCS, is combined with a traditional (serotonin-targeted) antidepressant or antipsychotic, the two drugs have a synergistic effect wherein antidepressant activity is enhanced and side effects are decreased. Daniel Javitt explicated the mechanism of this synergy in multiple non-clinical models. The discovery has led to a broad patent portfolio now owned by us and to the development of NRX-101, the first investigational drug specifically targeting bipolar depression with suicidality.
NMDAR-based treatment for bipolar depression
NRX-101 is a dual-targeted sequential therapy regimen (the “NRx Pharmaceuticals Sequential Therapy”) consisting of an initial treatment with NRX-100 (intravenous ketamine) followed by 6-week treatment with NRX-101 (combined DCS and lurasidone). The treatment is intended for rapid stabilization of individuals with acute suicidal ideation and behavior related to acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms in individuals with bipolar disorder, followed by longer term stabilization to permit resolution of the crisis. The drug is intended for treatment of both depression and acute suicidal ideation and behavior (“ASIB”) in individuals with an acute depressive decompensation in bipolar disorder.
Background on the indication
Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depressive disorder, is a well-established psychiatric diagnosis. According to the NIH, an estimated 2.8% of the US adult population had bipolar disorder in the past 12 months, and the lifetime prevalence is 4.4% of adults in the U.S. The risk of ASIB is uniquely high in patients during bipolar depressive episodes, compared to those with MDD, thought disorders, and personality disorders. Lifetime suicide behavior occurs in 25% to 56% of people with bipolar depression. It is possible that a significant portion of the approximately 46,000 deaths in 2020 from suicide in the U.S. were associated with bipolar depression. Substance abuse is high in this population and death due to drug overdoses are generally not counted as suicides. Furthermore, according to the CDC, the COVID-19 pandemic increased many of the risk factors for suicide. Patients with bipolar depression are 20-30 times more likely to attempt suicide than the general population. Some epidemiological study data suggests that over the course of 5 years, approximately 1 in 5 patients suffering from bipolar depression may attempt suicide or have serious thoughts about attempting suicide. The overall rate of death by suicide among bipolar patients is approximately 10-30 fold greater than that of the general population. Those who have attempted suicide are at significantly higher risk to experience another suicide attempt or die by suicide. Thus, ASIB in bipolar depression has uniquely lethal clinical characteristics.
Current Treatment Options for ASIB in Bipolar Depression
Despite its lethal characteristics, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for patients with ASIB in bipolar depression. As a result, ECT, often combined with inpatient psychiatric care, remains the only FDA-approved treatment for patients with ASIB in bipolar depression, despite ECT’s well-documented side effects that include memory loss and confusion, along with its high cost. In recent years, several combined D2/5-HT2a antagonists have been shown to have efficacy in treating bipolar depression (olanzapine/ fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, and lurasidone) with treatment guidelines endorsing common use as first-line standard-of-care treatment in acute bipolar depression. While these medications are effective at reducing overall symptoms of depression, they do not specifically reduce suicidal ideation, and may potentially increase the risk of suicide. In the two bipolar depression registration studies of lurasidone, individuals with active suicidal ideation were specifically excluded because of concerns regarding the possibility of exacerbating suicidality. Similarly, acutely suicidal patients are routinely excluded from clinical trials of other experimental anti-depressive agents. Thus, ASIB in bipolar depression represents a major unmet medical need that must frequently be treated with voluntary or involuntary hospitalization under highly supervised conditions and in some cases the use of ECT.
Whereas all approved drugs for depression act primarily through monoaminergic mechanisms, the serendipitous discovery that ketamine can have a rapid and profound effect on depression and suicidality led to the realization that the glutamate system and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (“NMDAR”) may also play an important role in depression and suicidality. In our Phase IIb/III registrational study, acutely suicidal and depressed bipolar patients will receive a single low dose of IV ketamine to determine clinical response. Patients who respond with an acute improvement of suicidality and depressive symptoms to ketamine (NRX-100), in a separate study will receive NRX-101 orally twice daily for up to six 

29



weeks to determine if NRX-101 may prolong the resolution of depressive symptoms and time to clinical relapse versus lurasidone.
Rationale for Developing NRX Sequential Treatment
NRX-100, an IV infusion of ketamine to induce acute response, is taken in conjunction with NRX-101, a fixed-dose combination oral capsule composed of DCS and lurasidone to maintain remission from acute suicidality in acutely depressed bipolar patients. Congruent with our strategy of applying innovative science to known molecules, the NRx Sequential Therapy takes advantage of the unique synergistic confluence of three FDA-approved drugs with long histories of safety: DCS, lurasidone and ketamine.
DCS is a broad-spectrum antibiotic approved for the treatment of tuberculosis (Seromycin, or Cycloserine). DCS has been used in millions of patients and has a well known safety profile. Its antidepressant effects were first noted as a serendipitous observation in individuals with co-morbid tuberculosis and depression receiving high-dose DCS treatment for anti-tuberculosis therapy and subsequently confirmed in a prospective investigation. However, these were not pursued further at the time because of the liability of DCS to induce significant psychotomimetic side effects when given at high dose. The interaction of DCS with the NMDA receptor was first demonstrated in 1989, leading to some interest in NMDAR blockers as potential antidepressant treatments. For example, both DCS and the related compound ACPC were shown to be active in mice, using the forced swim test for depression.
High-dose (>500 mg) DCS was subsequently shown to reduce persistent depressive symptoms in patients with MDD despite adequate treatment with approved antidepressant agents. A slow DCS titration was used, with 250 mg/dX3 days, followed by 500 mg/d for 18 days (i.e., until end of week 3); followed by 750 mg/day for 1 week (i.e., until end of week 4), followed by 1000 mg/day (i.e., until end of study). In the study (Figure 13), significant beneficial effects were observed in 13 subjects vs. placebo control with SSRI- nonresponsive depressive symptoms. The improvements were manifest within two weeks and persisted throughout the six-week treatment period. These data suggest a >0.9 effect size. Statistical separation between groups was observed by end of week 4, i.e., within 1 week of initiation of a dose >500 mg/day. An unexpected finding of the study was that psychotomimetic effects of combined DCS and antidepressants were minimal, suggesting unexpected synergy between the two components of the treatment.
Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic with approval for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar depression in adults and pediatric patients (10-17 years old) as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate in adults.
Ketamine HCl is a dissociative, rapid-acting general anesthetic for intravenous or intramuscular injection, approved for surgical anesthesia. Ketamine has been shown in multiple randomized clinical trials the potential to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms and also suicidal ideation. However, the clinical effect has been demonstrated to diminish three to seven days post-dose when used intravenously and two days post-dose when the S-enantiomer is delivered intranasally. Ketamine is classified as a schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act, due to its potential for addiction.
Whereas ketamine is a direct NMDA channel blocker, which binds to the phencyclidine binding site, DCS in high doses has an NMDA-antagonist effect mediated through interaction with the glycine binding site. This effect is apparently unrelated to its properties as an anti-infective. By combining the potential of DCS to extend the anti-depressant effects of ketamine with the antipsychotic properties of lurasidone, the NRx Pharmaceuticals Sequential Therapy has the potential to stabilize individuals with bipolar depression during acute crisis and address a serious medical need.
Ketamine HCl, infused at 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes has been shown to induce acute reductions in suicidality and depression in patients with bipolar depression, relative to control. Numerous reports have documented approximately a 50% reduction in the MADRS and up to a 75% reduction in suicidality following a single infusion of ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation and depression. While the long-term repeat use of ketamine for psychiatric indications may be concerning to some, DCS, when combined with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (“SSRI”) antidepressants in patients with treatment resistant depression, and when combined with atypical antipsychotics, in particular lurasidone, has shown separation from control and ability to maintain remission from suicidality and depression over 6 weeks with oral use.

Preclinical observations
Cross-species translation of DCS effects is based upon plasma level, such that NMDAR antagonist effects are observed consistently at plasma levels >25 μg/ml (~250 μM). This plasma level is achieved in rodents with doses >30 mg/kg and in humans with doses >10 mg/kg. Evidence for functional target engagement at these doses comes from 1) rodent behavioral studies, 2) clinical studies of DCS in schizophrenia, and 3) clinical studies of DCS in depression.
Effects of DCS on NMDAR activation were first evaluated in 1990 by Hood et al., 1989 who noted inhibition of NMDAR activation by DCS at doses similar to our proposed active dose. These effects were subsequently confirmed by Watson et al., 1990, and the issue of high-dose antagonist effects of DCS were extensively discussed by Lanthorn et al., 1994.
The majority of rodent behavioral studies conducted with DCS used doses of DCS of 30 mg/kg produced significant dose-dependent anxiolytic effects in the fear-potentiated startle assay that were similar to those produced by the known NMDAR glycine-site antagonist 7-chlorokynurenate. The authors state as follows: “…the results of the present study show that D-cycloserine exhibits anxiolytic activity at higher doses, an effect consistent with antagonist activity,” and also argue for potential effectiveness of DCS in treatment of anxiety- and fear-related disorders including generalized anxiety disorder or PTSD.
NRX-101 Safety
Figure 14: Rodent neurotoxicity study showing “Olney lesions” induced by the NMDAR channel blocker MK-801 (light green regions). No significant neurotoxicity was observed for DCS.
A major concern with use of agents that block the channel site of the NMDAR is their propensity to induce neurotoxicity within frontal brain regions (“Olney lesions”) with extended or higher levels of exposure. This propensity for neurotoxicity has been observed with direct channel-blocking NMDAR agents, but has not been observed with any glycine-site modulator, such as NRX-101. The concern regarding neurotoxicity has caused the FDA to issue new guidance for the development of NMDAR-targeted antidepressants, requiring neurotoxicity studies, according to FDA-agreed protocols. This element of NMDAR-targeted antidepressant use may become increasingly relevant in coming years, because drugs containing ketamine and dextromethorphan, two molecules with known neurotoxic potential in humans have been proposed for repeated administration in the treatment of depression.
We took advice from the FDA in 2016 and conducted a rodent neurotoxicity study according to a protocol agreed in advance between the FDA and NRx Pharmaceuticals. The combination of the drugs for the NRx Pharmaceuticals Sequential Therapy (DCS, lurasidone, and ketamine) were tested according to this protocol and found to have no evidence of neurotoxicity (Figure 14) demonstrating safety factors of 4-fold, 16-fold and 7.4-fold for ketamine, DCS, and lurasidone, respectively. Each of the proposed drugs has a long history of safe use in humans, and their adverse event profiles are well characterized.

Inc.
Direct channel-blocking NMDAR-targeted antidepressants have shown substantial propensity for addiction and abuse liability, a propensity that has not been seen with glycine site modulators. This propensity may be related to theories that have been advanced indicating that such agents also bind to opiate receptors. DCS has also been investigated in a drug-abuse liability assay using intravenous self-administration. Both ketamine and S-ketamine are known to have significant abuse liability and support self-administration in rodents. Substantial abuse liability is also known in association with dextromethorphan. We conducted a rodent abuse liability study in which, the relative abilities of ketamine, S-ketamine and DCS to support self-administration were investigated in animals trained to self-administer ketamine (Figure 15). As expected, both ketamine (gray bar) and S-ketamine (yellow bar) significantly replaced ketamine, consistent with high clinical abuse potential. DCS did not significantly replace ketamine in this assay, consistent with lack of reported clinical abuse despite >50 years of clinical use.
NRx Pharmaceuticals Sequential Therapy (NRX-100 Followed by NRX-101) for the Treatment of Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in Bipolar Depression: the STABIL-B Study
An initial study was conducted to confirm the selected dosing levels for DCS and lurasidone and evaluate the NRx Pharmaceuticals Sequential Therapy approach. The study enrolled patients with severe bipolar depression and acute suicidal ideation and behavior. Severe depressive symptoms are defined as a score of 30 or higher on the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (“BISS”) derived MADRS score (“BDM”). Active suicidal intent with or without plan, but requiring hospitalization, was defined as a score of 4 or 5 using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (“C-SSRS”). In Stage 1, all subjects received treatment with a blinded infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. Response to Stage 1 was defined as 25% improvement in BDM, and C-SSRS 3 or less. Responders to Stage 1 were entered into a 6-week double-blind comparison study of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone alone. The objective of the study was to demonstrate significant superiority of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone alone for maintenance of improvement and prevention of relapse following initial successful IV ketamine treatment.
Dosing: Target doses were used of 950 mg for DCS and 66 mg for lurasidone. Both compounds were titrated upwards over the initial 5-d of treatment. Flexible dosing was permitted to allow dose reduction for side effects, or dose increases for agitation.
Endpoints: The primary endpoint consisted of relative change in BDM score between NRX-101 and lurasidone. Secondary endpoints included suicidality, as reflect in both C-SSRS score and clinician-rated global suicidality impression score (“CGI-SS”) and relapse.
Study results:
Stage 1: 22 subjects entered Stage 1. 17 were assigned to IV ketamine (NRX-100) and 5 to saline. All subjects showed significant response to treatment and were entered into Stage 2.
Stage 2: Data were analyzed for the 17 subjects who responded to IV ketamine in Stage 1. These subjects were randomized to either NRX-101 (n=12) or lurasidone alone (n=5). Sequential treatment with ketamine/NRX-101 significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to sequential treatment with ketamine/lurasidone alone (p=.032) in a last-observation carried forward (“LOCF”) analysis. In a parallel MMRM analysis, a statistical difference of p=.09 was observed between groups. In addition, there were no relapses during NRX-101 treatment (0/12, 0%) vs. 2 relapses 

32



in the lurasidone alone group (2/5, 40%). The between-group significance level of p=.0735 was not significant but showed feasibility of detecting a difference with larger samples given a similar response pattern.
In LOCF analyses of secondary endpoints, a significant between-group difference was also observed both for C-SSRS (p=.02) and for CGI-SS (p=.019). These findings suggest clinically noticeable between-group differences in liability for return of suicidality following initial ketamine treatment. Both effects were non-significant (p =.11; p=.15) on MMRM analysis.
Figure 16: Change in depression score during Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the STABIL-B study. All subjects improved significantly in Stage 1. In Stage 2, subjects assigned to NRX-101 showed no significant worsening of depression, or reversion toward pre-Study 1 baseline. By contrast, significant worsening was observed in the lurasidone alone group. The mean difference in BDM score through day 42 was 7.7 points (p=.032 between groups), which was considered a statistically large effect (d=1.60). Source: NRx Pharmaceuticals
No significant treatment-related safety issues were observed in either group, and no deaths were reported in the study. Plasma DCS levels achieved during the study were within the range expected based on prior human PK studies.
Study interpretation
Overall, these results support continued development of NRX-101 for maintenance of clinical benefit in both depression and suicidality following initial successful treatment with IV ketamine. Significant between group differences were observed on LOCF analysis for both depressive symptoms, which was the prespecified primary endpoint, and for suicidality, which was a pre-specified key secondary endpoint. For suicidality, significant LOCF differences were observed not only for formal suicidality ratings, but also for clinical impression, suggesting clinically meaningful effect.
Although the differences were not significant in the MMRM analyses, the magnitude of between-group differences suggested that a sample size of 72 subjects would be sufficient to achieve clinical significance given similar magnitude of effect. In addition, the study supported feasibility of the sequential NRX-100/ NRX-101 treatment approach and supported continued use of the combined DCS/lurasidone formulation.
Ongoing Phase IIb/III clinical trial
Our Phase IIb/III study is aimed at investigating the effects of NRx Pharmaceuticals Sequential Therapy with IV ketamine (NRX-100) following by combined DCS + lurasidone (NRX-101) vs. ketamine-lurasidone alone. This study uses a more rapid titration schedule for DCS than was used in STABIL-B, which permits proposed therapeutic dosing levels to be obtained more rapidly. Otherwise, the study methodology remains similar. The objective of the study is to replicate findings from both the Kantrowitz et al., 2015 study and STABIL-B trial showing rapid remission of symptoms on initial ketamine treatment, followed by maintained improvement throughout the 6-week NRX-101 treatment period. The primary hypotheses are that NRX-101 will be superior to lurasidone alone in maintenance of remission following initial successful ketamine treatment, as reflected both in a significant between-group separation on depression and suicidality scores as rated by the MADRS and C-SSRS scales, and in prevention of clinician-rated relapse. The study is 

33



being conducted under a SPA with the FDA, and the treatment has been granted breakthrough status. The study’s targeted enrollment of 72 subjects aged between 18-65 who will be randomized 2:1 to NRX-101 vs. lurasidone. Recruitment was halted in February 2020 due to concerns about COVID-19. Because of this pause, and our upcoming readiness of commercial drug supply, we anticipation initiating a new study with the same protocol with this new drug supply in the second half of this year.
Clinical Objectives
Our clinical objective is to offer patients the clinical benefit of rapid reduction in symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation that has been observed with intravenous ketamine, while maintaining that benefit with a daily oral agent that does not have ketamine’s potential for abuse and psychosis, and/or required supervised administration. NRX-101 is designed to offer an oral, rapid-onset and sustained home-use therapy that can significantly extend ketamine’s proven anti-suicidal and antidepressant benefits without the drawbacks of ketamine.
We believe that NRX-101 possesses potential development advantages over competing solutions. These include:

• | Initial focus on bipolar depression with ASIB and SSIB. Competitors’ pipeline products are focused on MDD and exclude bipolar patients from clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use of pharmaceutical ingredients for oral therapy for which data indicates they are devoid of adverse properties, or for which certain adverse properties may not be of concern:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of habituation and addiction. Ketamine and esketamine are DEA schedule III controlled substances and known to be potentially highly addictive. Preclinical habituation studies show no addiction potential for NRX-101 and there is no reported history of abuse of DCS in more than 60 years of human use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hallucinations and vomiting has not been reported or been a concern in our clinical studies with NRX-101. Ketamine and some of its derivatives have been associated with hallucinations and other dissociative side effects in numerous clinical studies. Ketamine and esketamine must be administered under medical supervision. For intransal esketamine (an approved intranasal ketamine derivative for psychiatric use) blood pressure spikes, nausea and vomiting are frequent adverse events. Its label requires the drug to be administered under medical supervision and monitoring of blood pressure.

Additional Potential Psychiatry Products 
Our intellectual property estate enables us to pursue additional combinations of known molecules. The majority of patients with depression have MDD. Additionally, PTSD is an area of high unmet need for which there are very few pharmacological treatment options. PTSD can also be associated with suicidality and depression, in particular severe PTSD. Whereas episodes of depression in bipolar disorder are episodic and tend to resolve in two to three months, depression is a chronic feature of MDD, and it can also be associated with PTSD. NRX-102, which we expect to pair a fixed dose combination of DCS with Mirtazapine, a currently-approved antidepressant. In the 2013 Phase II study, clinical data demonstrate the potential efficacy of DCS in combination with an SSRI antidepressant versus an SSRI antidepressant alone in treating patients with treatment-resistant MDD. We expect to continue the exploratory preclinical development of NRX-102. Further, we have identified additional 5-HT2A antagonists that may be appropriately paired with DCS. We are also further guided by preclinical data disclosed in our patents and publications which demonstrates that DCS may inhibit the akathisia induced by SSRI antidepressants.
Existing clinical data have shown DCS to be a useful initial therapeutic agent with which to target the glycine site on the NMDA receptor. However, DCS has mixed agonist/antagonist effects and its antagonist properties are only manifest

at high doses of DCS. We have identified other small molecule NMDA antagonists that are effective at lower doses and may be paired with 5-HT2A antagonists in order to yield a dual-targeted pro-drug. Accordingly, we plan to explore design initiatives to develop candidate prodrugs that will expand on the dual-targeted properties of NRX-101 and NRX-102.
NRX-201/202 will target bipolar depression and MDD/PTSD, respectively, and are anticipated to replace the DCS component of NRX-101/102 with a molecule that is more specifically targeted than DCS at the same glycine site target. Our patent portfolio includes issued and pending claims for many such dual- targeted combinations.
BriLife Vaccine for COVID-19
​
On July 11, 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with the Ministry of Defense of the State of Israel that granted NRx the right to negotiate an exclusive worldwide license to develop and market the BriLifeTM vaccine, which has been developed by Israel Institute for Biological Research (“IIBR”). However, after investigating the manufacturing requirements of the vaccine, the expected regulatory path for approval in Israel and the EU, the commercial opportunity, and the financial commitment required for development of the vaccine, the Company decided not to continue with the project. We plan to effect a transition in consultation with the IIBR. This decision was communicated to the IIBR in a letter dated March 20, 2022.
​
As part of the Company’s consideration of the vaccine project, the Company entered into a Shareholder Agreement, dated October 15, 2021 (the “Agreement”), with Shimshon Hen and David Sepiashvili, each an Israeli citizen (the “Consultants”), under which the Consultants agreed to provide certain consulting services, and which set out a framework for establishing a potential joint venture between the Consultants and the Company that would have been responsible for the development and commercialization of the BriLife vaccine. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the Consultants on October 20, 2021 under the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Company is evaluating its options with respect to the Consultants.

Summary of NRx Material In-licensing Obligations
​
NRX-100/101
Glytech Development and License Agreement (“Glytech DLA”)
We have entered into the Glytech DLA, dated May 2, 2016, which amended and restated an earlier agreement dated August 6, 2015, and which was further amended on four occasions by written agreements dated October 19, 2016, June 13, 2018, April 16, 2019 and December 31, 2020.
The License
Pursuant to the Glytech DLA, Glytech granted to NRx an irrevocable, perpetual, exclusive (even as to Glytech) royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use the Licensed Technology (as defined below) to develop, manufacture and offer for sale drug products for the treatment of depression and suicide associated with bipolar disorder in humans, including all products containing (a) DCS (including metabolites and structural variants thereof) combined with an antidepressant agent or an antipsychotic agent (including but not limited to lurasidone), or (b) DCS (including metabolites and structural variants thereof) for treatment of all types of bipolar, depressive and/or anxiety disorders and/or symptoms thereof. The key composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that supports NRx was assigned to us by Glytech in January 2021 and is no longer the subject of a license grant under the Glytech DLA; and (2) Glytech agreed to transfer and assign the remainder of the Licensed Technology and the Excluded Technology (as defined below) which are not essential for the manufacture or sale of NRX-101 to NRx for no additional consideration at any time upon receipt of written notice from us if, on or prior to August 6, 2022, (i) the value of the Glytech equity holdings in NRx (the “Glytech Equity”) has an aggregate liquidity value of at least $50 million for twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding any given date and (ii) there are no legal or contractual restrictions on selling all of the securities represented by the Glytech Equity then applicable to Glytech (or reasonably foreseeable to be applicable to Glytech within the following twenty trading days). NRx believes the criteria have been met pending the registration of Glytech shares.
Glytech also agreed to transfer and assign the Licensed Technology and the Excluded Technology to us for no additional consideration simultaneously with the closing of a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving NRx, where, as a result of such transaction, Glytech receives at the closing thereof, by virtue of its status as a stockholder of NRx, at least $50 million in cash proceeds.
As used in this section of the Glytech DLA, the term “Aggregate Liquidity Value” for any given date means the sum of each trading day’s Daily Liquidity Value during the Eligible Measurement Period applicable for such date, and “Daily Liquidity Value” for any particular trading date means the aggregate proceeds Glytech would receive if it sold that number of shares of Glytech Equity on such trading date equal to 5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock or successor stock sold on such trading date. “Licensed Technology” means the patent rights and know how that disclose, describe or claim subject matter relating to use of DCS in combination with one or more antidepressants or one or more atypical antipsychotics (e.g., lurasidone) that are controlled by Glytech or its affiliates. “Excluded Technology” means any other patent right and knowhow owned by Glytech that does not relate specifically to compositions containing either DCS or lurasidone.
NRx Obligations
The Glytech DLA imposes certain obligations on NRx in connection with maintaining the Glytech License, which include:

• | NRx is required to pay to Glytech a fixed annual support payment in the amount of $250,000 per year and to reimburse reasonable, documented travel expenses not exceeding $50,000 per year to support travel to meetings related to patent prosecutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NRx has assumed responsibility for the payment of ongoing patent prosecution costs and related costs required to perfect the Licensed Technology and related intellectual property rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

36




• | Prior to the assignment of the Licensed Technology and Excluded Technology by Glytech to NRx (such date, the “Assignment Date”), NRx is required to pay or reimburse Glytech for the full costs of defending any patent rights included in the Licensed Technology and Excluded Technology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to the Assignment Date, NRx has an obligation to institute, prosecute and control any action or proceeding with respect to any suspected or actual infringement or misappropriation by a third party of any Licensed Technology and Excluded Technology at its own expense. After the Assignment Date, NRx will be the owner of the Licensed Technology and the Excluded Technology, and as such will have full discretion in the institution and prosecution of any infringement action involving the Licensed Technology and the Excluded Technology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NRx has agreed to indemnify Glytech and certain related parties from and against any liability or expense (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from suits or claims by any third party arising out of (i) NRx’s, or its permitted sublicensee’s, sale or experimental use of products developed from any advice or assistance provided by Glytech hereunder; or (ii) the death of or injury to any person or any damage to property, arising from the development, manufacture, marketing, sale or use of any product developed from the Licensed Technology. NRx’s obligation to indemnify Glytech does not apply to any losses arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Glytech or its related parties or any breach by Glytech of the Glytech DLA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glytech Termination Rights
The term of the Glytech DLA continues for an indefinite period unless terminated by one or both parties in accordance with its terms. Glytech has an independent right to terminate the Glytech DLA in the event that (a) NRx is in material breach of the Glytech DLA, including material breaches of the obligations set forth above, and does not rectify such breach within thirty (30) days of notification (unless such breach is not capable of rectification within such thirty (30) day period and NRx acts diligently in a commercially reasonable manner to correct such breach) or (b) if NRx becomes insolvent or has proceedings in voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy instituted against it.
If Glytech terminates the Glytech DLA, then the Glytech License is withdrawn and NRx is required to transfer and assign all of its assets to Glytech, including without limitation any inventions, patent rights and knowhow developed by NRx from the Licensed Technology and all data and research, in whatever format, relating to the Licensed Technologies and the products.
NRx is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Glytech DLA.

State University of New York License and Option Agreement
We have entered into a written License and Option Agreement as described below with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (the “Foundation”), dated September 1, 2020 (the “SUNY License Agreement”).
The License
Pursuant to the SUNY License Agreement, the Foundation has granted to us a revocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license, without the right to sublicense, with royalties paid for two (2) years, to use Foundation Subject Matter (as defined below) to develop, manufacture and offer for sale products and/or services for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 in humans and/or COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. Although the license is non-exclusive, the Foundation has agreed in writing that it will not grant any other licenses to Foundation Subject Matter that would allow any third-party to manufacture or offer for sale products or services for the treatment of COVID-19 during the term of the SUNY License Agreement.
“Foundation Subject Matter” means the technical information and material that are owned by Foundation, and all other intellectual property, including scientific and clinical information and data, protocols, trademarks, and trade secrets associated with or relating to (a) the therapeutic uses of the Foundation Subject Matter to treat COVID-19 in humans and/or COVID-19 associated respiratory failure (the “Primary Field Use”) and (b) the therapeutic or prophylactic uses of the Foundation Subject Matter to treat other human pulmonary disorders, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) and sepsis (the “Alternative Field Use”). Such technical information and materials include know-how, formulations, knowledge, compositions, methods, processes, and procedures pertaining to the isolation, preparation, formulation, and/or administration of VIP for the treatment of a human disorder, which includes the IND application entitled “Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) in the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome”, Hussein Foda, MD, Investigator; State University of New York at Stony Brook, Sponsor.
The term of the SUNY License Agreement is two (2) years from the date of the agreement (the “Term”) during which period, the parties are expected to negotiate a superseding royalty-bearing license for the Primary Field Use. The royalty rate and other terms and conditions contained in any such superseding license will be negotiated by the parties taking into 

39



account the prevailing circumstances and consistent with industry standards. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the terms and conditions of the superseding license, the current license will terminate at the end of the Term unless otherwise agreed.
The Option
The SUNY License Agreement also grants an exclusive option to NRx to negotiate for a commercial royalty-bearing, worldwide license with the right to sublicense, to manufacture and offer for sale products and/or services that encompass the Foundation Subject Matter for the Alternative Field Use. During the Term, the Foundation has agreed to refrain from offering any commercial rights whatsoever in Foundation Subject Matter for the Alternative Field Use to any third party. However, if NRx exercises its option and the parties are unable to agree to terms and conditions for a royalty bearing commercial license within 60 days, the option will automatically terminate and NRx will have no rights to Foundation Subject Matter in the Alternative Field Use.
NRx Obligations
The SUNY License Agreement imposes certain obligations on NRx in order to maintain the license, including the following:

• | A fixed maintenance fee in the amount of USD$50,000 due to the Foundation on September 1, 2021 has been paid.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are required to diligently pursue the development and commercialization of the Foundation Subject Matter through the implementation of an agreed Development & Commercialization Plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We must indemnify and hold harmless the Foundation and certain of its affiliates against any liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any claims or actions arising out of (i) the development manufacture, marketing sale or use (in commerce or human clinical trials) by NRx or its affiliates of any product, process or service relating to, or developed pursuant to, the SUNY License Agreement; or (ii) any other activities carried out by or on behalf of NRx pursuant to the SUNY License Agreement. Such indemnity does not apply if the liability, damage or loss is attributable to the negligent activities of the Foundation or its affiliates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are required, at our sole cost and expense, to procure and maintain policies of comprehensive general liability insurance in amounts not less than USD$5 million with the Foundation named as an additional insured under such policies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are required to maintain full and accurate books and records, which the Foundation has the right to inspect, and to provide semi-annual reports, including the status of our progress with the agreed plan for development and commercialization of the Foundation Subject Matter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are required to comply with all applicable laws, including export controls regulations. We are currently in compliance with our obligations under the SUNY License Agreement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUNY Termination Rights
The Foundation has the right to deliver a default notice if we commit a material breach of the SUNY Licensee Agreement. If NRx is unable to cure such default within thirty (30) days following notice and provide adequate assurance of future performance, then the Foundation may terminate the SUNY License Agreement. The SUNY License Agreement terminates automatically if NRx: (i) ceases to attempt to carry on its business with respect to the rights granted in such agreement; (ii) becomes insolvent; (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) challenges the validity or enforceability of such agreement before any court, arbitrator, or other tribunal. Upon termination of the SUNY License Agreement for any reason, we must cease all use of Foundation Subject Matter.
As of the date hereof, we have not received any notice from the Foundation alleging any material breach of the SUNY License Agreement by NRx.

40



U.S. Government Rights
The license granted by the Foundation is subject to the rights of the U.S. Government, if any, resulting from any funding of the Foundation Subject Matter by the U.S. Government. This may include (i) reserving to the U.S. Government, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Foundation Subject Matter and (ii) requiring that any products produced using the Foundation Subject Matter that are used or sold by us in the U.S. must be manufactured substantially in the U.S. unless a waiver under 35 U.S.C. Section 204 is granted by the appropriate U.S. government agency.
Binding Collaboration Agreement with Relief Therapeutics
We entered into a Binding Collaboration Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2020 (the “Collaboration Agreement”), with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG and its wholly owned subsidiary Therametrics Discovery AG (“Relief Therapeutics”).
The Collaboration
The Collaboration Agreement established the terms under which NRx and Relief Therapeutics were expected to collaborate and assist each other to maximize revenues in their respective territories from the Relief Product. The NRx territory included the U.S., Canada, and Israel. The Relief Therapeutics territory included the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and Vatican City. The collaboration was expected to be conducted on an exclusive basis with the parties agreeing not to develop or commercialize any drug product that may be competitive with the Relief Product.
The Collaboration Agreement provided that Relief Therapeutics fund the costs associated with the intravenous clinical trials and development of the inhaled Relief Product in the U.S., which was expected to be conducted and managed by NRx. We were responsible for ensuring that the cost of the clinical trials and development activities did not exceed the budget contemplated accepted by the parties by more than 30% without required approvals.
The Collaboration Agreement also provided options for the parties to develop the Relief Product to treat lung conditions that are not COVID-19 related and for the commercialization of the Relief Product outside the parties’ respective territories.
The other assets that the parties were expected to bring to the collaboration include:
Relief Therapeutics:

• | Sole funding for clinical trials, formulation and stability of the Relief Product, and purchasing supplies for drug manufacturing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. Patent No. 8,178,489, and related patents and corresponding foreign patents;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. and European Union Orphan Drug Designations related to ARDS, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary hypertension;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EU-compliant toxicity file and preclinical data; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical Phase II data from prior in-human trials conducted in the EU.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

​

41



NRx:

• | U.S. regulatory information;
--+-----------------------------


• | Authorized application, and information included in, or pursuant to, U.S. IND 149,152 or U.S. IND 151,070 and related documents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) clinical trial structure with multiple qualified study sites, data monitoring, institutional review board, active protocols, and ongoing data collection;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing and cGMP formulation and stability data for the Relief Product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Qualification through SAMS and teaming agreements with BARDA preferred partners.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For U.S. regulatory purposes, NRx was expected to be the sole applicant on any NDA or other application for a regulatory license submitted to the FDA with respect to the Relief Product. However, the parties were expected to jointly control all material decisions related to any NDA and any related matters.
Funding by Relief Therapeutics
The Collaboration Agreement provided that Relief Therapeutics fund the costs associated with the intravenous clinical trials and development of the inhaled Relief Product in the U.S., which was expected to be conducted and managed by NRx. We were appointed to direct, design, and implement the entire pathway for U.S. drug approval for the Relief Product. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, NRx was responsible for not exceeding the Relief Product trial budget of $8.3 million by more than 30% (approximately $10.7 million) for the original sample size of 144 participants (the “Initial Budget”). In October 2020, the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board and statistical consultant advised us to increase the size of the study to at least 200 participants, resulting in an additional $4 million in potential study costs. The Collaboration Agreement stated that costs of drug formulation, manufacture, CMC, stability, etc., are not included within the Initial Budget, however, Relief Therapeutics was required to fund the costs of formulation, stability, and manufacturing at MedisourceRx, Bachem, and Nephron Pharmaceuticals.
The Collaboration Agreement stated that in the event Relief Therapeutics did not approve additional overages to the Initial Budget, NRx would be free to bring in other parties in order to complete the Relief Product study. The Collaboration Agreement further provided for Relief Therapeutics to fund the costs associated with the clinical development of the inhaled Relief Product in the U.S. in reliance upon our agreement to conduct, manage, supervise and oversee its clinical development. Should Relief Therapeutics not fund the costs associated with the clinical development of the inhaled Relief Product in the U.S., then we would have the freedom to bring a replacement investor.
Relief Therapeutics reimbursed us for approximately $10.9 million of expenses but has not paid approximately $10 million in invoiced costs associated with conducting of the Relief Product clinical trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI. Additionally, Relief Therapeutics has declined to approve the budget. We have advised Relief Therapeutics that we are funding those costs with capital provided by other investors. This lack of funding on the part of Relief Therapeutics, therefore, does not negatively impact our ability to continue development of ZYESAMI.
Sharing of Intellectual Property
Under the Collaboration Agreement, each party had a broad right to use the other party’s intellectual property to develop and commercialize the Relief Product in its respective territory. To the extent necessary, each party was required to grant, or obtain from third parties, cross-licenses to allow the other party to use its intellectual property in the other party’s territory.
Each party was expected to continue to own the intellectual property it possessed prior to the collaboration, and any intellectual property that was developed jointly by the parties relating to the Relief Product would be owned jointly by the parties and each party would have the right to use any joint intellectual property in its territory. Each party was responsible for filing and prosecuting applications for patents, trademarks and other intellectual property in their respective territories and for the protection, maintenance, and enforcement of such intellectual property in such territory.

42



Commercialization
Under the Collaboration Agreement, each party was to develop a commercialization plan for the Relief Product in its territory, which was subject to approval by the other party, and each party was obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Relief Product in its territory consistent with the approved commercialization plan. Each party had full rights to commercialize the Relief Product in its territory, subject to the approved commercialization plan, including the right to work with licensees, distributors, research organizations, marketing organizations and other third parties. Each party agreed not to commercialize the Relief Product in the other party’s territory. Relief Therapeutics retained the right to identify commercialization partners for countries outside the parties’ territories, and any arrangements with such commercialization partners would have been subject to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.
Division of Profits
Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the parties would have shared the net profits from the sale of the Relief Product as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------------+---+-----------------+---+--------------+----+--
​ | ​ | NRx | ​ | ​ | ​ 
​ | ​ | Pharmaceuticals | ​ | ​ | ​ 
​ | ​ | Share | ​ | Relief Share
NRx Territory | ​ | 50 | % | ​ | 50 | %
Relief Therapeutics Territory | ​ | 15 | % | ​ | 85 | %
Rest of the World | | 20 | % | ​ | 80 | %

​
Each party was required to maintain books and records sufficient to confirm the net profits generated from the sales of Relief Product in their respective territories and each party had the right to audit the other party’s books and records. The net profits was to be calculated after reimbursement to Relief Therapeutics for the cost of any supplies funded by Relief Therapeutics in connection with the manufacturing of the Relief Product.
Our share of the profits from our territory could have been at risk if we did not achieve at least 70% of the sales targets agreed from time to time by the parties (absent macroscopic changes in the market environment), in which case, Relief Therapeutics would have had the right to engage an outside sales entity to manage U.S. sales.
As described elsewhere, Relief Therapeutics has filed the Complaint claiming that we failed to honor our obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. The Complaint seeks several remedies for Relief Therapeutics, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. We believe that the claims are baseless and without merit. Subsequently, the Company filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming Relief Therapeutics breached and repudiated the Collaboration Agreement. The Company’s complaint seeks damages of at least $185 million. However, the parties to the lawsuits agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation, held a mediation meeting on February 22, 2022, and plan to hold an additional mediation meeting in the coming months. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully resolve the dispute through mediation or that, in the event the dispute continues in litigation, we will be successful in our claims or our opposition to Relief Therapeutics’ claims.

Manufacturing and Distribution Agreements
We have partnered in the U.S. with Nephron Pharmaceuticals and Alcami as contract manufacturers, and with the Polypeptide Group as a supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”). In Israel, we have partnered with Nextar, LTD. All are qualified cGMP manufacturers, inspected by the FDA and, in the case of Nextar, by EMEA and the Israel Ministry of Health as well. We have also signed a contract with Cardinal Health to distribute our product nationwide.
Cardinal Health Distribution Agreement
We have entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Cardinal Health 105, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”), with an effective date of September 25, 2020 (the “CHDA”). Under the CHDA, we appointed Cardinal Health as the exclusive third-party logistics distribution agent, and as an authorized distributor, of certain NRx’s products (the “Products”) in the U.S. and its territories, possessions and commonwealths.
The Services
Under the CHDA, Cardinal Health will provide services to us including, without limitation, storage, distribution, returns, customer support, financial support, EDI and system access support (the “CHDA Services”). The CHDA Services are to be provided by Cardinal Health as set forth in one of two operating model guidelines: the Traditional Third-Party Logistics (“3PL”) Operating Guidelines (“OPG”), or the Title Model Operating Guidelines (“TMOPG”). Both the OPG and the TMOPG are attached to and incorporated by reference into the CHDA. NRx and Cardinal Health have not yet decided which of these two operating model guidelines will govern the delivery of the CHDA Services; that decision will be made closer to approval by the FDA of our first commercial product.
The OPG:

• | Identify written policies and procedures to be followed in delivering the CHDA Services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify the deliverables from each Party required under the CHDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Define the roles and responsibilities of each Party and key personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Define the reports and data required; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | Set the baseline for the OPG program for delivery of the CHDA Services, and manage future changes to the operating model.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the OPG, Cardinal Health will accept the Products from us on consignment, with the Products being transported by us or its shipping agent to Cardinal Health’s secured access 3PL warehousing facilities. Cardinal Health has established standard operating procedures for managing all activities at its warehousing facilities, which are approved and controlled by Cardinal Health’s centralized distribution management system. All Cardinal Health warehouse personnel are trained under documented
46



programs that are compliant with applicable federal and state laws and regulations and with cGMP. Our Products are warehoused by Cardinal Health under controlled temperature conditions, with any temperature excursions lasting more than one hour being reported within two business days from the discovery of the excursion. The Products are picked from inventory in Cardinal Health’s warehouse on a “First-to-Expire, First-Out” basis.
Pricing and conditions of sale are set by us. Cardinal Health publishes price lists for the Products to be sold to its customers. Cardinal Health sends invoices via email to customers on the day of shipment, or by mail on the morning following shipment, of the Products. Customers then remit payment to our bank lockbox via EFT, ACH or wire transfer, and NRx’s bank then forwards information regarding payments to Cardinal Health which then reconciles and applies cash receipts to the accounts receivable.
Most of the logistical provisions in the TMOPG are identical to those of the OPG. The primary material difference between the TMOPG and the OPG is that under the TMOPG, title to and ownership of the Products pass from NRx to Cardinal Health upon purchase of the Products by Cardinal Health from NRx or its manufacturing agent. Cardinal Health handles all sales, shipment/distribution, customer service and AR activities in the same way as outlined for the OPG model, except that Cardinal Health maintains a bank lockbox for receipt of payments of invoices by customers, rather than that lockbox being maintained by NRx.
Pricing and Payment; Forecast and Price List
As compensation for the CHDA Services delivered by Cardinal Health, we are responsible for paying the fees set forth in the CHDA. The fees schedule is confidential to Cardinal Health and cannot be disclosed without permission from Cardinal Health. Fees are subject to adjustment not more than once per contract year (after the first contract year) by 3%, or if Cardinal Health can reasonably demonstrate a material increase in the cost of providing the CHDA Services.
Under the CHDA, we are responsible for providing a forecast of volume of the Products to be handled by Cardinal Health. Any variances from the forecast, and any adjustments that may therefore be needed to the forecast going forward, are handled through good-faith negotiation by the parties. We are also responsible for providing to Cardinal Health a Product price list, setting prices to be charged to customers for the Products sold by or distributed by Cardinal Health. Any change to be implemented in pricing for the Products must be communicated by us to Cardinal Health at least 72 hours prior to the effective date of such price change.
Term and Termination
The CHDA has an initial term of three (3) years following first shipment of an FDA-approved Product to a commercial customer (the “Initial Term”), and automatically renews for additional terms of one (1) year (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless the CHDA is earlier terminated during either the Initial Term or any Renewal Term by a written notice of termination given by either party to the other at least 90 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. The CHDA also can be immediately terminated by either party if: (1) the other party files for bankruptcy protection or enters into receivership or trusteeship, and if a bankruptcy or insolvency order is entered such order is not discharged within 30 days; or (2) the other party materially breaches any provision of the CHDA and such breach is not cured within 30 days of receiving notice of breach from the non-breaching party, except that Cardinal Health may terminate the CHDA if NRx fails to timely pay invoices from Cardinal Health within 15 days of having received written notice of non-payment from Cardinal Health. Following termination for any reason, each party’s rights and obligations that accrued prior to the date of termination shall survive the termination, and all Products warehoused at Cardinal Health’s 3PL facilities will be returned to NRx or its designee.
Polypeptide GMP Manufacturing Agreement
The Company entered into a GMP Manufacturing contract with Polypeptide Laboratories, Inc. (“Polypeptide”) to supply GMP-grade aviptadil acetate (the drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient used to manufacture ZYESAMI). As of the date of this annual report, 4 kilograms of aviptadil has been released to the Company and an additional 3 kilograms is expected to be released to the Company in Q2 2022. The agreement includes a stability study and 

47



analytical testing. The Polypeptide Group’s material has not yet been qualified by the FDA for human use and this qualification is anticipated as part of our NDA for ZYESAMI.
Nephron Master Services Agreement
We have entered into a Master Services Agreement with Nephron SC, Inc., and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a subsidiary of Nephron, Inc. (collectively, the “Nephron”) with an effective date of August 25, 2020 (the “Nephron Agreement”). The Nephron Agreement was subsequently amended on September 2, 2020, November 5, 2020 and February 8, 2021.
Under the Nephron Agreement, Nephron is NRx’s primary U.S. based supplier of ZYESAMI in forms suitable for both injection and inhalation. We will be responsible for sourcing and providing Nephron with the active pharmaceutical ingredient for ZYESAMI, other raw materials and the labeling information necessary for Nephron to manufacture and supply ZYESAMI to us. Nephron is responsible for providing excipients (inactive ingredients), components, packaging and other materials necessary to manufacture and deliver ZYESAMI in accordance with the purchase orders placed by us.
Nephron will be required to manufacture ZYESAMI in accordance with cGMP, NRx’s specifications and the requirements of the Nephron Agreement, which includes stringent quality assessments, inspection, testing, storage and record keeping provisions. The quality systems, processes and technical controls related to the quality assurance requirements for the manufacture and supply of ZYESAMI have been further detailed in a separate quality agreement between the parties. We have the right to inspect and audit Nephron’s facilities from time to time.
The Nephron Agreement has an initial term of five (5) years from the date of the first commercial shipment to NRx, which may be extended by successive annual one (1) year renewals. Either party may terminate the Nephron Agreement prior to the expiration of the term in the event of a material breach by, or bankruptcy of, the other party, subject to applicable cure periods. In addition, we have the right to terminate by giving notice to Nephron if certain events occur, including the issuance by the FDA of a “Warning Letter” to Nephron with respect to any facility used to manufacture, test, validate, label, package or store ZYESAMI or the receipt by us of an excessive number of documented customer complaints related to ZYESAMI quality.
During the term and for one (1) year thereafter, Nephron may not develop, manufacture, supply, distribute or market ZYESAMI or its bioequivalent for or on behalf of itself or any third party, unless it acquires certain rights from NRx.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the U.S. and in other countries, at the Federal, state and local level, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export, pricing, and government contracting related to pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate Federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions or other actions, such as the FDA’s delay in review of or refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or study termination, issuance of Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, mandated modifications to promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, requests for product recalls, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow product import or export, total or partial suspension of or restriction of or imposition of other requirements relating to production or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment from government
48



contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by local or central IRBs who are charged with protecting safety of research subjects before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of human studies that meet the legal standard of “adequate and well-controlled clinical trials”, in accordance with cGCP and other regulations in order to establish the safety and efficacy
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the proposed drug product for each indication;

• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical trial sites to determine GCP compliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with GMP regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Additionally, if a drug is considered a controlled substance, prior to the commencement of marketing, the DEA must also determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. During this time, among other things, the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. The FDA may raise concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and place the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Implications for NRX-100/101
We have filed INDs and the FDA has accepted INDs 134025 and 129194 for NRX-100 and NRX-101 respectively. The FDA has advised us that no further preclinical studies are needed for submission of an NDA for NRX-100. The FDA has advised us and we have agreed that a genotoxicity study and a non-clinical maternal/fetal study for potential fetal effects are required prior to filing of an NDA for NRX-101. The FDA guidance exempts drugs used for less than 12 weeks for carcinogenicity studies. We intend to seek the FDA’s written exemption from carcinogenicity studies on the grounds that treatment with NRX-101 is expected to last less than 12 weeks.

Implications for ZYESAMI
It is well known that the FDA is uniquely rigorous in its safety requirements for pulmonary drugs because of the extraordinary vulnerability of the cells that line the lung to potential injury. An extensive body of nonclinical studies was amassed by Mondo Biotech, the predecessor of Relief Therapeutics (“Mondo”), and Biogen, Inc. (“Biogen”) between 2005 and 2011, which resulted in the filing of an IMPD with European regulatory authorities. Mondo conducted four regulatory meetings with the FDA and agreed on an extensive package of both acute and chronic toxicity, clinical pharmacology, and pharmacokinetic studies that would be required prior to human studies of aviptadil in the U.S. Although Biogen never entered the U.S. market because of its decision to focus on other therapeutic areas, all requested studies were completed to the FDA’s specifications by GLP-compliant contract research organizations. We have obtained the FDA’s written communication that all required nonclinical safety studies related to ZYESAMI (aviptadil) have been submitted to the FDA and reviewed. The FDA has advised us that no further nonclinical studies are required or anticipated prior to filing of the NDA for ZYESAMI.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and review and approval by an IRB. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, a central or local IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial, including any changes, while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In Phase II, the drug typically is administered through well-controlled studies to a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase III, the drug is administered to an expanded subject population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the U.S. is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FFDCA.
Progress reports and other summary information detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if certain Serious Adverse Events occur or other significant safety information is found. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or the protocol. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding 

50



the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Implications for NRX-100/101
In the case of NRX-100/101, the FDA has agreed with us in writing that the investigational product meets the standards for a 505.b.2 (commonly called drug-repurposing) pathway, whereby the extensive safety literature regarding the individual components of NRX-101 may be cited in lieu of repeating various preclinical and Phase I clinical studies.
Because of examples in recent years where sponsors have received Complete Response Letters based on lack of agreement with the FDA regarding the research path required for NDA submission, we worked collaboratively with the FDA for one year in order to negotiate a Special Protocol Agreement (“SPA”) that would govern the development of NRX-101 and would define the Phase III trial required for drug approval, should the clinical trial be successful. This SPA was issued to us in April 2018 and defines the single clinical trial required for approval of NRX-101 for treatment of bipolar depression with acute suicidal ideation or behavior.
Implications for ZYESAMI
In the case of ZYESAMI, the path to drug approval is based on 505.b.1. Moreover, the FDA awarded Orphan Drug Status to the State University of New York at Stony Brook for the use of VIP, a prior formulation of ZYESAMI, in ARDS in 2001. However, COVID-19 is not considered a rare disease and the FDA has advised us that any potential benefits afforded to aviptadil based on an orphan drug designation would not apply to its use for the treatment of COVID-19. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We do not anticipate obtaining orphan drug protection for the treatment of COVID-19.”
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. A waiver from the application user fee may be sought by an applicant. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first human drug application. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. The FDA aims to review 90% of all standard review applications within ten months of acceptance for filing and six months of acceptance for filing for priority review applications.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA may also require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) program either during the application process or after the approval of the drug to ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk tracking and minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional 

51



information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
Under the FFDCA, before approving a drug for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that drug to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the drug to an advisory committee. The external advisory committee review may also be required for other drugs because of certain other issues, including clinical trial design, safety and effectiveness, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications by the manufacturer and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations.
The testing and approval process for a NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has a review goal of completing its review of 90% of resubmissions within two or six months after receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post- marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, certain circumstances may require FDA notification, review, or approval, as well as further testing. These may include some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, or new safety information.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and Breakthrough Therapy (as defined below) designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions, and 

52



demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if the product will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy, safety, or public health factors. If Fast Track designation is obtained, drug sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information.
In some cases, a Fast Track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application in six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for Fast Track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses or conditions and that fill an unmet medical need may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “Breakthrough Therapy.” A Breakthrough Therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as Breakthrough Therapies are eligible for the Fast Track designation features as described above, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Implications for NRX-101
Subsequent to the issuance of the SPA, in November 2018, the FDA also issued a Breakthrough Therapy designation to NRX-101. Breakthrough Therapy designation is awarded to drugs that have demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy for the treatment of a serious medical condition for which there is an unmet medical need.

53



Implications for ZYESAMI
The FDA has additionally awarded Fast Track designation to NRx for development of ZYESAMI in the treatment of critical COVID-19 under IND 149152. Fast Track designation is awarded to drugs that have demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy for the treatment of a serious medical condition for which there is an unmet medical need. It is important to note that the landscape for COVID-19 treatments of patients in later stages of the disease has been particularly difficult, standards of care have changed rapidly, and may continue to evolve rapidly. Such rapid changes can affect the stance of the FDA when evaluating a drug.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and list drugs manufactured at their facilities with the FDA. These facilities are further subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior approval by the FDA or notification to the FDA before or after being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product becomes available in the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, holds or termination of post-approval clinical trials or FDA debarment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay or refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory authority, including the FDA, issued safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modifications to promotional material or issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

54




• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment, disgorgement and restitution, as well as consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians in the practice of medicine may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing or promoting their drug products for uses outside of the approved indications in the approved prescribing information. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FFDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, and mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), which, among other things, regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Quality and Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding drug products. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufactures will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products such that they would result in serious adverse health consequences or death, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Regulation under the Drug Enforcement Administration
We are required to evaluate the abuse potential of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates are considered controlled substances, we will need to comply with additional regulatory requirements. NRX-100 (ketamine) is a controlled substance with high abuse potential. Both of the components of NRX-101 are approved drugs (DCS and lurasidone) and neither is a controlled substance. We have completed abuse liability studies for DCS and identified no abuse potential. ZYESAMI is not a CNS- active drug so evaluation of abuse potential is not relevant.
Certain drug products may be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the DEA’s implementing regulations. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the U.S. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The FDA provides a recommendation to the DEA as to whether a drug should be classified as a controlled substance and the appropriate level of control. If DEA scheduling is required, a drug product may not be marketed until the scheduling process is completed, which could delay the launch of the product.
Depending on the Schedule, drug products may be subject to registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA, which are directly applicable to product applicants, contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control 

55



extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports may be required to made to the DEA for the distribution of certain controlled substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or significant losses of any controlled substance. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings or consent decrees. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances.
Federal and State Healthcare related, Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse, and other laws regulations, and requirements restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, state and federal transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care professionals, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations and other requirements applicable to the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical manufacturers. There are also laws, regulations, and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal contracts and grants.
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain provisions of the criminal health care fraud statute (discussed below) such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim for payment for items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties and damages, exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs and corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. Conviction or civil judgments are also grounds for debarment from government contracts.
The Federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the U.S. Government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record 

56



or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, including payments under a federal grant. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. Government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been sued under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill Federal programs for the product. Companies have also been sued for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. In addition, Federal health care programs require drug manufacturers to report drug pricing information, which is used to quantify discounts and establish reimbursement rates. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been sued for reporting allegedly false pricing information, which caused the manufacturer to understate rebates owed or, when used to determine reimbursement rates, caused overpayment to providers. Violations of the civil False Claims Act may result in civil penalties and damages as well as exclusion from Federal healthcare programs and corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. The U.S. Government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the U.S. Government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. Violations of the criminal False Claims Act can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. Conviction or civil judgments and other conduct are also grounds for debarment from U.S. Government contracts and grants.
HIPAA also created Federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As discussed above, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain of HIPAA’s healthcare fraud provisions such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of HIPAA’s fraud and abuse provisions may result in fines or imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs, depending on the conduct in question. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a Federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The Veterans Health Care Act requires manufacturers of covered drugs to offer them for sale on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable Federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil and criminal sanctions.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased Federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Affordable Care Act created new Federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. Government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; and/or require drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the U.S. Government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Penalties for violating HIPAA include civil penalties, criminal penalties and imprisonment. Among other things, HITECH, through its 

57



implementing regulations, makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in Federal courts to enforce the Federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing Federal civil actions.
In addition, other Federal and state laws govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the U.S., the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the U.S., Federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.
In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
The Medicare Modernization Act imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription, pharmacy drugs pursuant to federal regulations. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each 

58



therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the U.S. Government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the NIH, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Affordable Care Act, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expansion of Medicaid benefits and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and expansion of the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the U.S., can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,
59



commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. We may seek Paragraph IV Certification for our product candidates. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FFDCA provides a five-year period of non- patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity.
A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non- infringement.
The FFDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-

year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well- controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity period described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the U.S. will be recovered from U.S. sales.
Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan drug designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-We do not anticipate orphan drug protection for the treatment of COVID-19.”
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union Drug Approval Process

61



To obtain marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit MAAs either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
National authorization procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the data on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the European Union until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
