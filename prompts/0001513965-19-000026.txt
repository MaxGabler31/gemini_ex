Item 1. Business
Overview
American Midstream Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed in August 2009 to own, operate, develop and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets. We provide critical midstream infrastructure that links producers of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs and condensate to numerous intermediate and end-use markets. We engage in the business of gathering, treating, processing and transporting natural gas; gathering, transporting, treating and fractionating NGLs; and gathering, storing and transporting crude oil and condensates.
Our primary assets are strategically located in some of the most prolific onshore and offshore producing regions and key demand markets in the United States. Our liquids and natural gas gathering and natural gas processing assets are primarily located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the Cotton Valley/Haynesville Shale of East Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, the Bakken Shale of North Dakota and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Our liquid pipelines and natural gas transportation assets are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Texas and Tennessee and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we operate a fleet of NGL gathering and transportation trucks in the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin. 
A significant portion of our cash flow is derived from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which includes:

• | a 66.7% operated interest in Destin Pipeline Company, L.L.C. ("Destin"), a natural gas pipeline;


• | a 66.7% operated interest in Okeanos Gas Gathering Company, LLC ("Okeanos"), a natural gas gathering system;


• | a 50.0% non-operated interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC ("Cayenne"), a NGL pipeline;

During 2018, in order to improve operational alignment, we reorganized our reporting structure such that the operations of the following assets have been transferred between segments as follows:

• | our Cushing, Oklahoma assets have been moved from our Terminalling Services segment to our Liquid Pipelines and Services segment as a result of the dispositions of our refined products terminals (“Refined Products”) and our marine liquids terminals (“Marine Products”);


• | our AMID NGL Trucking asset (formerly part of Crude Oil Supply and Logistics ("COSL")) has been moved from our Liquid Pipelines and Services segment to our Gas Gathering and Processing Services segment;


• | our Cayenne asset has been moved from our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment to our Liquid Pipelines and Services segment; and


• | our Chalmette System assets have been moved from our Natural Gas Transportation Services segment to our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment.

These reporting changes do not impact our previously reported consolidated financial results, but our prior period segment results have been recast to reflect the changes.
During 2018, we entered into, and completed, the following definitive agreements for the sale of certain of our assets:

• | On June 18, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of Marine Products to institutional investors for approximately $210 million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments. On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of Marine Products. Net proceeds from this disposition were $208.6 million, exclusive of $5.7 million in advisory fees and other costs, and were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. 


• | On November 15, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of Refined Products to Sunoco LLC for approximately $125 million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments. On December 20, 2018, we completed the sale of Refined Products. Net proceeds from this disposition were $125 million, exclusive of $3.7 million in advisory fees and other costs, and were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. 

Subsequent to the dispositions of Refined Products and Marine Products, we eliminated the Terminalling Services segment and we currently operate our business through the remaining four reportable segments. Additionally, as a result of the disposition of the Propane Marketing Services business ("Propane Business") in 2017, we eliminated the Propane Marketing Services segment, which is included in Discontinued Operations. For more information on our dispositions, see Part II. Item 8. Note 5. Dispositions of this 2018 Form 10-K.
Pending Merger 
On September 27, 2018, the Board received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from Magnolia Infrastructure Holdings, LLC (“Magnolia”), an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“ArcLight”), pursuant to which Magnolia or one of its affiliates would acquire all common units of the Partnership that Magnolia and its affiliates do not already own in exchange for $6.10 per common unit. The Board delegated authority to review and approve the proposal to the independent Conflicts Committee of the Board.
On January 2, 2019, the Board received a revised unsolicited non-binding proposal from Magnolia, pursuant to which Magnolia, or one of its affiliates, would acquire all common units of the Partnership that Magnolia and its affiliates do not already own in exchange for $4.50 per common unit. The other proposed terms of the potential transaction remained as set forth in the original non-binding proposal received on September 27, 2018. Consistent with its prior delegation of authority, the Board referred the revised offer to the Conflicts Committee of the Board.
On March 17, 2019, as recommended by the Conflicts Committee of the Board and after receiving the opinion of the financial advisor of the Conflicts Committee, Evercore, the Partnership and our General Partner entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Anchor Midstream Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Proposed Parent”), Anchor Midstream Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Proposed Merger Sub”), and High Point Infrastructure Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HPIP”), pursuant to which Proposed Merger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of our General Partner and Proposed Parent (the “Pending Merger”).
If the Pending Merger is completed, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding common unit of the Partnership, other than those held by Proposed Parent and its affiliates, will be converted into the right to receive $5.25 per common unit in cash without any interest thereon (the “Merger Consideration”). The Incentive Distribution Rights (as defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (as amended, the “Partnership Agreement”)) in the Partnership issued and 
4

outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Pending Merger shall, as a result of the merger, automatically be canceled and cease to exist, with no consideration delivered in respect thereof. The common units held by Proposed Parent and its affiliates and the General Partner Interest (as defined in our Partnership Agreement) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Pending Merger shall be unaffected by the Pending Merger and shall remain outstanding. 
The Pending Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019, pending the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we will no longer have publicly listed or registered common units, although we may still be required to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes.
If the Pending Merger is consummated, it will be a taxable event to our unaffiliated unitholders with recognition of gain or loss in the same manner as if they had sold their units in us for the amount specified in the Merger Agreement.
Under the Partnership Agreement, the Pending Merger is required to be approved by a majority of the outstanding common units and preferred units, voting as a class, and each class of preferred units. Affiliates of ArcLight own approximately 51% of such voting power and prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, affiliates of ArcLight delivered to the Partnership a written consent approving the Pending Merger. As such, the Pending Merger has been approved by the limited partners of the Partnership, and the Partnership will not hold a meeting of its unitholders to approve the merger. Accordingly, as permitted by the Delaware Revised Uniform Partnership Act and our Partnership Agreement, by resolutions adopted by written consent dated March 17, 2019, affiliates of ArcLight holding a majority of the outstanding units on such date approved the Pending Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The closing of the Pending Merger is subject to conditions described more completely in the Merger Agreement, including (i) certain regulatory approvals, (ii) effecting modifications to our Credit Agreement, including entrance into the Waiver (as defined below), and (iii) other customary closing conditions. The Merger Agreement includes customary representations and warranties. It also includes customary covenants and agreements, including interim operating covenants and non-solicitation provisions and includes customary termination provisions, including if the Pending Merger has not been completed by July 31, 2019.

Our Segments
During 2018, we operated our business through five reportable segments as follows:

The resulting products are sold via pipeline, truck, and rail. 
AMID NGL Trucking (Formerly part of COSL)
We operate a fleet of 23 trucks in East Texas that assist in our NGL gathering and product delivery efforts. 
6

Burns Point
Burns Point Plant is a cryogenic processing plant that is jointly owned by us and the plant operator, Enterprise Gas Processing, LLC ("Enterprise"). We hold a 50% undivided, non-operated interest in the Burns Point Plant. We acquired an interest in the asset group and not in a legal entity. We and Enterprise are proportionately liable for the liabilities. Outside of the rights and responsibilities of the operator, we and Enterprise have equal rights and obligations to the assets. Significant non-capital and maintenance capital expenditures, plant expansions and significant plant dispositions require the approval of both owners. The plant has been shut down since December 2017 due to maintenance issues and is expected to remain shut down. We are in the process of working with Enterprise to wind down operations.
Offshore Texas System
The Offshore Texas System consists of the GIGS and Brazos systems, which have approximately 56 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from six to sixteen inches and a design capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d. The Offshore Texas System is in a position to provide gathering and dehydration services to natural gas producers in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas. Since 2016, the offshore pipe on both systems was abandoned, and the onshore pipe was out of service. Although we have no ongoing operations, we continue to hold the pipeline asset as we believe it may have potential future value.

Results of operations from the Gas Gathering and Processing Services segment are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas we gather, process and fractionate, the commercial terms in our current contract portfolio and natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate prices. We gather and process natural gas primarily pursuant to the following arrangements:

Fee-Based Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we generally are paid a fixed fee for gathering, processing and transporting natural gas.

Fixed-Margin Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas liquids and condensate from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price and sell that volume of natural gas liquids or condensate at delivery points on our systems at a higher price versus a comparable price. By entering into purchases and sales of natural gas liquids or condensate on comparable indices, we are able to lock in a fixed margin on these transactions. We view the segment gross margin earned under our fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to the fee earned in our fee-based arrangements.
Percent-of-Proceeds Arrangements (“POP”). Under these arrangements, we generally gather raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead or other supply points, transport it through our gathering system, process it and sell the residue natural gas, NGLs and condensate at market prices. Where we provide processing services at the processing plants that we own, or obtain processing services for our own account in connection with our elective processing arrangements, we generally retain and sell a percentage of the residue natural gas and resulting NGLs. However, we also have contracts under which we retain a percentage of the resulting NGLs and do not retain a percentage of residue natural gas. Our POP arrangements also often contain a fee-based component.
Our Gas Gathering and Processing Services assets are located in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas and in shallow state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana and are positioned in areas with opportunities for organic growth. We continually seek new sources of raw natural gas and crude oil supply to maintain and increase the throughput volume on our gathering systems and through our processing plants.
Gross margin earned under fee-based and fixed-margin arrangements is directly related to the volume of natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate that flow through our systems and is not directly dependent on commodity prices. However, a sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a decline in throughput from producers and, thus, a decrease in our fee-based and fixed-margin gross margin. These arrangements provide stable cash flows, but upside in higher commodity-price environments is limited to an increase in throughput from producers. Under our typical POP arrangement, our gross margin is directly impacted by the commodity prices we realize on our share of natural gas and NGLs received as compensation for processing raw natural gas. However, our POP arrangements often contain a fee-based component, which helps to mitigate the degree of commodity-price volatility we could experience under these arrangements. We further seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through our hedging program. For more information see Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Commodity Price Risk of this 2018 Form 10-K.

Liquid Pipelines and Services Segment
In our Liquid Pipelines and Services segment, we have the following assets:
Bakken System
The Bakken system is a FERC-regulated crude oil gathering pipeline system that consists of a 47-mile pipeline and related facilities with capacity to transport up to approximately 81,600 Bbl/d of crude oil to the Tesoro Logistics pipeline located Northeast of Watford City, North Dakota and the Energy Transfer Dakota Access Pipeline. The system, which commenced operations in October 2015, provides producers in the area with access to refinery, rail and pipeline markets. The system also has the capability to receive volumes through its truck rack, which also commenced operations in November 2015. 
Silver Dollar Pipeline
The Silver Dollar Pipeline located in the Permian Basin and consists of an approximately 186-mile pipeline and related facilities with capacity to transport approximately 125,000 Bbl/d of crude oil. The pipeline was constructed in 2013.
Crude Oil Supply and Logistics (COSL) 
Our Marketing business operates around both crude pipeline assets and trucking hubs. We buy and sell crude in North Dakota and Texas to facilitate movements on our pipelines. We have a fleet of 65 crude oil trucks which support West Texas and South Texas.
Cushing
Our crude oil storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma has an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 3.0 million barrels. We generate crude oil storage revenues by charging customers a fixed monthly fee per barrel of shell capacity that is not contingent on the customer's actual usage of our storage tanks, i.e., take-or-pay firm storage contracts. 
Other Systems
Tri-States, Cayenne and Wilprise are also part of the Liquid Pipelines and Services segment and are listed under Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates below. 
Results of operations from the Liquid Pipelines and Services segment are determined by the volumes of crude oil transported on pipelines and related facilities that we own. Our transportation arrangements are further described below:

Committed Shipper Arrangements. Our obligation to provide transportation service to committed shippers means that, pursuant to agreements with the shippers, and subject to applicable tariff provisions, we transport crude oil nominated by shippers in quantities specified in the applicable agreements.  In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified committed shipper rate for quantities of crude actually transported, whether or not the shipper utilizes the capacity. 
Uncommitted Shipper Arrangements. Our obligation to provide uncommitted shipper service means that we are only obligated to transport crude oil nominated by shippers to the extent that we have available capacity.  For this service the shippers pay an uncommitted shipper rate for quantities actually shipped.

Fee-Based Arrangements. Under these arrangements our operations are underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts with leading producers in the Midland Basin. Some of these contracts also have minimum volume commitments as well as some have acreage dedications.

Crude Oil Purchase Arrangements. We enter into outright purchase and sales contracts with counterparties, under which contracts we gather and transport different types of crude oil and eventually sell the crude oil to different counterparties.  We account for such revenue arrangements on a gross basis.

Natural Gas Transportation Services Segment
In our Natural Gas Transportation Services segment, we have the following assets:

Results of operations from the Natural Gas Transportation Services segment are determined by a capacity reservation charge from firm transportation contracts, a variable-use or commodity charge for firm and interruptible transportation contracts, and the volumes of natural gas transported on the interstate and intrastate pipelines we own pursuant to interruptible transportation or fixed-margin contracts. Our transportation arrangements are further described below:

Firm Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide firm transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we transport natural gas nominated by the shipper up to the maximum daily quantity specified in the contract. In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified reservation charge, whether or not the shipper utilizes the capacity. In most cases, the shipper also pays a variable-use or commodity charge with respect to quantities actually transported by us.

Interruptible Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide interruptible transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we only transport natural gas nominated by the shipper to the extent that we have available capacity. For this service the shipper pays no reservation charge but pays a variable-use or commodity charge for quantities actually shipped.

Fixed-Margin Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas at delivery points on our systems at the same undiscounted index price. We view fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to our interruptible transportation arrangements.
Offshore Pipelines and Services Segment
In our Offshore Pipelines and Services segment, we have the following assets:
High Point System 
The High Point system consists of natural gas and liquids pipeline assets located in southeast Louisiana and the shallow water and deep shelf Gulf of Mexico.

Results of operations from the Offshore Pipelines and Services segment are determined by capacity reservation fees from firm and interruptible transportation contracts and the volumes of natural gas transported on the interstate and intrastate pipelines we own pursuant to interruptible transportation or fixed-margin contracts. Our transportation arrangements are further described below:

Firm Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide firm transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we transport natural gas nominated by the shipper up to the maximum daily quantity specified in the contract. In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified reservation charge, whether or not the shipper utilizes the capacity. In most cases, the shipper also pays a variable-use charge with respect to quantities actually transported by us.

Interruptible Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide interruptible transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we only transport natural gas nominated by the shipper to the extent that we have available capacity. For this service the shipper pays no reservation charge but pays a variable-use charge for quantities actually shipped.

Fixed-Margin Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas at delivery points on our systems at the same undiscounted index price. We view fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to our interruptible transportation arrangements.

Currently, we and ArcLight indirectly own a 35.7% and 23.3% interest, respectively, in Delta House.
Cayenne
On August 8, 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Targa Midstream Services, LLC (“Targa”) through our previously wholly owned subsidiary Cayenne. We received $5.0 million in cash in exchange for the sale of 50% ownership interest in Cayenne to Targa. The sole asset of the joint venture is a natural gas pipeline, which has been converted into a natural gas liquids pipeline. Both parties have 50% economic interests and 50% voting rights, with Targa serving as the operator of the pipeline and the joint venture. The additional costs of conversion and associated construction are shared equally by us and Targa. The pipeline became operational on December 28, 2017.
Okeanos
We own a 66.7% operated interest in Okeanos, a 100-mile natural gas gathering system located in the Gulf of Mexico with a total capacity of 1.0 Bcf/d. The Okeanos pipeline connects two platforms and one lateral, terminating at the Destin Main Pass 260 platform in the Mississippi Canyon region of the Gulf of Mexico. Contracted volumes on the Okeanos pipeline are based on life-of-field dedication.
Destin
We own a 66.7% operated interest in Destin, a FERC-regulated, 255-mile natural gas transport system with total capacity of 1.2 Bcf/d. The system originates offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and includes connections with four producing platforms and six producer-operated laterals, including Delta House. The 120-mile offshore portion of the Destin system terminates at the Pascagoula processing plant, owned by Enterprise Products Partners, LP, and is the single source of raw natural gas to the plant. The onshore portion of Destin is the sole delivery point for merchant-quality gas from the Pascagoula processing plant and extends 135 miles north in Mississippi. Destin currently serves as the primary transfer of gas flows from the Barnett and Haynesville Shale plays to Florida markets through interconnections with major interstate pipelines. Contracted volumes on the Destin pipeline are based on life-of-field dedication, dedicated volumes over a given period or interruptible volumes as capacity permits.
Wilprise
We own a 25.3% non-operated interest in Wilprise, a FERC-regulated, approximately 30-mile NGL pipeline that originates at the Kenner Junction and terminates in Sorrento, Louisiana, where volumes flow via pipeline to a Baton Rouge fractionator.
Tri-States
We own a 16.7% non-operated interest in Tri-States, a FERC-regulated, 161-mile NGL pipeline and sole form of transport to Louisiana-based fractionators for NGLs produced at the Pascagoula plant served by Destin and other facilities.

Competition 
The midstream business is very competitive, with a number of publicly traded and private equity backed entities servicing the space based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and efficiencies. Competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and/or NGLs. Competition is also increased in those geographic areas where our commercial contracts with our customers are shorter term and therefore must be renegotiated on a more frequent basis. An increase in competition could result from new pipeline, processing facility, or storage installations or expansions of existing facilities.  Major competitors in various aspects of our business include: DCP Midstream LLC; Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.; EnLink NGL Marketing, L.P.; Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP; Enbridge Inc; Columbia Gulf Transmission Company; Enterprise Gas Processing, LLC; Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.; Medallion Pipeline Company, LLC; Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP; Southern Natural Gas Company; Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, LLC; Texas Eastern Pipeline; and The Williams Companies, Inc, among others.

Regulation of our Operations
Safety and Maintenance
We are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 ("NGPSA"), and by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 ("PSIA"), which was reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in "high-consequence areas," such as high population areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, which became law in January 2012, increases the penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. PHMSA also issued its final rule for hazardous liquids pipelines on January 23, 2017. That rule extends regulatory reporting requirements to all liquid gathering lines, requires additional event-driven and periodic inspections, requires use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modifies repair criteria and requires certain pipelines to eventually accommodate inline inspection tools. This rule went into effect on March 24, 2017. In March 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding natural gas pipelines that would amend existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. While we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines not previously subject to such requirements. Costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time the terms of any new laws or rules or the costs of compliance associated with such requirements.
In addition, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety and Superfund
13

We and the entities in which we own an interest are subject to:

• | EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, also known as the Risk Management Plan requirements, which are designed to prevent the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials; and


• | Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities.

Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Our interstate natural gas transportation systems are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"). Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Additionally, costs associated with compliance with these and other FERC regulations and policies could be severe and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Federal regulation of our interstate pipelines extends to such matters as:

• | rates, services and terms and conditions of service;


• | the types of services offered to customers;


• | the certification and construction of new facilities;


• | the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;


• | the maintenance of accounts and records;


• | relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business;


• | the initiation and discontinuation of services;


• | market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas; and


• | participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements.

Under the NGA, the rates for service on these interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.
The rates and terms and conditions for our interstate pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to FERC's jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. Any successful complaint or protest against our rates could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with providing transportation service.
Section 311 Pipelines
Intrastate transportation of natural gas is largely regulated by the state in which such transportation takes place. To the extent that our intrastate natural gas transportation systems transport natural gas in interstate commerce without an exemption under the NGA, the rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA, and Part 284 of the FERC's regulations. Pipelines providing transportation service under Section 311 are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311, rates charged for intrastate transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate facility's statement of operating conditions are also subject to FERC's review and approval. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than our currently approved Section 311 rates, our business may be adversely affected. Failure to comply with applicable FERC regulations for Section 311 service or a FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in alteration of jurisdictional status and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.
Hinshaw Pipelines
Intrastate natural gas pipelines are defined as pipelines that operate entirely within a single state, and generally are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction under the NGA. Hinshaw pipelines, by definition, also operate within a single state, but can receive gas from outside their state without becoming subject to FERC's NGA jurisdiction if (1) they receive natural gas at or within the boundary of a state, (2) all the gas is consumed within that state and (3) the pipeline is regulated by a state commission. Following the enactment of the NGPA, the FERC issued Order No. 63 authorizing Hinshaw pipelines to apply for authorization to transport natural gas in interstate commerce in the same manner as intrastate pipelines operating pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Hinshaw pipelines frequently operate pursuant to blanket certificates to provide transportation and sales service under the FERC's regulations.
14

Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Our natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. The states in which we operate have adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no material adverse effect to our system due to these regulations.
Market Behavior Rules
On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005, ("EP Act 2005"). Among other matters, the EP Act 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by FERC and, furthermore, provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of the EP Act 2005. The rules make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but only to the extent such transactions do not have a "nexus" to jurisdictional transactions. The EP Act 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes, up to $1,000,000 per day per violation which is adjusted periodically for inflation. In connection with this enhanced civil penalty authority, FERC issued a policy statement on enforcement to provide guidance regarding the enforcement of the statutes, orders, rules and regulations it administers, including factors to be considered in determining the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rule, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
Interstate Oil and Liquids Pipeline Regulation
Our Bakken crude oil gathering system, FERC-regulated American Panther, LLC offshore liquids pipelines (known as the Tiger Shoals and MP 77 offshore pipeline systems) and the Tri-States and Wilprise NGL pipelines, in which we have equity investments, are regulated as common carrier interstate pipelines by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EP Act 1992”) and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. Under the ICA, FERC has authority regarding the rates and terms and conditions of service for the transportation of oil and natural gas liquids in interstate commerce. The ICA and FERC’s regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate service on common carrier pipelines be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC’s regulations also require interstate common carrier pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service.
In general, interstate common carrier pipeline rates are initially set through negotiations with non-affiliated shippers or via cost of service ratemaking. In addition, rates can be set via settlement agreed to by all shippers and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. 
Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. FERC could require a common carrier pipeline to collect rates subject to refund until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms.
15

A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period the rate was in effect, if any. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively, and may require a common carrier pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.
Offshore Pipelines
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ("BOEM") manages the exploration and development of the nation's offshore resources. BOEM seeks to appropriately balance economic development, energy independence and environmental protection through crude oil and gas leases, renewable energy development and environmental reviews and studies. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement works to promote safety, protect the environment and conserve resources offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement.
Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs
The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Sales of NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could enact price controls in the future.
As discussed above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas pipelines and those initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas both directly and indirectly.
Environmental Matters
General
Our operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for the gathering, compressing, treating and transporting of natural gas and other products is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. 
16

We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather, compress, treat and transport natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs, and future events may impose costs on our business in excess of our expectations, and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate little hazardous waste; however, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. 
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated soil and groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition. Future contamination may expose us to costs in excess of our expectation, and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Air Quality and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our compressor stations and processing plants, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties and may result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources. Although we can give no assurances, we believe such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results, and the requirements are not expected to be more burdensome to us than to any similarly situated company. 
A number of states have adopted or considered programs to reduce “greenhouse gases,” or GHGs, and the EPA has declared that GHGs “endanger” public health and welfare and is regulating GHG emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks. The EPA has also published various rules relating to the mandatory reporting of GHG emissions, including mandatory reporting of requirements of GHGs from petroleum and natural gas systems.
17

The permitting, regulatory compliance and reporting programs taken as a whole increase the costs and complexity of operating oil and gas operations. This may adversely affect our cost of doing business and demand for the oil and gas we transport. We may also be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act ("Clean Water Act"), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the U.S. and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure ("SPCC") requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Safe Drinking Water Act
The underground injection of crude oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership is in compliance with the requirements. 
Anti-terrorism Measures
The federal Department of Homeland Security regulates the security of chemical and industrial facilities pursuant to regulations known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. These regulations apply to oil and gas facilities, among others, that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” Pursuant to these regulations, certain of our facilities are required to comply with certain regulatory provisions, including requirements regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information. 
Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way
Our real property falls into two categories: i) parcels that we own in fee and ii) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remaining land on which our plant sites and major facilities are located, are held by us pursuant to surface leases. easements, rights of way, permits or licenses between us and the fee owner of the lands. Our predecessors leased or owned these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership in such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
Employees
The Partnership does not have any employees. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by our General Partner, and the officers of our General Partner manage our operations and activities. As of December 31, 2018, our General Partner employed approximately 480 people who provide direct, full-time support to our operations. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our General Partner considers its employee relations to be positive.
