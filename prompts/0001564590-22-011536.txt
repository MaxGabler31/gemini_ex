Item 1. Business 
 Bowman is a professional services firm delivering innovative engineering solutions to customers who own, develop, and maintain the built environment. We provide planning, engineering, construction management, commissioning, environmental consulting, geomatics, survey, land procurement and other technical services to over 3,000 customers operating in a diverse set of end markets.
 Gary Bowman, our President, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and largest stockholder, founded Bowman in 1995. Over the past 10 years, we have experienced a roughly four-fold increase in revenue to $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We are currently ranked 144th on the ENR Top 500 Design Firms list. We have achieved this growth through both organic expansion and acquisitions. Our workforce of over 1,000 employees, as of December 31, 2021, provides services to over 3,000 active customer projects from 40 offices throughout the United States.
 We work as both a prime and sub-consultant for a broad base of public and private sector customers that generally operate in highly regulated environments. Our public sector assignments originate from customers that are utilities, government agencies (federal, state, and local), military branches, school systems, transportation departments and water authorities. Our private sector assignments originate from customers that operate in commercial markets including data centers, renewable energy, residential and commercial real estate, big-box and convenience retail, mining, and healthcare.
 We are committed to promoting inclusion and engagement, principles we believe are critical to our success. We continue to focus on the hiring, retention, and advancement of a representative workforce. We have focused our recent efforts in four areas: inspiring innovation through an engaging culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire diverse talent; advocating and facilitating internal affinity groups; and identifying opportunities to implement environmental, social and governance initiatives. We are defined by our core values and purpose. Our culture revolves around a top to bottom commitment to the relentless creation of opportunities for aspiring people to thrive and achieve ambitious goals.
 We have a diversified business that is not dependent on any one service line, geographic region, or end market. We are deliberate in our efforts to balance our sources of revenue and avoid reliance on any one significant customer, service line, geography, or end market concentration. As a result, we believe our business is resilient and less likely affected by political and economic cycles.
 We develop and maintain loyal and long-standing relationships with our customers that result in repeat assignments, which we believe benefits us through lower business development and client acquisition expenses as compared to those associated with developing new customers. Our strategic focus is on penetrating and expanding our presence in markets which best afford us opportunities to secure assignments that provide reoccurring revenue and multi-year engagements. These engagements typically produce dependable and predictable revenue streams with high employee utilization which leads to increased profitability. Approximately 25% and 22% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were derived from multi-year contracts which we consider to be reoccurring revenue assignments.
 While our business is not subject to significant regulation, the services we provide to our customers address various federal, state and local regulations that must be complied with to receive approval to proceed. In connection with the process of bidding for and being awarded certain government assignments we are required to provide an annual Federal Acquisition Regulation rate audit that determines our overhead reimbursement allowance. With respect to the operation of our business, we are subject to professional licensing requirements that vary by state.
 Each state establishes licensing and organizational requirements for our services. Certain states allow only individuals and individually owned professional services corporations to hold licenses. In those states, there may be grandfathering exemptions that allow corporations to hold licenses. In the event a state does not allow a corporation to hold a license, we have in the past formed professional services corporations owned by Mr. Bowman and other employees to facilitate our ability to work in such states. In connection with our initial public offering we purchased a qualified North Carolina corporation (see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Consolidating Transactions in Connection with our Initial Public Offering). To the extent we cannot adequately satisfy a state’s licensing requirements, we do not operate in that state. As of December 31, 2021, we were licensed to operate in 45 states.
 During our 25 years in the engineering and consulting business, we have worked with such clients and on such well-known projects as (in alphabetical order):

 The time between contract assignment, notice to proceed and completion varies by customer and assignment. As we secure assignments we accrete our backlog of unbilled revenue and as we execute on assignments, we deplete our backlog of unbilled revenue. New and continuing assignments from existing customers, business development efforts and acquisitions fuel the growth of our backlog. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $167 million of gross backlog representing a trailing 13 months of a gross revenue and a 47.8% compound annual growth rate from our backlog of $113 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $145 million of net backlog representing 86.5% of our gross backlog. Net backlog is our gross backlog exclusive of subconsultant costs and other direct expenses. 
 We are deliberate about managing risk and therefore limit our exposure by providing professional and related services exclusively. We do not engage in general contracting activities either directly, or through joint ventures, and therefore have no related exposure. We are not a partner in any design-build construction projects, and we carry no equipment inventory. Our risk of contract loss is generally limited to the cost of internal labor cost associated with fixed fee, professional services assignments. 
 We have substantial experience with acquisitions. Over the past ten years, we have successfully completed 25 acquisitions of engineering and consulting services companies. Through these acquisitions, we have established new geographic footprints, added service lines, increased our depth of leadership, expanded our end markets, and enhanced our portfolio of experience. Our industry is highly fragmented presenting opportunity to build scale through consolidation. We are continuously active in the market for acquisitions maintaining a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Our acquisition strategy is to identify targets that align with our culture and permit rapid integration rendering the acquired entity’s operations fully consolidated into ours within one year.

Competitive Strengths 
 We are an agile, growth-oriented engineering services firm committed to providing essential technical and professional services to a broad base of long-term and repeat customers. The recurring needs of our customers for technical services to monetize and operate their assets makes us essential to their ongoing operations. Our commitment to quality and reliability with respect to designs, plans and customer service has enabled us to create durable, long-term customer relationships. We serve over 2,500 customers with more than 65% having engaged with us for multiple assignments over the past three years. We deliberately focus many of our business pursuits in environments where laws and regulations create a level of complexity that places a premium on the value of our services, thereby providing us openings to develop new customer loyalty through creative problem solving. Our base of repeat customers and multi-year contracts reduce our customer acquisition expenses and provide increased visibility into future revenues, allowing us to make investments confidently to expand and take market share from competitors. We believe our competitive strengths include:
 National scale and brand. Our professional staff of over 1,000 employees, as of December 31, 2021, operate out of 40 core offices and 18 states. Our scale has helped to create a national brand within our industry associated with quality and timely delivery of technical services. The reputation of our brand allows us to extend existing customer relationships, efficiently attract new customers and recruit and retain a credentialed and representative workforce. The strategic locations of our offices support broad recruiting capabilities while the integrated nature of our technology enables flexible remote work and efficient cross-utilization of both work experience and production resources thereby enhancing profitability. Our diversified geography increases our sources of revenue and income, thereby insulating us from concentrated economic or political disruptions.
 Resilient, low-risk business model. We believe that the market for the engineering and related technical services that we perform is generally resilient to long-lasting economic cyclicality and that our business model results in lower risk relative to our competitors. Our revenue is not concentrated with any customer, geography, end market, or service line. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our top 10 customers represented 27% and 34%, respectively, of our net service billing. Our largest expense is labor, which can be adaptively aligned with changing market conditions. We operate an asset-light model that leverages advanced design, data analytics and geospatial technologies to enhance the productivity of our mobile and adaptable workforce. We further control risk by working with established, credit worthy customers. Our focus on long-term and multi-year assignments results in a significant backlog of contracted work providing reliable visibility to near and mid-term revenue that enable us to proactively anticipate and adjust staff needs. Additionally, we limit our financial risk by not engaging in general contracting activities, exposing ourselves to substantial construction risk or posting bid or performance bonds.
 Dedicated founder, experienced leadership team, valuable technical workforce, and entrepreneurial culture. Gary Bowman has led our Company since its founding in 1995. In his position as President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bowman sets the Company’s vision, guides the establishment of its strategic objective, and leads its executive team. Mr. Bowman’s connection with our customers and staff is rooted in over 40 years of experience in our industry. As our largest stockholder, Mr. Bowman is committed to actively leading the Company and maintaining a substantial ownership position for the long-term future.
 Our senior executive team is highly experienced, with an average tenure of over 35 years in their respective areas of responsibility. The team has a proven record of accomplishment with respect to driving organic growth, executing, and integrating acquisitions, implementing internal controls, and managing regulatory compliance. The members of our board of directors are all highly accomplished senior executives with extensive private and public business experience.
 We have a highly technical workforce of over 1,000 employees, as of December 31, 2021, of which more than 23% hold certifications by various  industry and regulatory bodies. Our dedication to growth of opportunity for our employees has enabled us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We embody a set of cultural values that promote entrepreneurship, personal growth, and responsibility. We are committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in our workforce. We have built an organization uniformly aligned in its mission, values, purpose, and goals.
 Proven ability to grow both organically and through acquisition. Over the past ten years, our annual revenues have grown roughly four-fold to approximately $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have accelerated our growth by identifying and closing acquisitions of companies with workforces that align with our culture. Fundamental to our successful record of growth has been our leadership team’s ability to identify, execute and integrate strategic acquisitions whereby we expand into new geographies, add new capabilities to generate organic growth and extend our industry-leading platform. Our acquisition integration approach rapidly facilitates cross-cultivation of experiences, employee collaboration and cross selling of services. Historically, within a year’s time, acquired companies become fully integrated within our overall operations. 
 Industry Overview 
 Our operations encompass nearly every aspect of the U.S. domestic built environment. We provide planning, engineering, construction management, commissioning, environmental consulting, geomatics, survey, land procurement and other technical services to markets that develop and manage the buildings in which people live, work, and learn; the systems that manage and distribute water,

electricity, and other vital services; the roads, bridges, and transportation systems used to get from place to place; and the safeguards that ensure public health and safety every day. Our public sector customers include government agencies (federal, state, and local), military branches, educational institutions, transportation departments and water authorities. Our private sector customers include investor-owned utilities, participants in the renewable energy marketplace, owners of data centers, developers and owners of residential and commercial real estate, operators of big-box and convenience retail chains, and mining concerns.
 The market for engineering services in the United States is large, with an expected total revenue of $204 billion in 2020, according to IBISWorld. With over 130,000 firms, a large proportion of whom are small-scale organizations focused on specific local markets or specialized niches, the industry is extremely fragmented. As reported in Engineering News-Record, the 500 largest firms in our industry generated approximately $86 billion in revenue in 2019 within the United States, with the ten largest firms accounting for $27 billion of that revenue. According to IBISWorld, from 2015 through 2019 the market for engineering services grew at a modest rate due to increasing construction activity. IBISWorld projects the industry will grow at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the next five years and increase to $234 billion in revenue by 2025.
 As with most fragmented industries with extensive participation of privately held companies there is an active market for ownership transition and consolidation activity, with larger participants actively engaging in growth through acquisitions. The technical complexity of most projects performed in the industry effectively restricts the free flow of new entrants, limiting participation to those with demonstrated capacities across a range of projects. Qualifications, sophisticated technical skills, expertise, and scale are prerequisites for successful industry participation. Companies aspiring to enter the market must have sufficient skilled human capital to complete complex projects, and the financial resources to provide adequate risk management and cover working capital requirements. These factors serve as both a barrier to entry and a catalyst for consolidation. 
 Our Markets 
 We have strategically and deliberately diversified the number of markets that we serve to reduce our dependence on any single market segment and to dampen the effects of business cycles in our markets. While we are bullish on all the market spaces that we currently occupy, we intend to especially focus our growth initiatives on markets that possess the following characteristics: 

• | High potential for reoccurring revenue and multi-year assignments
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engagement with renewable energy, energy transition, and energy efficiency activities
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aging and failing infrastructure in need of upgrade and replacement
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transformational investment paradigms such as privatization
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Economic vitality and attractive growth in population and workforce
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory complexity
--+----------------------

 The markets we serve typically require participants to engage with several of our services, affording us the opportunity to cross sell, optimize revenue potential, and differentiate ourselves as a single source supplier. 
 We have a significant presence in each of the following markets we currently serve: 
 Power and Utilities 
 Much of the power, gas, and water infrastructure in the U.S. has reached or passed its useful life span. Major power outages due to increasingly severe weather events is a growing problem which the Department of Energy estimates is costing the U.S. at least $150 billion per year. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates the cost to move the U.S. to a smarter national grid with better protection against major outages to be somewhere between $338 billion and $476 billion. Utilities, policy makers, and communities have agreed for years that the aging electric transmission and distribution grid in the U.S. needs to be substantially upgraded to withstand the challenges of the future. The U.S. power grid faces unrelenting pressure to increase resiliency and to integrate technologies such as electric vehicles, distributed generation, and battery storage, as well as to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure. The proliferation of data centers, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence with its associated electrical demand is straining the U.S. power grid and creating a sense of urgency around maintenance and upgrade. According to the ASCE Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, the U.S. electric infrastructure will require capital investment of $637 billion over the next ten years. 
 Degradation of the safety and sustainability of natural gas distribution systems is advancing the infusion of public investment and private, returns- driven capital. The entrance of private capital into the historically public utility market, and the associated timely demand for return on investment, has catalyzed the pace of multi-year expenditures on critical infrastructure. As reported by The Council of State Governments, natural gas utilities spend $19 billion annually to enhance the safety of the natural gas system. Examples of our multi-year reoccurring revenue assignments in the utilities space include undergrounding of electric distribution lines, procurement of rights-of-way and easements, gas distribution system mapping, and design for gas distribution pipeline replacement.

We serve end clients in the power and utility space such as AEP, Dominion Energy, Florida Power and Light, Lower Colorado River Authority, NiSource Columbia Gas, Southwest Gas, Peoples Gas of Illinois, and Tampa Electric. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Power and Utilities represented 15.0% and 16.7%, respectively, of our gross contract revenues. 
 Transportation 
 Utilization of transportation infrastructure within the domestic built environment far exceeds its intended capacity. The aging of the current installed transportation base and increasing load usage are forcing public authorities either to increase the capacity of their systems or privatize the operation of their roads, bridges, and tollways. The transportation market has experienced broad increases in federal funding from U.S. Department of Transportation initiatives as well as explosive for-profit privatization. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that nearly a quarter of the nation’s bridges are deficient and require replacement or rehabilitation.
 Economic and population growth in major metropolitan areas will drive demand for spending on expanded roadway capacity. The ASCE Infrastructure Report Card rates the state of the U.S. Highway system as “D+” and estimates spending requirements of over $2.5 trillion over the next ten years on U.S. surface transportation infrastructure. Providing construction management services to departments of transportation and toll authorities has been a proven and dependable source of multi-year and reoccurring revenue.
 We serve public and private transportation customers that include Ferrovial, Florida Department of Transportation, Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, Texas Department of Transportation, and Virginia Department of Transportation.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Transportation represented 11.0% and 15.7%, respectively, of our gross contract revenue. 
 Building Infrastructure
 Encompassing all the places we live, sleep, work, and play, this market is foundationally aligned with all day-to-day factors that are either influenced by or influence economic activity. Fueled by the commitment of the current Federal Reserve Bank to maintain historically low interest rates, changing population demographics, and evolving remote work dynamics, the market for design, construction and maintenance of new and renewed building infrastructure presents us with continually expanding opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has, however, introduced an element of uncertainty as to the continued growth of the market for building infrastructure.
 Residential. Several factors align to produce durable tailwinds for the housing market. A decade into the recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, home sales have yet to recover from pre-recession highs. Over the same period, there was a rapid expansion of the rental housing market as the large millennial generation entered the prime life stage for housing. From 2005 until 2016, growth in renter households outpaced growth in owner households. However, that trend is now reversing. According to tradingeconomics.com, U.S. homeownership peaked at 69.2% in 2004, reached a nadir of 63.7% in 2016, and averaged 66.9% over the first three quarters of 2020. Reinforcing the positive homeownership driver, in our belief, is the remote working trend spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in further exurban migration and will accelerate new ‘outer-ring’ housing construction. Builder optimism is currently highest in the West and South which, according to Wells Fargo accounted for 80% of single-family starts in the third quarter of 2020; regions where we have a well-established presence in the residential market. Our history serving the residential market goes back to our beginning and we work for most of the large national homebuilders including Lennar Homes, NV Homes, Richmond American Homes, and Toll Brothers.
 Commercial and Retail. Changes in shopping and consuming habits spurred by e-commerce, accelerated by stay at home trends and orders, have, in our belief, resulted in a massive reconfiguration of commercial and retail physical plant along with the configuration of their surrounding site elements. Brands are rushing to the detachment experience due to fear of an enduring pandemic environment. As an example, a large coffee shop chain as part of an initiative to “increase convenience-led formats” in the U.S. including both drive-thru and curbside pickup options, closed 400 traditional locations in North America while adding 300 net new convenience-oriented locations throughout North America in their place. Savvy and well capitalized developers and operators in this market will continue to demand our services in response to evolving market forces. We serve national retailers such as Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Circle K, Starbucks, and Whataburger.
 Institutional and Government.  As our economy and population grows, the market to construct new, expanded, and modernized government facilities, educational structures, military installations, and mission critical complexes expands continuously. State and local governments experience increasing demand from their constituents for safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly facilities. Evolving demographics and associated demands for municipal and recreational services are increasing the need for new and updated government infrastructure. Communities are placing a growing emphasis of focus on environmental impact and sustainability as seen through the

7

implementation of smart- and green-building technologies in new and retrofit facilities. As the economy reopens and building occupancies recover to pre-pandemic states, we believe there will be a tremendous demand for retrofits of ventilation, air handling, air quality monitoring, and filtration systems in order to ensure healthier indoor environments necessary to mitigate the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. We have served institutional and government clients such as American University, George Washington University, GSA, INOVA Health System, Loudoun County Schools, National Reconnaissance Office, New Jersey Institute of Technology, O’Hare International Airport, Rutgers University, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Army, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Building infrastructure represented 70.2% and 63.0%, respectively, of our gross contract revenue.
 We are engaged in activities in each of the following markets which we consider to be emerging opportunities.
 Renewable Energy
 Renewable energy encompasses all activities supporting the energy sector’s transition away from fossil-based systems of energy production in favor of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, as well as lithium-ion batteries. According to Wood Mackenzie, (i) wind and solar will increase three-fold over the next twenty years to account for 30% of U.S. power generation by the year 2040, (ii) electric vehicle units will increase from 11 million to 323 million by the year 2040, supplanting traditional gas and diesel vehicles in the process, and (iii) the U.S. will need to invest one trillion dollars per year in new energy capacity over the next 20 years to meet the demands of economic growth and energy transition. In its report Renewables 2020—Analysis and forecast to 2025, the International Energy Agency predicts that renewables are expected to account for 95% of the net increase in global power capacity through 2025. During that period, the share of renewables in electricity generation is forecast to grow from 27% in 2020 to 33% in 2025. Furthermore, during the 2020-2025 forecast period, combined wind and solar capacity is expected to double, achieving two important milestones: their total installed capacity is expected to surpass that of natural gas in 2023 and that of coal in 2024. During that time, Business Wire forecasts an annual growth rate of more than 15% for the highly fragmented United States solar energy market alone.
 Limited natural resources, increasing demand and disruptive innovation are driving consequential private and public investment in the expansion of renewable energy facilities. Increasing demand for industrial grade renewable infrastructure and expanded capacity within existing facilities create an exceptional depth of opportunity for the sale of our services. We provide planning, environmental consulting, land procurement, civil and electrical engineering, and program management services to customers in the renewable energy space.
 We serve solar developers, wind developers, and battery storage developers in the renewable energy space such as AEP Renewables, Broadreach Power, Dominion Energy, First Solar, Onyx Renewable Partners, Rynova, Samsung C&T America, Solis Energy, S-Power, and Sun Tribe Power.
 Energy Efficiency
 Recent acquisitions have provided us the capability and reputation needed to enter the energy efficiency market. Energy efficiency plays a pivotal role in advancing sustainable development within the global economy. Efforts to decarbonize the global energy system and advance the world’s climate objectives are dependent on improving energy efficiency. Technologies and applications such as distributed generation, microgrids, the internet of things, energy as a service, and cogeneration are transforming how we produce, distribute, and consume energy.
 As an example of the growth potential of this market, Fortune Business Insights forecasts the global market for the energy-as-a-service market to grow at a compound growth rate of about 12% over the next seven years. The research firm of Markets and Markets forecasts that the global market for microgrids will grow at a compound growth rate of about 10% over the next five years. We view the energy efficiency market as one that is synergistic with the renewable energy market as well as the power and utilities market. Consequently, we intend to focus much of our acquisition effort and resources in this direction.
 Water Resources 
 Water is essential to our lives and to the communities we live in making it critical that we create a sustainable future for our water supply. Balancing the world’s needs for safe, reliable water with protection of this critical natural resource for the future requires a deep understanding of multiple interconnected systems. As water supplies become scarce and in increasing need of protection, and infrastructure needs increase contemporaneously, we collaborate with our customers to develop sustainable solutions to their water, wastewater, and water resources challenges. Our team of water professionals provides water supply distribution and treatment, wastewater collection and treatment, and asset management engineering and consulting services to customers. Rapid urbanization, industrial growth, suburban sprawl, and depleting sources of fresh water are increasing domestic demand for water and wastewater solutions. Expanding regulations governing the treatment, distribution and storage of water resources will intensify demand for adaptive water and wastewater treatment solutions. We assist municipalities, county agencies, public utilities, and private clients in addressing

8

their potable water and wastewater challenges. Our expertise with water solutions ranges from planning, design, construction management, and funding identification. We serve the water resource needs of a variety of customers including the U.S. Navy, Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Fairfax County Water Authority, and Loudoun Water.
 Mining
 Mining facilities require a variety of generally and specialty engineering services we provide. We primarily serve the Southwest U.S. copper mining industry where we have developed specialized capabilities over time. Copper is buoyed by both near and long-term favorable fundamentals. Chinese demand for copper is exceptionally strong, and stimulus and pandemic recovery are expected to support economic growth that will stimulate additional copper demand. More important, policy driven decarbonization targets are accelerating and copper is a critical component for electric vehicles, charging stations, high-efficiency motors, and renewable energy. According to the International Copper Association, electric vehicles use up to four times as much copper as internal combustion vehicles and renewable energy power generation uses four to five times as much copper as fossil fuel power generation. Copper is crucial for connecting and advancing development of core technologies and smart cities, including artificial intelligence, smart grids, 5G technologies, mobile phones and computers. A study conducted by the Martec group found that the total volume of copper in smart city technology is predicted to rise from 2.7 million tons in 2019 to 4.8 million tons in 2025. Supply of copper is limited due to an aging base supply, limited numbers of in-progress and planned expansion projects, and the substantial time and entitlement challenges for execution of new projects. Our clients are well positioned to benefit from supply constraints facing increasing copper demand. Clients in this space that we serve include Freeport McMoRan and Asarco.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, these emerging markets collectively represented 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively, of our gross contract revenue.
 Consistent with the overall U.S. and global economies, each of our markets was initially affected adversely in its own way during the early stage  of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our services in all of our markets were considered essential allowing us to continue working uninterrupted. With the passage of time, our markets have steadily rebounded to at or near pre-pandemic levels of activity. 
 Growth Strategies 
 We intend to focus our efforts on the goal of becoming an ENR Top 50 firm within five years of the completion of our initial public offering. We have a long-standing history of robust organic growth rates that are in the upper quartile of industry benchmarks. Our four-fold growth of revenue over the past ten years is comprised of acquisitive growth and organic growth, including significant post-acquisition organic growth in the businesses we have acquired. Two of our universally embraced bedrock cultural values are growth and entrepreneurial spirit. Our commitment to sustaining our unique culture as we continue to expand has been and will continue to be fundamental to maintaining an engaged workforce and driving organic growth throughout our organization.
 As a public company, we intend to embark upon a path of substantially more robust growth than we have experienced to date, primarily through a program of accelerated acquisitive growth. The current outlook is positive for each of the markets we work in, and we intend to grow aggressively and opportunistically in each of them. To achieve the aggressive growth targets we have established, we plan to focus effort and resources to markets and opportunities with the following characteristics: 
  
• | High potential for reoccurring revenue and multi-year assignments
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing renewable energy, energy transition and energy efficiency activities
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Infrastructure in need of upgrade and replacement
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding economic vitality and population
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Geographic and market diversity
--+--------------------------------


• | Complex regulatory requirements
--+--------------------------------

 These characteristics of market opportunities are fluid and we may adapt them from time to time to evolving dynamics. We intend to be opportunistic, responsive to evolving macro-economic trends, and evaluate attractive and synergistic opportunities in other markets when they present themselves.
 In addition to market expansion, we intend to grow by adding skillsets, service lines and geographic footprints which deepen our market penetration and provide enhanced revenue capture opportunities with our existing and prospective customers. Such strategic and synergistic service line extensions include, but are not limited to, program management, energy management and data management and analytics.
 We have built a scalable organizational infrastructure that can accommodate significant growth without a proportionate increase in expense. We have invested time and resources in developing our accounting and financial systems, our management reporting processes, human capital development programs and our information technology infrastructure. As we grow the size and scale of the company, we expect to leverage our investments and general overhead over a larger labor pool, thereby expanding operating margins.

Organic Growth 
 We engage all our managers in our commitment to responsible growth by encouraging responsible freedom, entrepreneurial spirit, innovative thinking, and collaborative business development. Our leaders and managers are personally invested in our success through equity participation and incentives that are targeted to reward organic growth and successful execution. As a public company, we intend to use our publicly traded equity to enhance this compensation strategy. Creative use of growth connected equity incentives along with a commitment to maintaining our core culture are key to the entrepreneurial spirit that will drive our growth. 
 Acquisitive Growth
We are actively engaged in discussions with prospective acquisition targets. We plan for acquisitive growth to be the principal way we achieve our goal of becoming an ENR Top 50 firm within five years of having become a publicly traded company. We have developed a robust network of third-party representatives working on our behalf to identify future acquisition targets that meet our strategic objectives. We maintain a dynamic pipeline driven by general market awareness of our demand for acquisition, existing relationships we have cultivated, and deliberately directed activity of our representatives. We believe that our proven track record and unyielding commitment to preserving our uniquely entrepreneurial culture as we continue to grow will provide us a competitive edge with acquisition targets as a desirable transaction partner. We intend to impose stringent criteria to the evaluation of targets including:

• | Advances of one or more of our strategic growth objectives
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Although we intend to apply rigorous financial discipline in the execution of our acquisition program, purchase price will not always be the primary deal determinant. We evaluate targets holistically, considering all the factors mentioned above. 
 Geographic Expansion 
 We intend to continue a program of robust geographic expansion. Over the foreseeable future, we plan our geographic footprint to be generally limited to the continental United States. While acquisition will generally be the source of new geographies, we may also establish presence in new geographies by opening new offices. To maintain consistency with our acquisition program, we intend to establish a dynamic list of target metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) that will serve as focus areas for expansion. General criteria for our target expansion MSAs include: 

• | Population scale of one million or greater
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Highly ranked in the Urban Land Institute’s publication Emerging Trends in Real Estate
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Location in Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Sunbelt, Southwest, or Mountain West
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability of high caliber, skilled labor force
--+--------------------------------------------------

 We expect our geographic expansion decision making to be fluid, flexible, opportunistic, and loosely bound by the criteria described above.

Commissioning and Energy Efficiency 
 Commissioning involves ensuring that a new building operates in as energy efficient a manner as the original design intent. Over time, the intended use and operation of a building can change significantly. The retro-commissioning process assures that a building and its systems are optimized to perform interactively to minimize energy demands. In addition to aligning the systems with the current usage, the retro-commissioning process will typically result in substantial reduction of both operating costs and energy consumption. In addition to commissioning, we provide energy related services such as energy modeling, Energy Star certifications, LEED consulting, and energy audits that result in substantial reductions in energy consumption.

Acquisitions 
 Acquisitions are a core component of our growth plans. Since 2010, we have successfully completed over 25 acquisitions of engineering and consulting companies. Over the past 10 years, our acquisitions activities have added numerous capabilities, services, leadership and customers in addition to expanding our operations into Arizona, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, Kentucky, and North Carolina. Many of the senior leaders in our company today come from companies we acquired.
 We target acquisitions that provide strategic service line extensions, have a geographic footprint complementary to our existing operations or client assignments, demonstrate capacity for profitability with strong potential for organic growth, align with our corporate culture and have management we can develop into leadership roles within our operations. We pursue opportunities that we can integrate quickly and efficiently. We do not maintain multiple brands or stand-alone operations post-closing. Our goal is for an acquired company to be fully integrated into our operation within one year of closing. We are cautious about advancing discussions or extending terms until we have ascertained a target is compatible with our culture and thoroughly committed to our strategic direction. We add value to the operations of our acquisitions by providing technical resources and subject matter experts that broaden opportunities with existing customers, technology investment to improve utilization, information systems to support productivity, professional development programs to promote staff engagement, supportive growth-oriented leadership and corporate services that improve client focus and leverage overhead through scale.
 We are regularly engaged in discussions with acquisition prospects. These discussions range in formality from an initial inquiry to a non-binding letter of intent.

We have paid a total of approximately $29.1 million for the closed transactions including 250,665 shares of common stock valued at a total of $4.6 million or an average of $18.35 per share. The remaining consideration was comprised of a combination of cash and seller notes.
 Key Customers and Projects 
 We currently serve a diverse portfolio of over 3,000 public and private customers, who own, construct, and maintain the built environment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 65% of our customers engaged us for multiple assignments over the last three years. Our breadth of our customer base diversifies risk, with the ten largest customers we served accounting for approximately 27% and 34% of our net service billing during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We avoid concentration of exposure with no single client accounting for more than 9.0% of our gross revenue during each of these periods. We focus our business development efforts on increasing the proportion of our revenue generated by long-term projects and multi-year contracts. Approximately 25% and 22%, respectively, of our gross revenues were derived under multi-year contracts, which we consider to be reoccurring revenue assignments, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. While we anticipate public sector customers will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our revenues for the near future, we intend to continue expanding long-term relationships and multi-year assignments with private sector customers through organic growth and acquisitions. 
Contracts 
 We enter into contracts that contain two principal types of pricing provisions: (1) lump sum (purely fixed price tasks or a combination of fixed price and hourly tasks) and (2) time and materials (hourly). For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived over 95% and 60%, respectively, of our revenue from lump sum assignments and approximately 5% and 40%, respectively, from hourly assignments. In many cases, a contract will involve multiple tasks, some of which we classify as hourly and some as lump sum. The characteristics of the two contract and task types are as follows:
 Hourly contracts, also referred to as time and material contracts, are common for professional and technical consulting assignments both short term and multi-year in duration. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined maximum fee and we generally experience no risk associated with cost overruns. For hourly contracts, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our customers based upon the actual hours expended toward a deliverable. Direct project expenditures generally pass through to the customer for reimbursement. These contracts may have not-to-exceed parameters requiring us to receive additional authorizations from our customer to continue working but in these cases, we have no obligation to deliver a pre-negotiated result without authorization to continue at additional cost to the customer. Hourly contracts do not include lump sum components as outlined below.
 Lump sum contracts also referred to as fixed fee contracts typically require the performance of some or all obligations under the contract for a specified lump-sum fixed fee, subject to price adjustments if the scope of the project changes or unforeseen requirements arise. Our fixed fee contracts generally include a specified scope of work and defined deliverables. Lump sum contracts can involve both hourly and fixed fee tasks. We classify the contract as fixed fee if any portion of the performance obligation under the contract 
 
15

requires us to complete work outlined in the contract for a pre-determined fixed price. In lump sum contracts, modified schedules and expansions of scope will likely result in additional fees through change orders issued by our customers. 
 Backlog 
 We calculate the value of our undelivered gross revenue to measure backlog and predict future revenue. Backlog includes fully awarded and contracted work along with revenue we expect to realize over time for renewable long term and multi-year assignments. To calculate backlog, we assess the gross contract revenue we will recognize in connection with the completion of undelivered near-term and long-term customer commitments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our gross backlog was comprised as follows: 

 | December 31, 2021 | | | December 31, 2020
--------------------------+-------------------+------+---+------------------
Building Infrastructure 1 | | 62.3 | % | | 42.7 | %
Transportation | | 19.0 | % | | 28.0 | %
Power & Utilities | | 16.2 | % | | 24.8 | %
Other Emerging Markets | | 2.5 | % | | 4.5 | %

 
We use backlog to determine appropriate staffing levels and predict company revenue growth, both of which typically move accordingly with changes in backlog. Backlog definitions and methods of calculation vary within our industry. As such, backlog is not a reliable metric on which to evaluate us relative to our peers.
 As of December 31, 2021 we had approximately $167 million of gross backlog, representing a 47.8% increase as compared to $113 million as of December 31, 2020. We have experienced growth in our backlog as we have expanded our footprint, increased our client base, and more deeply penetrated our end markets. Despite the general economic and personal effects of COVID-19 on our customers, our markets and our employees, we produced growth in our backlog by virtue of our efforts to secure new commitments that exceeded the reductions that result from gross revenue and cancellations. We believe that our growth in backlog is an indicator of the success of our growth strategies. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had net backlog of approximately $145 million representing 86.5% of gross backlog. Net backlog is our gross backlog exclusive of subconsultant costs and other direct expenses. Our net backlog at December 31, 2021 was comprised as follows:
  
 | December 31, 2021 | 
---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----
Building Infrastructure 1 | | 65.9 | %
Transportation | | 12.0 | %
Power & Utilities | | 19.2 | %
Other Emerging Markets | | 2.9 | %

Marketing and Sales 
 We strive to position ourselves as a preferred provider of services to those who own, construct and maintain the built environment. We obtain client engagements primarily through business development efforts, cross selling our services to existing customers, expanding client relationships and referrals. We maintain a professional business development staff that works closely with our managers and leadership to develop strategic, targeted programs for developing new opportunities and securing new assignments. 
 Our business development efforts emphasize lead generation, industry group networking, project and staff promotion and general corporate visibility. We support our managers’ business development efforts with a seasoned team of marketing professionals embedded throughout our organization. We complement our marketing and business development efforts with extensive social media awareness. In addition, we contract for services with a professional public and media relations agency. We are neither engaged in, nor dependent on, traditional paid media advertising. As our service offerings continue expanding, we anticipate increasing our cross-selling opportunities.
 Consumers of engineering and technical services consistent with ours can be local, regional, and national organizations with projects ranging from a single, quick-turn deliverable to complex long-term assignments and multi-year contracts. By focusing our business development efforts more on long-term assignments and multi-year contract opportunities in growing end markets, we extend the visibility of future revenue forecasts and reduce the costs and uncertainty associated with backlog and revenue replacement. We expect to continue to see organic growth in sales based on our commitment to delivering the highest quality and most creatively conceived results to our customers.

Competition 
 Our competition varies according to the market, geographical area of the project and the nature and scope of a particular opportunity. The engineering and consulting industry is highly fragmented and characterized by many small and mid-sized companies that focus their operations on regional markets or specialized service niches. On any given opportunity, we compete and/or team with local, regional and national companies.
 Industry participants compete on the strength of client relationships, reputation for quality of service and reliability, expertise in local markets, technical capabilities, and price. While price differentiation remains an important element in competitive bidding and is often the most significant factor in securing public sector contracts, we believe that value and quality are competitive differentiators that positively affect our ability to win work. The importance of the foregoing factors varies widely based upon the nature, location, and size of the project. On highly complex and sought-after projects, our breadth of services and geographic reach afford us flexibility in pricing and cost estimation. Our ability to provide comprehensive and integrated solutions gives us flexibility when it comes to pricing strategies to meet client budgets and funding limitations. We believe that we benefit from our diversified service offerings and highly skilled, diverse and qualified employees.
 Credentials, licensing and securing professional liability insurance present significant barriers to entry in the industry. Within the engineering market, scale and breadth of service offerings can also act as a barrier for entry for companies that do not have adequate professional and financial resources to compete for and execute complex, large-scale projects. Customers are increasingly emphasizing safe work practices by placing a premium on limiting liability, thus creating an additional barrier to entry for those who cannot demonstrate and maintain a safety record at or above industry standards.
 It is common for many of the companies we compete with to have greater financial resources, larger national platforms or greater service offerings than we currently have. Factors affecting our ability to win assignments include our marketing effectiveness, our client relationships, our ability to team with larger organizations, our capacity to accurately estimate costs and quantify the quality assurance requirements of the work, our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel and our ability to obtain adequate professional insurance for the work perform. We believe our positioning enables us to continue winning incrementally larger work assignments that will grow our business. 
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,000 employees, approximately 92% of which are full-time employees and approximately 89% of which represent our technical staff. Our total employee attrition rate for 2021 among all staff, part-time and full-time, office and field, was approximately 23% overall. Our reputation, aided by our dedicated internal recruiting staff, has afforded us the ability to be successful in locating and engaging with qualified and credentialed employees as needed. We do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel. We consider our employee relations to be exceptional and our level of engagement with employees to be high. Consequently, our rate of professional turnover is below industry averages. As of December 31, 2021, our licensed professional staff represented more than 23% of our 1,000 employees.
 Approximately 30% of our workforce works outdoors performing geomatics engineering, construction management, land procurement and field surveying. Our professional safety team administers a disciplined compliance routine with complex and comprehensive protocols that lead to fewer accidents, lower costs associated with accidents, lost productivity, and insurance. We have earned a safety record that distinguishes us relative to our competitors.
 It is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent to continue to maintain our reputation for delivering high-quality services. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Bowman a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. 
 Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. We have focused our recent efforts in four areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire diverse talent; advocating and facilitating affinity group engagement; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. 
 Health, Safety and Wellness. Fundamental to the success of our business is our commitment to the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. Accordingly, we dedicate resources to making sure our employees are trained and equipped to carry out their job functions to keep themselves, our customers, and the communities in which we work safe. We provide employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including: 1) benefits that provide protection and security so employees have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact financial well-being; 2) support for physical and mental health through tools, resources and leave policies that help improve or maintain health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and 3) choices where possible, so employees can customize benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented adaptive policies that we 
 
17

determined were in the best interest of our employees, the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having most of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. 
 Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leading engineering services provider. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide geographic flexibility, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented “industry-leading” methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent. 
 Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, to build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops throughout the company that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and leadership development programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We offer employees a breadth of on-line tools that provide quick access to learning resources that personalized to the individual’s development objectives. 
 Regulation 
 While our business is not subject to significant regulation, the services we provide to our customers address various federal, state and local regulations that must be complied with to receive approval to proceed. With respect to the operation of our business, we are subject to professional licensing requirements that vary by state.
 Each state establishes licensing and organizational requirements for our services. Certain states allow only individuals and individually owned professional services corporations to hold licenses. In those states there may be grandfathering exemptions that allow corporations to hold licenses. In the event a state does not allow a corporation to hold a license, we have in the past formed professional services corporations owned by Mr. Bowman and other employees to facilitate our ability to work in such states. To the extent we cannot adequately satisfy a state’s licensing requirements, we do not operate in that state. As of December 31, 2021, we were licensed to operate in 45 states.
 We must comply with laws and regulations relating to government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. In connection with the process of bidding for and being awarded certain government assignments we are required to provide an annual Federal Acquisition Regulation rate audit that determines our overhead reimbursement allowance. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include: 
  
• | federal, state, and local laws and regulations (including the Federal Acquisition Regulation or “FAR”) regarding the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding procurement integrity including gratuity, bribery and anti-corruption requirements as well as limitations on political contributions and lobbying.

 Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination, damage to our reputation, price or fee reductions, suspension, or debarment from contracting with the government, each of which could have a materially adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, federal, state, and local government entities may revise existing contract rules and regulations or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time and may also face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and number of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are subject to recompete. 
 We must comply with several laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials. CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party. Other principal federal environmental, health, and safety laws affecting us include, among others, the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. Our business operations may also be subject to similar state and international laws relating to environmental protection. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities. Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability.
