ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc. (“AWH,” “Ascend,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a vertically integrated multi-state cannabis operator focused on operating in adult-use or near-term adult-use states in primarily limited license markets. Ascend’s core business is the cultivation, manufacturing and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which are sold through company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. The Company is a reporting issuer in the United States. The Company’s shares of Class A common stock are listed in Canada on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “AAWH.U.” and in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market (the “OTCQX”) under the symbol “AAWH.” Ascend is an emerging growth company under federal securities laws and as such Ascend is able to elect to follow scaled disclosure requirements for this filing. 
The Company was founded in 2018 with initial operations in Illinois and has since expanded its operational footprint, primarily through acquisitions, and now has operations or financial interests in five U.S. geographic markets: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio. As of December 31, 2021, Ascend has 20 open dispensaries, 18 of which are in states which have passed legislation permitting recreational cannabis. Ascend also operates cultivation facilities in five states with 176,000 square feet of canopy. The Company has a pipeline with fully-financed expansion plans to achieve 24 open dispensaries and 255,000 square feet of canopy generating 127,500 pounds of cannabis annually post build-out, which it hopes to complete by the end of 2022. 
Ascend believes in bettering lives through cannabis. The mission is to improve the lives of its employees, patients, customers and the communities they serve through the use of the cannabis plant. As of March 1, 2022, AWH employed approximately 1,500 people across the cultivation, processing, retail, and corporate functions. 
The following organizational chart describes our current organizational structure. See Exhibit 21.1 to this filing for a list of AWH’s subsidiaries. All lines represent 100% ownership of outstanding securities of the applicable subsidiary unless otherwise noted. In part, the complexity of the organization structure is due to state licensing requirements that mandate that the Company maintain the corporate identity of the operating license holders.

History of the Company
Founding and Incorporation
The Company was originally formed on May 15, 2018 as Ascend Group Partners, LLC, and changed its name to “Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC” on September 10, 2018. On April 22, 2021, Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to “Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc.” and effected a 2-for-1 reverse stock split, which is retrospectively presented for all periods in this filing and referred to as the “Conversion.” As a result of the Conversion, the members of Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC became holders of shares of stock of Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc. 
Following the Conversion, the Company has authorized 750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, 100,000 shares of Class B common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except for voting and conversion rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 1,000 votes per share and is convertible at any time into one share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder. 
Initial Public Offering 
On May 4, 2021, the Company completed an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) of its Class A common stock, in which it issued and sold 10.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $8.00 per share. On May 7, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and we issued and sold an additional 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock. AWH received total net proceeds of approximately $86.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and certain other direct offering expenses paid by the Company. In connection with the IPO, the historical common units, Series Seed Preferred Units, Series Seed+ Preferred Units, and Real Estate Preferred Units then-outstanding automatically converted into a total of 113.3 million shares of Class A common stock and 65 thousand historical common units were allocated as shares of Class B common stock. Additionally, 3.4 million shares of Class A common stock were issued for a beneficial conversion feature associated with the conversion of certain historical preferred units and the Company’s convertible notes, plus accrued interest, converted into 37.4 million shares of Class A common stock. The Company’s shares of Class A common stock are listed on the CSE under the ticker symbol “AAWH.U” and are quoted on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol “AAWH.” 
Outstanding Securities
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 181.0 million fully diluted shares outstanding, including approximately 171.5 million shares of Class A common stock, approximately 0.1 million shares of Class B common stock, approximately 8.0 million total unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, and approximately 1.4 million warrants outstanding, which are in the money and calculated using the treasury stock method based on the closing stock price of the shares of Class A common stock on the CSE on December 31, 2021 of $6.61 per share.
Financing History
Historically, Ascend has used private financing as a source of liquidity for its short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes. During the first quarter of 2021, Ascend raised $49.5 million through the issuance of convertible notes to further finance its expanded operations and acquisitions. Subsequent to the IPO, the Company entered into a new credit facility in August 2021, which provides for a $210.0 million term loan that bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum, due quarterly. Proceeds from the term loan were used, in part, to prepay approximately $75.6 million of existing debt and the remainder will be used to finance future growth initiatives and acquisitions. 
To date, the Company has funded many of its expansion projects via sale leaseback transactions. The significant sale leaseback financings are further described below:
•In August 2018, AWH acquired the real property where its Athol, Massachusetts cultivation facility is located. In April 2020, AWH executed a sale leaseback agreement with Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (“IIP”) with a sale price of $26.8 million and a tenant improvement allowance (“TIA”) of $22.2 million to fund the expansion of the cultivation facility.
•In December 2018, AWH acquired the real property where its Barry, Illinois cultivation facility is located and simultaneously executed a sale leaseback agreement with IIP with a sale price of $19.0 million and an in initial TIA of $6.0 million. The TIA has subsequently increased to $52.0 million as we have expanded the cultivation facility, including the addition of a greenhouse.
•In June 2019, AWH acquired the real property where its Lansing, Michigan cultivation facility is located. In July 2019, AWH executed a sale leaseback agreement with IIP with a sale price of $4.8 million and a TIA of $15.0 million to fund the expansion of the facility.
•In January 2022, AWH acquired the real property where the Franklin, New Jersey cultivation facility is located. In February 2022, AWH executed a sale leaseback agreement with IIP with a sale price of $35.4 million and a TIA of $4.6 million to fund the expansion of the facility. 
Acquisitions
The Company has grown rapidly by strategically acquiring licenses and operations. Ascend’s core acquisition philosophy has been to acquire assets in: marquee locations, limited-license states, and recreational or near-recreational markets.

Description of the Business
Overview of the Company
Ascend is a vertically integrated multi-state cannabis operator focused on adult-use or near-term adult-use cannabis states in limited license markets. The core business is the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which Ascend sells through company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. Ascend believes in bettering lives through cannabis. The mission is to improve the lives of its employees, patients, customers and the communities we serve through the use of the cannabis plant. 
The consumer products portfolio is generated primarily from plant material that the Company grows and processes. As of December 31, 2021, AWH produces consumer-packaged goods in five manufacturing facilities with 176,000 square feet of cumulative canopy and total capacity of 88,000 pounds annually. Ascend is currently undergoing expansions to 255,000 square feet of cumulative canopy, which it hopes to complete by the end of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the product portfolio consists of 224 SKUs, across a range of cannabis product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vapes, edibles and other cannabis-related products. All of the expansion plans are subject to capital allocation decisions, the evolving regulatory environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Product Offering
Ascend produces and distributes cannabis products for its wholesale partners and AWH owned retail stores. Ascend’s goal is to provide wholesale partners and retail customers with consistent access to quality cannabis products while maintaining a variety of form-factors and SKUs. Ascend currently produces its full product set with multiple form factors in Illinois where it has a lab and kitchen. Ascend is in the process of building labs and kitchens at many of its other cultivation facilities so it can produce other form factors such as edibles, in addition to flower and pre-rolls, in all of the states in which it operates. Ascend’s in-house brands offer a variety of options to satisfy every potential customer’s budget and preference. Ascend’s approach to branding is to have brands that fit the “good”, “better”, and “best” consumer categories. The in-house brands include: SimplyHerb, Ozone, and Ozone Reserve. SimplyHerb is the “good” brand and the most price accessible product with SKUs targeted for the price conscious, value-driven buyer. SimplyHerb is currently produced in Illinois, Massachusetts, and Michigan. Ozone is the “better” brand aimed at providing quality products to the seasoned connoisseur as well as the canna-curious. Ozone Reserve is the “best” offering with premier products including exotic flower, refined concentrates, purified oils, as well as resins and distillates. Ozone and Ozone Reserve are currently produced and sold in Illinois, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio. Ozone products have been well received in the market. Ozone has been cited as having the second highest sales of any branded product in Illinois for 2021. 
In addition to producing its own brands, AWH also partners with multiple premiere brands for which it cultivates and sells products targeted to different demographics. Among our partners are Lowell Farms, Flower by Edie Parker, and 1906. This model allows AWH to target customer demographics that complement its base-markets and leverage brand recognition of our partners, while crafting and selling their tried-and-true products. For example:
•Lowell Smokes, by Lowell Farms, allows AWH to leverage the Lowell Farms brand amongst the male demographic seeking premium pre-rolls. 
•Edie Parker, is a Women-led fashion and lifestyle company that launched a cannabis brand, “Flower by Edie Parker.” The Flower by Edie Parker line provides AWH with a product aimed to attract the female consumer. 
•1906, is a brand targeted to consumers looking for premier edible experiences. 1906 gives AWH the ability to provide a competitive edible offering. 
The Company is pursuing a longer term goal to have 50% of sales derived from the wholesale business and 50% of sales derived from the retail business, with 50% of products sold in Ascend retail dispensaries being in-house or partner branded products. With this strategy, AWH expects to benefit from vertical margins, while maintaining an offering with options and variety for its retail consumers. No customer represented more than 10% of the Company’s net revenue during 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Strategy
AWH is committed to running the business aligned with its core strategic principles. These include a focus on:
•Achieving vertical integration and scale in limited-license markets. The Company is committed to being vertically integrated in every state in which it operates. This entails controlling the entire supply chain from seed to sale. AWH is currently vertically integrated in all five states of operation. Four of the five markets in which AWH operates, are in states that pose restrictions limiting the number of licenses allowable, creating a more competitive dynamic. AWH is committed to being a top player in each of the states in which it operates. AWH does not intend to expanded to new states without obtaining a large presence and proposes to expand to a new state if it has plans to expand operations to meet the states maximum allowable number of dispensaries and cultivation footprint. 
•Key flagship locations. AWH is dedicated to securing retail sites in key flagship locations. AWH believes that location is critical when it comes to the success and long-term sustainability of a dispensary. By situating the stores in marquee locations, AWH believes the barriers to entry for competition are higher. Some of AWH’s flagship locations include: 1) Ascend Collinsville, which is strategically located in the retail corridor near St. Louis, 2) Ascend Boston, which is located in downtown Boston between TD Garden and Faneuil Hall, and 3) Ascend Rochelle Park, which is located on Route 17 just a mile from the Garden State Plaza in highly trafficked northern New Jersey.
•Disciplined capital allocation and execution of mergers and acquisitions. AWH has a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The Company only deploys capital in markets and on projects which it believes will be accretive to its shareholders. To date, the bulk of the Company’s expansion has been through acquisition. The Company views M&A as the fastest path to growth given the barriers to entry and the regulatory environment in the cannabis industry. Largely due to early license awards, there are a number of independent and single-state operators in the markets in which we operate today. These assets represent attractive acquisition opportunities, as the Company can leverage its local permitting expertise and operational and financial resources to optimize the performance of these assets. Most of the Company’s acquisitions have been negotiated and priced prior to the respective state’s passing of recreational legislation. Many of the assets AWH has acquired have historically underperformed under their previous 
ownership and AWH has been able to improve the financial performance of acquired assets by implementing its standard operating procedures and technology, thereby allowing for AWH to make acquisitions that create significant value for shareholders. 
The Company has been successful in opening facilities and dispensaries and expects continued growth to be driven by opening new operational facilities and dispensaries under our current licenses, expansion of our current facilities, and increased consumer demand. 
General Development of the Business
As of December 31, 2021, AWH has direct or indirect operations or financial interests in five U.S. geographic markets: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio. AWH has expanded its operational footprint primarily through several acquisitions as identified above. See acquisition history in “History of the Company.” 
In addition to the acquisitions the Company has made, AWH has benefited from several cultivation expansion opportunities. The material cultivation expansion projects that have been completed or are underway are detailed below:
•Illinois. In 2019, AWH added a lab and kitchen and scaled the Illinois Cultivation it had acquired through the original acquisition of Revolution Cannabis-Barry LLC in 2018. In 2020, AWH commenced a large construction project to add a 125,000 square foot greenhouse with 58,000 square feet of canopy to its Barry, IL cultivation center. Prior to expansion, the facility had 55,000 square feet of indoor canopy and a lab and kitchen. The greenhouse was largely completed in December 2021 and the Company planted the first 3,600 plants in the greenhouse the first week of 2022. Now, AWH has scaled Illinois cultivation operations to 113,000 total square feet of canopy. 
•Massachusetts. The Company acquired real property of its Athol cultivation site in 2018. In 2019, the Company began Phase 1 of its cultivation build in Athol, MA and commenced cultivation activities in 2020. By Q2 2021, the Company had completed 17,000 square feet of canopy at the site, concluding Phase 1. The Company recently added an incremental 37,000 square feet of canopy and is in the process of adding a lab and kitchen.
•New Jersey. In early 2021, AWH commenced Phase 1 of expansion of the Franklin, NJ cultivation center it had acquired through Greenleaf Compassion Center, LLC. By Q3 2021 the Company had 16,000 square feet of canopy online. The Company plans to add an additional 26,000 square feet of canopy and a lab and kitchen to the current site by the end of 2022. In November 2021, AWH acquired the land adjacent to the Franklin, New Jersey cultivation site. Between the two sites, the Company plans to add an incremental 108,000 square feet of canopy by the end of 2023, for a total of 150,000 square feet. 
•Michigan. In 2021, AWH phased in 28,000 feet of canopy at the Lansing, MI location. The Company plans to add a lab to the facility in 2022 so it can expand the offering in the state by producing additional form factors such as edibles. 
Operations Summary
AWH’s core business is the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which are sold through company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. The Company is committed to being vertically integrated in every state in which it operates, which entails controlling the entire supply chain from seed to sale. AWH has been successful in opening facilities and dispensaries, and expects the majority of future growth to be driven by opening new operational facilities and dispensaries under current licenses, expansion of current facilities and increased consumer demand.
Cultivation
AWH’s cultivation practices have been engineered for scalability and repeatability as the Company expands into additional states. AWH aims to continuously refine cultivation operations to rapidly scale output without sacrificing quality and consistency. Future expansion is planned to provide the infrastructure to diversify the seed supply and further mechanize and automate harvest operations. AWH believes it will be able to continue to rapidly scale cultivation by: (i) commencing operations at additional cultivation sites; (ii) expanding canopy at existing cultivation sites; and (iii) increasing yields by dialing in genetics and environmental conditions and increasing the number of harvests. AWH is focused on driving biomass cost per gram lower with the goal of creating a competitive advantage in the limited license states in which the Company operates. AWH has used strain rationalization, improved cultivation practices, and investments in technology to drive higher yields per square foot than the industry average. 
Manufacturing
AWH’s manufacturing operations are centered around the quality of products and the efficiency of production. AWH strives to produce high quality, consistent products across its manufacturing facilities, and has implemented strict brand and quality assurance standards and standard operating procedures in an effort to ensure consistent product and consumer experience across all operating markets. AWH is focused on scaling capacity, improving yields, and increasing efficiency. AWH is standardizing and increasing capacity in hydrocarbon and ethanol extraction wherever possible with the goal of maximizing product quality and throughput and improve crude yields and are making investments in manufacturing and extraction technology, including high speed flower packaging, cartridge filling and automated pre-rolling as drivers of labor efficiency.
Wholesale distribution 
During the fourth quarter of 2021, approximately 33% of AWH sales were generated by sales of Ascend products to third-party retailers. AWH aims to grow the wholesale business to half of the total business by: 1) increasing wholesale market share and expanding penetration within wholesale distribution, 2) selling higher volumes of product to wholesale customers, and 3) expanding the category set to higher value products sold to wholesale customers. As of December 31, 2021, AWH sold products to 99% of the dispensaries in Illinois, but the Company has room to significantly increase market penetration across its other states. AWH has internal sales managers dedicated to these penetration efforts. 
AWH is also acutely focused on category management and expansion. AWH’s development efforts are focused on pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, and other ready-to-use product forms that it expects to outperform whole flower over time. The Company is also concentrating on expanding the vape offering, including live products and ratio products that represent fast growing segments of the vape category, and expanding the pre-roll offering. The Company expects the pre-roll category to grow significantly as the preferred way to consume flower for many customers. In 2021, AWH launched a pre-roll partnership with Lowell Smokes and in 2022, the Company plans to launch multiple additional pre-roll SKUs in smaller sizes, innovative multi-pack options, and premium infused pre-rolls. AWH is also expanding the edibles manufacturing capabilities to provide micro-dose product forms along with additional forms desired by the market. Strategic partnerships are a key part of diversifying and expanding the Company’s offering. 
Retail
AWH operates both licensed retail adult-use and medicinal cannabis dispensaries. The Ascend retail brand aims to elevate the cannabis shopping experience by combining consistent and convenient customer service with high-quality products and exclusive brand partnerships. AWH believes the retail operating principles described below differentiate the Company from its competitors. 
•Location. All of the Company’s dispensaries are located in key retail locations. AWH believes location is a huge barrier to entry for defending its competitive positioning overtime. Each of the Company’s dispensaries are located within a turn off of a major highway or in a highly trafficked downtown. 
•Vision. Ascend believes in using the power of the cannabis plant to help people better their lives. As a company, AWH has a strong commitment to the success of the brand and maintaining this vision.
•People and Culture. AWH aims to hire store managers with prior experience in cannabis and has an acute focus on talent development for the rest of the store employees. The Company has an extensive onboarding and training program focused not only on brand and product knowledge, but also on creating a great customer experience. AWH employees are motivated by daily sales goals set at the stores. AWH reaches these goals by ensuring it has the right product and the right talent in place to deliver a best-in-class customer experience. Stores measure week over week sales growth, peak days for volume, transactions, gross margin and other key performance metrics.
•High Volume Focus. AWH is focused on driving high transaction volume in its retail stores. The Company improves traffic with increased number of point of sales systems, optimized store layouts, and enhanced menu management. 
•Omni-channel experiences. As customer shopping preferences continue to evolve and customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, AWH strives to create a best-in-class, omni-channel customer experience. These experiences have been especially critical to operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Omnichannel experiences include: 
◦Reserve-Online-Pickup-in-Store. This allows customers to purchase merchandise through letsascend.com and pick-up the merchandise in-store, which often drives incremental in-store sales. Over 90% of customers in Collinsville utilize the Reserve-Online-Pickup-in-Store option.
◦Delivery. In Q4 2021, AWH launched pilot delivery programs in Newton, Massachusetts, and throughout Michigan, allowing AWH to bring customers the products they enjoy straight to the comfort of their homes. 
◦Curbside Pickup. This offering allows customers to have their orders brought directly to their vehicles.
◦Online Consultations and Real-time Chat. This allows customers to interact with associates, ask questions and build their basket ahead of their in-store visit, driving associate productivity and incremental sales.
Strategic Sourcing
Ascend continues to focus on supply chain optimization and strategic sourcing as the Company scales, allowing our growing base to provide leverage across the organization. This includes a focus on supplier rationalization, so that best-in-class supply partners are providing full end-to-end service across the enterprise. Building a common base of operating procedures, packaging and supply components, and supply partners across the organization is critical to this strategic direction.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives are at the core of AWH’s guiding principles. AWH is committed to creating an inclusive, sustainable company that provides best-in-class governance. Below are a few of the key ESG initiatives at Ascend. 
•Social Justice. While AWH understands and appreciates how fortunate the Company is to be in a position to help build and guide the future of modern cannabis, AWH is also acutely aware of the lives that have been destroyed, especially in minority communities, through decades of unjust laws and inequitable enforcement. AWH has been a long standing partner with the Last Prisoner Project (LPP) to support their effort to push to get non-violent offenders released from prison. In 2021, AWH on-boarded a Vice President of Social Justice who is leading the charge for AWH’s internal social justice initiatives. Under this leadership, AWH has contributed funds to the Continuing Legal Education (CLE) institute which seeks to educate attorneys interested in learning the ins and outs of the expungement process. AWH will continue to look for other opportunities to collaborate with nonprofits and legal organizations to sponsor and coordinate expungement clinics. In January 2022, AWH launched a nonprofit foundation incubating and supporting individuals who qualify as social equity applicants.
•Diversity and Inclusion. People are the Company’s greatest asset. The team is comprised of a consortium of skilled and passionate professionals and partners from a diverse range of fields. AWH believes in building a diverse team, creating a space where ALL feel welcome and have the opportunity to grow while contributing to the success of AWH. AWH recently launched three Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) for the LGBTQ+, Black, and Female communities within AWH. These are voluntary, employee-led groups that foster a diverse, inclusive workplace aligned with organizational mission, values, goals, business practices, and objectives. 
•Environmental. AWH recently commenced the process to gather baseline energy and water usage metrics. In January 2022, AWH began planting in its first greenhouse at our Barry, Illinois cultivation location. Greenhouses consume less energy than indoor grows because they subsidize their energy needs with the sun. Quality is still maintained as conditions are maintained with HVAC systems and supplemental light is available. AWH will continue to explore other operational solutions to lower its environmental impact.
•Governance. Best-in-class governance and disclosure are important to AWH. The Company has a majority independent board, provides GAAP financials, and publishes its key governance policies, as well as provides access to its whistleblower hotline on its investor website. The Company monitors disclosures relative to its peers to help maintain best-in-class practices. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,500 employees, approximately 89% of whom were in field operations and approximately 11% of whom were in corporate administrative and management. We offer our employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers and provide them with a wide array of company paid benefits and compensation packages which we believe are competitive relative to our peers in the industry. As of December 31, 2021, 26% of leadership positions were held by ethnic minorities and 37% of leadership positions were held by females. AWH will continue to work towards achieving a more equitable balance of genders and ethnicities across the company and in leadership. 
Employee safety and health in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. 
The Company’s number and levels of employees are continually aligned with the pace and growth of our business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate the business successfully. 
Operations by State
The following is an overview of our cultivation and dispensary assets by state that are currently operational, as well as our expected asset base once fully built out.
Cultivation assets:
Across its cultivation assets, as of December 31, 2021 AWH had 176,000 square feet of total canopy, which is defined as the square footage of flower, vegetation, and propagation tables. AWH anticipates expanding to 255,000 square feet of total canopy by the end of 2022. The Company estimates each square foot of total canopy has the power to generate approximately half a pound of cannabis per year. All of the Company’s cultivation and planned cultivation facilities are indoor, with the exception of the 55,000 square foot greenhouse in Illinois. The Company believes that indoor grow facilities allow for fine-tuned controls which help enable AWH to grow high-quality cannabis. All of the cultivation projects underway are expansion projects to existing cultivation facilities. The Company deems these as lower risk than green fielding at new sites that are not yet permitted for cultivation operations. The new cultivation plans are flexible and will ultimately depend on market conditions, local licensing, construction, and other regulatory permissions.

Competitive Conditions 
Competition
The Company primarily competes with:
•Multi-State Operators (“MSOs”). AWH competes with MSOs from a retail and wholesale perspective, including Trulieve Cannabis Corp., Cresco Labs Inc., Green Thumb Industries Inc., Curaleaf Holdings Inc., TerrAscend Corp., Columbia Care Inc,, and Ayr Wellness Inc, among others. The specific competitors vary for each state of AWH’s operations. For example, Cresco is AWH’s primary wholesale competitor in Illinois, but not as big of a wholesale competitor in New Jersey. 
•Single State Operators (“SSOs”). AWH competes with many single state operators across its portfolio. 
•Consumer Packaged Goods Companies (“CPG Companies”). Although not a competitive threat today, AWH anticipates CPG Companies gaining a larger presence in the industry if and when cannabis is rendered federally legal. 
•Pharmaceutical Companies. Although not a competitive threat today, AWH anticipates pharmaceutical companies gaining a larger presence in the industry if and when cannabis is rendered federally legal. 
The Company believes it is well-poised in its competitive positioning due to the competitive advantages highlighted below: 
•Scale and vertical integration. The Company’s scale helps it compete, particularly, against the SSOs who may not be able to obtain the same operating synergies that AWH can. AWH is vertically integrated in each of its states of operation and only operates in states where it can have where it believes it can be a top 5 player one day. 
•Access to capital. The Company’s access to capital helps it compete, particularly, against the SSOs who may not have the resources that AWH does. AWH management has also been able to leverage its extensive capital markets knowledge, securing $210.0 million in senior debt with an interest rate of 9.5% per annum, which at the time of the deal was an industry leading cost of capital. 
•States of operation. With the exception of Michigan, all of AWH’s states of operation are limited license. 
•Management. AWH has a diverse management team with experience spanning capital markets, cannabis industry, regulatory, and operations. The management team has proven it can lead, by becoming a top 3 operator in the state of Illinois. 
•Location and second mover advantage. While many competitors who were early entrants to the space were pushed into industrial parks or off the beaten path, AWH locations can often be found on the corner of Main & Main, surrounded by other top tier businesses such as Trader Joe’s & Starbucks. This is because AWH entered the business slightly later than some of its peers. In doing so, the Company strategically acquired locations, rather than pursuing a lottery strategy to obtain licenses. AWH was able to use its ‘second-mover advantage’ to secure highly desirable retail locations, many of which it considers to be flagship stores. 
•Differentiated portfolio of brands. AWH provides a robust offering and a wide range of branded products spanning every price point with products targeted to every demographic. 
Overview of Government Regulation
On February 8, 2018, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised their previously released Staff Notice 51-532 – Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (“Staff Notice 51-532”), which provides specific disclosure expectations for issuers that currently have, or are in the process of developing, cannabis related activities in the United States as permitted within a particular State’s regulatory framework. In accordance with the Staff Notice 51-532, below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. Our subsidiaries and licensed operators with which we have contractual relationships are directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, or distribution of cannabis in the adult-use and/or medical cannabis marketplace in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio. In accordance with Staff Notice 51-532, we evaluate, monitor, and reassess this disclosure, and any related risks, on an ongoing basis and the same will be supplemented and amended to investors in public filings, including in the event of government policy changes or the introduction of new or amended guidance, laws, or regulations regarding cannabis regulation. We intend to promptly remedy any material known occurrences of non-compliance with applicable state and local cannabis rules and regulations, and intend to publicly disclose any material non-compliance, citations, or notices of violation which may have an impact on our licenses, business activities, or operations.
The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. The CSA explicitly prohibits the manufacturing, distribution, selling and possession of cannabis and cannabis-derived products as a consequence of its Schedule I classification. Classification of substances under the CSA is determined jointly by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) and the FDA. The United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I drugs and substances as drugs with no currently accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. However, the FDA has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of cannabidiol (“CBD”), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the cannabis plant, for the treatment of seizures associated with two epilepsy conditions. The FDA has not approved cannabis or cannabis compounds as a safe and effective drug for any other condition. Moreover, under the 2018 Farm Bill or Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, CBD remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, with a narrow exception for CBD derived from hemp with a tetrahydrocannabinol, which is commonly referred to as tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), concentration of less than 0.3%. 
Unlike in Canada, where federal legislation uniformly governs the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of medical and adult-use cannabis under the Cannabis Act, S.C. 2018, c. 16, and the Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. To date, there are 37 states, plus the District of Columbia (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands), that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. In addition, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the District of Columbia, and 18 states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult-use. Eleven states have also enacted low-THC/high-CBD only laws for medical cannabis patients.
State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult-use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use, distribution and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under any and all circumstances under the CSA. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution establishes that the United States Constitution and federal laws made pursuant to it are paramount and in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law shall apply. Although the Company’s activities are compliant with applicable United States 
state and local law, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.
The Obama administration attempted to address the inconsistent treatment of cannabis under state and federal law in the Cole Memorandum which outlined certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical or adult-use purposes. The Cole Memorandum noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memorandum’s enforcement priorities. The DOJ did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the DOJ should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors.
On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memorandum, which rescinded the Cole Memorandum effective upon its issuance. The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects “Congress’ determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime,” and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress by following well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. We are not aware of any prosecutions of investment companies doing routine business with licensed cannabis related businesses in light of the new DOJ position. However, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities, despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and thus it is uncertain how active U.S. federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities.
The former Attorneys General who succeeded former Attorney General Sessions following his resignation did not provide a clear policy directive for the United States as it pertains to state-legal cannabis related activities. President Joseph R. Biden was sworn in as the 46th United States President on January 20, 2021. President Biden nominated Merrick Garland to serve as Attorney General in his administration. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, confirmed on March 10, 2021, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive cannabis enforcement policy. At Mr. Garland’s confirmation hearing, he stated, “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” He has not, however, reissued the Cole Memorandum or otherwise provided guidance. If the Department of Justice policy under Attorney General Garland were to aggressively pursue financiers or owners of cannabis-related businesses, and United States Attorneys followed such Department of Justice policies through pursuing prosecutions, then the Company could face (i) seizure of its cash and other assets used to support or derived from its cannabis operations, (ii) the arrest of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors, and charges of ancillary criminal violations of the Controlled Substances Act for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the Controlled Substances Act by virtue of providing financial support to cannabis companies that service or provide goods to state-licensed or permitted cultivators, processors, distributors, and/or retailers of cannabis, and/or (iii) the barring of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors who are not United States citizens from entry into the United States for life. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis.
While federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memorandum’s priorities as an enforcement guide, the prosecutorial effects resulting from the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and the implementation of the Sessions Memorandum remain uncertain. The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation may create unwanted political backlash for the DOJ. It is also possible that the revocation of the Cole Memorandum could motivate Congress to reconcile federal and state laws. While Congress is considering and has considered legislation that may address these issues, there can be no assurance that such legislation passes. Regardless, at this time, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. It is unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered.
Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Canadian banks are likewise hesitant to deal with cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework of the industry. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. While Congress is considering legislation that may address these issues, there can be no assurance of the content of any proposed legislation or that such legislation is ever passed.
Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum and states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories - cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminated - based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. On the same day that the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the “2014 Cole Memorandum”) directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The 2014 Cole Memorandum has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes against state-compliant actors was not a DOJ priority.
However, former Attorney General Sessions’ revocation of the Cole Memorandum and the 2014 Cole Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 Cole Memorandum and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum is a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. However, in the United States, it is difficult for cannabis-based businesses to open and maintain a bank account with any bank or other financial institution. 
One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill, remains in place following the rescission of the Cole Memorandum. For fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, Congress has included a rider to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (currently referred to as the “Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 signed into legislation by President Trump in December 2020 that remained in effect until September 30, 2021. On September 30, 2021 and December 3, 2021, President Biden signed short-term continuing resolutions to extend current appropriations, most recently through February 18, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the 
House passed a third continuing resolution to extend current appropriations through March 11, 2022, but the Senate has not yet acted on the measure. There is no guarantee that the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment will be included in the omnibus appropriations package or a continuing budget resolution once the current Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 expires.
Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the DOJ appears to continue to adhere to the enforcement priorities set forth in the Cole Memorandum. The Cole Memorandum and the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment gave licensed cannabis operators (particularly medical cannabis operators) and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding the DOJ’s enforcement priorities and the risk of operating cannabis businesses. While the Sessions Memorandum has introduced some uncertainty regarding federal enforcement, the cannabis industry continues to experience growth in legal medical and adult-use markets across the United States. Accordingly, as an industry best practice, we continue to employ the following policies to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
•ensure that its operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
•ensure that its cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements);
•implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors;
•implement policies and procedures in place to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels;
•implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or cross any state lines in general;
•ensure that its state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, and is not engaged in any other illegal activity, or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and
•ensure that its products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
On June 7, 2018, the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (the “STATES Act”) was introduced in the Senate by Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A companion bill was introduced in the House by Democratic representative Jared Polis of Colorado. The bill provides in relevant part that the provisions of the CSA, as applied to cannabis, “shall not apply to any person acting in compliance with state law relating to the manufacture, production, possession, distribution, dispensation, administration, or delivery of marijuana.” Even though cannabis will remain within Schedule I of the CSA under the STATES Act, the bill makes the CSA unenforceable to the extent it conflicts with state law. In essence, the bill extends the limitations afforded by the protection within the federal budget-which prevents the DOJ and the DEA from using funds to enforce federal law against state-legal medical cannabis commercial activity-to both medical and adult-use cannabis activity in all states where it has been legalized. The STATES Act was reintroduced on April 4, 2019 in both the House and the Senate. Since the STATES Act is currently draft legislation, there is no guarantee that the STATES Act will become law in its current form.
On December 4, 2020, the House of Representatives passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019 (the “MORE Act”). The MORE Act would provide for the removal of cannabis from the list of controlled substances in the CSA and other federal legislation. It would end the applicability of Section 280E to cannabis businesses but would impose a 5% federal excise tax. The MORE Act was not passed by the Senate prior to the end of the 116th Congress, but an updated version was subsequently reintroduced in the House of Representatives on May 28, 2021. On September 30, 2021, the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance the MORE Act once again in a first step towards passage in the full Hose. Before it could become law, the MORE Act would need to be passed by the House of Representatives and Senate and then signed into law by the president. There is no guarantee the MORE Act will become law in its current form. 
H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would expand financial services in the United States to cannabis-related legitimate businesses and service providers, was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 7, 2019 with bipartisan support. On April 11, 2019, S. 1200, the Senate version of the SAFE Banking Act, was filed. This bill also has bipartisan support and more than a fifth of the total Senate, 27 members, co-sponsored it. On September 25, 2019, H.R. 1595 passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 321 to 103, but it stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on May 15, 2020, when it was included in the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act. However, that measure also stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on April 19, 2021 as H.R. 1996, by a vote of 321 – 101. On September 23, 2021, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) that contained the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act was subsequently removed from the NDAA by the House-Senate conference committee on December 7, 2021, and was not included in the final version of the NDAA. On February 4, 2022, the House approved The America COMPETES Act of 2022, which includes the provisions of the Safe Banking Act. The America COMPETES Act now advances to the Senate for consideration. There is no guarantee the SAFE Banking Act will become law in its current form, if at all. 
Compliance with Applicable State Laws in the United States
We are in compliance with applicable cannabis licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each state in which we currently operate. We have in place a detailed compliance program and an internal legal and compliance department, and we are building out our operational compliance team across all states in which we operate. Our compliance department is overseen by our chief compliance officer and further consists of compliance professionals who oversee and ensure compliance in each of our jurisdictions and facilities. We also have external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in every jurisdiction in which we operate.
We provide training for all employees, using various methods on the following topics relevant to job tasks: compliance with state laws and rules; patient education materials; education materials for recreational customers; security in our facilities and establishments; handwashing and sanitation practices; packaging procedures; state mandated tracking software; establishment specific tracking; track and trace; inventory and POS software; audit procedures; epidemic responses; emergency situation response; dispensing procedures; patient/client check-in procedure; employee education and consultation materials; packaging and labeling requirements; cannabis waste and destruction; active shooter response; robbery response; fire response; bomb-threat response; sexual harassment; drug free workplace; internet and phone usage; discrimination harassment; workplace violence; hygiene and clothing requirements; hand washing; medical emergency response; biocontamination response; gas leak response; visitor access; discounts for special groups; customer loyalty programs; client intake; storage and recall of products; the science of cannabis; speaking with physicians; edibles education; reconciling transactions; inventory control; receiving inventory; shipping inventory; corrective and preventive action plans; filing corrective and preventive action reports; pesticides; wastewater; irrigation systems; fertilizer; beneficial organisms; climate control; transplanting; inventory tagging; pruning; defoliation; drying, trimming and curing; storage of products; maintaining confidentiality; cash handling; and preventing diversion of products.
We emphasize security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory, from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access our computerized inventory control system.
We monitor all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market and timely resolve any issues identified. We keep records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors, as well as how and when an issue was resolved. Moreover, we monitor news sources for information regarding developments at the state and federal level relating to the regulation and criminalization of cannabis.
Further, we have created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory. We also have comprehensive standard operating procedures in place for performing inventory reconciliation, and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. We maintain accurate records of our inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to our standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that our operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. We ensure adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensures that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly.
We maintain strict compliance guidelines with respect to online reservations of products. No purchase and sale transactions may be completed online. A patient, patient’s primary caregiver or customer may reserve products online, but the patient or customer must be physically present at one of our dispensaries to complete the transaction. This requirement allows our dispensary staff to ensure that our standard operating procedures (including its compliance programs) are applied to all patients, patient’s primary caregivers and customers in connection with the purchase and sale of products.
In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the patient or the patient’s primary caregiver at the applicable dispensary, dispensary staff must verify the patient’s or the patient’s primary caregiver’s identity and credentials (such as a state-issued medical cannabis card) and confirm the patient’s allotment amount to ensure the user is not exceeding the state’s dispensing limits. Once the foregoing is verified, the patient or the patient’s primary caregiver may pay for the products to complete the purchase. If the customer does not have valid identification and credentials, the customer will not be able to purchase medical cannabis at the applicable dispensary, irrespective of any reservations made online.
In jurisdictions where recreational cannabis is legal, upon arrival at the dispensary, a customer must present government-issued photo identification to verify they are at least 21 years of age. Once the identification is verified, the customer may pay for the products to complete the transaction. If the customer does not have valid identification, the customer will not be able to purchase recreational cannabis at the applicable Company dispensary, irrespective of any reservations made online.
We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in full compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” there are significant risks associated with our business.
State Regulation of Cannabis 
The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with our business are described in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” 
Following the thesis that distributing brands at scale will win, we enter markets where we believe that we can profitably and sustainably operate and command significant market share, and thus maximize consumer and brand awareness. The regulatory frameworks enacted by the states, which are similar to the limited and controlled issuance of gaming or alcohol distributorship licenses, provide macro-level indication of whether certain state markets will be sustainable and profitable.
Below is a summary overview of the regulatory and competitive frameworks in each of our operating markets. 
Illinois
Illinois Regulatory Landscape
In January 2014, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with certain debilitating or “qualified” medical conditions to access medical cannabis, became effective. There are over 35 qualifying conditions as part of the medical program, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program that allows individuals who have/could receive a prescription for opioids to access medical cannabis. 
On August 28, 2018, Public Act 100-1114, the Alternative to Opioids Act of 2018, was signed into law, making changes to the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act. The Public Act created the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program (“OAPP”), which allows access to medical cannabis for individuals who have or could receive a prescription for opioids as certified by a physician licensed in Illinois.
On August 12, 2019 Governor J.B. Pritzker signed into law legislation that made the program permanent and added 11 conditions to the existing program. 
In June 2019, Illinois legalized adult-use cannabis pursuant to the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (the “IL Act”). Effective January 1, 2020, Illinois residents 21 years of age and older may possess up to 30 grams of cannabis (non-residents may possess up to 15 grams). The IL Act authorizes the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the “IDFPR”) to issue up to 75 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses before May 1, 2020 and an additional 110 conditional licenses during 2021. No person may hold a financial interest in more than 10 dispensing organizations. Existing medical dispensaries were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization License” to serve adult purchasers at an existing medical dispensary or at a secondary site. The IDFPR also held an application period for Conditional Adult Use Cannabis Dispensary Licenses from December 10, 2019 through January 2, 2020. On September 3, 2021, the IDFPR announced the results of the lotteries to award 185 conditional adult use dispensing licenses. However, as a result of a series of lawsuits, those licenses have not yet been formally awarded. Further, the IDFPR announced its intention to conduct an additional lottery to award conditional adult use dispensing organization licenses and resolve the pending litigation. As of January 2022, there were approximately 110 licensed dispensaries in Illinois.
The Illinois Department of Agriculture (the “IL Ag. Department”) is authorized to make up to 30 cultivation center licenses available for medical and adult-use programs. As with existing medical dispensaries, existing cultivation centers were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Center License.” The IL Act requires the IL Ag. Department of Agriculture to issue up to 60 craft grower licenses by December 21, 2021, and states the IL Ag. Department may also issue up to 60 infuser licenses by the same date. On August 2, 2021, the IL Ag. Department announced that it had issued 32 initial craft grow licenses, 28 infuser licenses, and 9 transporter licenses. No person can hold a financial interest in more than three cultivation centers, and the centers are limited to 210,000 square feet of canopy space. Cultivation centers are also prohibited from discriminating in price when selling to dispensaries, craft growers, or infuser organizations. License awards will likely be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and legal actions taken by applicants. 
The IL Act imposes several operational requirements on adult-use licensees and requires prospective licensees to demonstrate their plans to comply with such requirements. For example, applicants for dispensary licenses must include an employee training plan, a security plan, recordkeeping and inventory plans, a quality control plan and an operating plan. 
Licensees must establish methods for identifying, recording, and reporting diversion, theft, or loss, correcting inventory errors, and complying with product recalls. Licensees also must comply with detailed inventory, storage, and security requirements. Cultivation licenses are subject to similar operational requirements, such as complying with detailed security and storage requirements, and must also establish plans to address energy, water, and waste-management needs. Dispensary licenses will be renewed bi-annually, and cultivation licenses, craft grower licenses, infuser organization licenses, and transporter licenses will be renewed annually. 
Illinois Licenses
Illinois licenses four types of cannabis businesses within the state: (1) cultivation; (2) processing; (3) transportation; and (4) dispensary. All cultivation, craft growers, infusers, and transporting establishments must register with the Illinois Department of Agriculture. All dispensaries must register with the IDFPR. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a cannabis establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to strict annual renewal requirements.
HealthCentral LLC has been issued a total of six dispensary licenses, two medical licenses and four adult use licenses. Revolution Cannabis-Barry LLC has been issued two cultivation licenses, one medical license and one adult use license. MOCA LLC is licensed to operate two dispensaries and has been issued a total of three dispensary licenses, one medical and two adult use licenses. Chicago Alternative Health Center, LLC is licensed and operates two dispensaries, one in Chicago and one in Chicago Ridge.

Illinois Storage and Security
Both our cultivation center and our dispensaries are required to store cannabis in restricted-access areas. Our dispensaries must store inventory on-site in a secured and restricted-access area and enter information into Illinois’ tracking system as required by law and IDFPR rules. Any cannabis or cannabis products in an open or defective package, which have expired, or which the company otherwise has reason to believe have been opened or tampered with must be segregated in secure storage until promptly and properly disposed of. 
Dispensaries are also required to implement security measures designed to deter and prevent unauthorized entry into the facility (and restricted-access areas) and theft, loss or diversion of cannabis or cannabis products. In this respect, dispensaries must maintain a commercial grade alarm and surveillance system installed by an Illinois licensed private alarm contractor or private alarm contractor agency. Dispensaries must also implement various security measures designed to protect the premises, customers and dispensing organization agents (employees). 
Illinois Reporting Requirements
Illinois uses BioTrack THC as its track and trace (“T&T”) system. All dispensing organization licensees are required to use a real-time, web-based inventory tracking/point-of-sale system that is accessible to IDFPR at any time, and at a minimum, tracks the date of sale, amount, price, and currency. We use BioTrack THC for inventory management and LeafLogix as a point-of-sale system. Licensees are also required to track each sales transaction at the time of the sale, daily beginning and ending inventory, acquisitions (including information about the supplier and the product) and disposal.
Illinois Transportation Requirements
Currently, licensed cultivation centers may transport cannabis and cannabis products in accordance with certain guidelines. For receiving products, dispensing organizations must receive a copy of the shipping manifest prepared by the cultivation center in advance of transport and is required to check the product delivered against such manifest at the time of delivery. All cannabis and cannabis products must be packaged in properly labeled and sealed containers. Dispensaries may not accept products that are mislabeled, products that have labels missing or when packaging is opened or tampered with.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Illinois
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Illinois. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.”
Massachusetts
Massachusetts Regulatory Landscape
The Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program (the “MA Program”) was formed pursuant to the Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana (the “MA ACT”). The MA Program allows registered persons to purchase medical cannabis and applies to any patient, personal caregiver, Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (each, a “MTC”), and MTC agent that qualifies and registers under the MA Program. To qualify, patients must suffer from a debilitating condition as defined by the MA Program. Currently there are eight conditions that allow a patient to acquire cannabis in Massachusetts, including AIDS/HIV, ALS, cancer and Crohn’s disease. As of May 31, 2019, approximately 59,000 patients have been registered to purchase medical cannabis products in Massachusetts. The MA Program is administrated by the Cannabis Control Commission of Massachusetts (the “CCC”). As of February 1, 2022, there were approximately 193 open dispensaries in Massachusetts.
In November 2016, Massachusetts voted affirmatively on a ballot petition to legalize and regulate cannabis for adult-use. The Massachusetts legislature amended the law on December 28, 2016, delaying the date adult-use cannabis sales would begin by six months. The delay allowed the legislature to clarify how municipal land-use regulations would treat the cultivation of cannabis and authorized a study of related issues. After further debate, the state House of Representatives and state Senate approved H.3818 which became Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017, An Act to Ensure Safe Access to Marijuana, and established the CCC. The CCC consists of five commissioners and regulates both the Adult Use and Medical Use of Marijuana programs. Sales of adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts started in July 2018. Adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts is regulated under M.G.L. ch. 94G and 935 CMR 500 et seq.
Under the MA Program, MTCs are heavily regulated. Vertically integrated MTCs grow, process, and dispense their own cannabis. As such, each MTC is required to have a retail facility as well as cultivation and processing operations, although retail operations may be separate from grow and cultivation operations. An MTC’s cultivation location may be in a different municipality or county than its retail facility.
The MA Program mandates a comprehensive application process for MTCs. Each Registered Marijuana Dispensary (each, a “RMD”) applicant must submit a Certificate of Good Standing, comprehensive financial statements, a character competency assessment, and employment and education histories of the senior partners and individuals responsible for the day-to-day security and operation of the MTC. Municipalities may individually determine what local permits or licenses are required if an MTC wishes to establish an operation within its boundaries.
Massachusetts Licenses
MassGrow LLC has been issued one cultivation and one provisional manufacturing processing license and Ascend Mass LLC has been issued one retail license and two provisional retail licenses. 
The below table lists our Massachusetts licenses:

Entity | License Number | City | Expiration Date /Renewal Date | Description 
MassGrow, LLC | MC281488 | Athol | 08/12/2022 | Adult Use Cultivation License 
MassGrow, LLC | MP281460 | Athol | 6/23/2022 | Manufacturing Processing Provisional License

Ascend Mass, LLC | MRN283075 | New Bedford | 7/21/2022 | Adult Use Provisional License 

Each Massachusetts dispensary, grower and processor license is valid for one year and must be renewed no later than 60 calendar days prior to expiration. As in other states where cannabis is legal, the CCC can deny licenses and renewals for multiple reasons, including (per 935 CMR 500.400) (1) failure to complete the application process within the required time period; (2) submission of deceptive, misleading, or fraudulent information, (3) an indication of an inability to maintain and operate a compliant cannabis establishment, (4) determination of unsuitability pursuant to, for example, certain criminal convictions, (5) failure to comply with cannabis license control limitations, (6) rejection of revocation of another cannabis license in Massachusetts or elsewhere; or (7) any other ground that serves the purposes of the law. Revocations can also be based on (per 935 CMR 500.450) (1) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction; (2) attempting to assign ownership to another entity or making other significant changes without proper permission, (3) lack of responsible operation of a cannabis establishment, (4) maintaining a substandard level of compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, (5) financial insolvency; (6) failure to cooperate with law enforcement, (7) violation of the safety, health, or welfare of the public; or (8) committing, permitting, aiding, or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of the cannabis establishment. Additionally, license holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the state. 
Regulation of the Adult-Use Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
Adult-use cannabis has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC, a regulatory body created in 2018, licenses adult-use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (collectively, “Marijuana Establishments” or “MEs”) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use cannabis facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018.
Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
Applicants must submit proof of being an entity registered to do business in Massachusetts, as well as a list of all people and entities having direct or indirect control of the business, documentation of any such people or entities’ other business interests, details of the amounts and sources of capital resources, and documentation of a bond or escrow account. Furthermore, the applicant must provide a specific address for the location of the establishment, proof of a property interest in that address, documentation that the applicant has a “host community agreement” with the municipality, and documentation that the applicant has held at least one community outreach meeting. The applicant must also provide a description of plans to ensure that the cannabis establishment will be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, and also a specific plan to positively impact areas of disproportionate impact (geographical locations in the state which have had historically high rates of arrest, conviction, and incarceration related to cannabis crimes). The application also requires payment of a fee. 
All individuals identified as having direct or indirect control in the license must undergo an extensive background check that includes criminal, civil, and regulatory records; certain criminal convictions, civil actions, or regulatory infractions may trigger a finding of unsuitability
Each license applicant must submit detailed information about its business registration, certificates of good standing, and a plan to obtain liability insurance. The application must include a detailed business plan, a detailed summary of operating policies and procedures addressing issues like security, storage, prevention of diversion, transportation, inventory practices, recordkeeping, and a specific diversity plan demonstrating promotion of equity among people of color, women, veterans, persons with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Such plans must have specific goals and measurable outcomes that will be monitored and updated through the entire existence of the cannabis establishment. 
Pursuant to 935 CMR 500.050, no person or entity may own or have direct or indirect control over more than three licenses in each Marijuana Establishment category (i.e., cannabis retailer, cannabis cultivator, cannabis product manufacturer). Additionally, there is a 100,000 square foot cultivation canopy restriction for adult-use licenses.
Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Adult-Use)
Cannabis retailers may purchase, transport, sell, repackage, or otherwise transfer cannabis and cannabis products to consumers. On-site consumption is prohibited. All permitted cannabis-related activities must take place solely at the licensed address. 
All cannabis establishment employees must receive at least eight hours of training annually.

No one under 21 is permitted to purchase cannabis or to be on the premises. Retail stores must ensure that customers purchase no more than one ounce of cannabis (or its equivalent in other forms) per day. Retailers also have the right to refuse sales to customers, for example, those that appear to be impaired by the influence of substances. 
The retail point of sale system must be approved by both the CCC and the state Department of Revenue. It must be integrated with Metrc, the state’s seed-to-sale tracking system. The system must also be audited on a monthly basis to ensure that no additional software has been installed that could alter sales data. 
Cannabis retailers must have available extensive consumer education materials, including in languages other than English. 
Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Adult-Use)

The systems must be angled so as to allow for the capture of clear identification of any person entering or existing the establishment and must be able to remain operational for a minimum of four hours in the event of a power outage. Regular audits are required every 30 days.
Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Adult-Use)
Cannabis products may only be transported between licensed MEs by registered Marijuana Establishment agents. A licensed cannabis transporter may contract with a licensed Marijuana Establishment to transport that licensee’s cannabis products to other licensed establishments. The originating and receiving licensed establishments shall ensure that all transported cannabis products are linked to METRC, Massachusetts’ seed-to-sale tracking program. For the purposes of tracking, seeds and clones will be properly tracked and labeled in a form and manner determined by the CCC.

All areas of a Marijuana Establishment, all Marijuana Establishment agents and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. Marijuana establishments must immediately upon request make available to the CCC all information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, or an investigation of any incident or complaint. A Marijuana Establishment must make all reasonable efforts to facilitate the CCC’s inspection, or investigation of any incident or complaint, including the taking of samples, photographs, video or other recordings by the CCC or its agents, and to facilitate the 
CCC’s interviews of Marijuana Establishment agents. During an inspection, the CCC may direct a Marijuana Establishment to test cannabis for contaminants as specified by the CCC, including but not limited to mold, mildew, heavy metals, plant-growth regulators, and the presence of pesticides not approved for use on cannabis by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.
Moreover, the CCC is authorized to conduct a secret shopper program in retail establishments to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Massachusetts
On July 10, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, issued a statement regarding the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts. Mr. Lelling stated that since he has a constitutional obligation to enforce the laws passed by Congress, he would not immunize the residents of Massachusetts from federal law enforcement. He did state, however, that his office’s resources would be primarily focused on combating the opioid epidemic. He stated that considering those factors and the experiences of other states that have legalized adult-use cannabis, his office’s enforcement efforts would focus on the areas of (i) overproduction, (ii) targeted sales to minors, and (iii) organized crime and interstate transportation of drug proceeds. 
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Massachusetts. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.”
Michigan
Michigan Regulatory Landscape
In 2008, the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative established a medical cannabis program for serious and terminally ill patients. This program, which was approved by the House but not acted upon and defaulted to a public initiative on the November ballot. Proposal 1 was approved by 63% of voters on November 8, 2008. Proposal 1 was then written into law and approved by Michigan’s lawmakers in December 2008. The resulting Act became the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (“MMMA”). The MMMA provides access to state residents to cannabis and cannabis related products under one of 11 debilitating conditions, including epilepsy, cancer, HIV/AIDS, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder. In July 2018, the Medical Marihuana Review Panel approved 11 additional conditions to the list of aliments to qualify for medical cannabis. The additional 11 include chronic pain, colitis and spinal cord injury.
In 2016, the Michigan legislature passed two new acts and also amended the original MMMA. The first act, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (“MMFLA”), effective December 20, 2016 and most recently amended effective December 7, 2021, establishes a licensing and regulation framework for medical cannabis growers, processors, secure transporters, provisioning centers, and safety compliance facilities. The second act, the Marihuana Tracking Act (“MTA”), establishes a “seed-to-sale” system to track cannabis that is grown, processed, transferred, stored, or disposed of under the MMFLA.
In November of 2018 Michigan voters, through another public ballot initiative approved the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (“MRTMA”) legalizing and establishing a licensing and regulatory framework for adult-use growers, processors, secure transporters, retailers, microbusinesses, event organizers, designated consumption establishments, and safety compliance facilities. The proposal was approved by nearly 56% of the voters. The state began taking applications for such on November, 1, 2019 and the first sales of adult-use marihuana took place on December 1, 2019. According to the Cowen report, Charting Cannabis: A U.S. State Level Deep Dive, published February 19, 2020, there were 125 open dispensaries in Michigan as of the end of 2019.
The Marihuana Regulatory Agency (“MRA”) is a separate agency within the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and is responsible for the oversight of cannabis in Michigan. The MRA consists of the Medical and Adult Marihuana Applications, Compliance, Scientific & Legal and Enforcement Divisions and the Michigan Medical Marihuana Program Division. The MRA is responsible for issuing cards to medical cannabis patients, and oversight and licensing of medical facilities and adult-use establishments.
The MRA and State of Michigan attempted to combine the medical and adult-use markets during the 2019-2020 legislative session, but the proposed bill did not receive a vote in both legislative bodies. However, while the MMFLA and MRTMA remain separate and distinct laws, the MRA adopted topic-based Administrative Rules in June 2020 which address both medical facilities and adult-use establishments. 
On September 27, 2021, the MRA held a public hearing to receive comments on updated Administrative Rules that are intended to provide clarity and consistency to licensees in both the medical and adult-use markets. Final drafts of the amended Administrative Rules were published in January 2022. While there is no official date at this time, the updated Administrative Rules are likely to become effective in within a few months. 
Under both the MMFLA and MRTMA Michigan municipalities can choose if they will allow cannabis establishments or facilities, and the type and number of establishments or facilities within their jurisdiction. This includes licensing and zoning ordinances for many municipalities. Because each municipality is able to devise a unique set of rules for cannabis licenses, each facility or establishment in a different Michigan municipality may be subject to a different set of local ordinances.

Michigan Storage and Security Requirements
Michigan licensees must meet the security requirements as set forth in the MRTMA, MMFLA and Administrative Rules. As such, licensees are required to include a security plan in their state license applications. The plan and required security measures include, but are not limited to, ensuring that visitors are escorted by an employee at all times; maintaining commercial locks or electronic access on all doors and windows; having an active alarm system for the premises; having a video surveillance system that records all areas where marihuana products are weighed, packed, stored, loaded, and unloaded for transportation, prepared, or moved; recording the access point to the surveillance system; recording the exterior and interior of entrances and exits; recording all areas within 20 
feet of entrances and exits; recording in 720p resolution or higher; ensuring sufficient lighting for recording; maintaining recordings for at least 30 days and a log of all those with access to the surveillance system. All marihuana products must be stored in a secured limited or restricted access area on the licensed premises. General requirements for all cannabis business can be found in Michigan Administrative Rule 420.206.
Michigan Transportation Requirements
Except in limited circumstances, transportation of cannabis between licensees takes place via State licensed secure transporters. Transported products are entered into a manifest and the Michigan statewide monitoring system. Products are picked up from cultivators and processors by secure transporters and then delivered to destinations. For adult use products licensed transporters may also transfer products between our retail locations. A transporter must transport all cannabis products in a locked, secured, and sealed container that is not accessible while in transit. The container must be secured by a locked closed lid or door. Cannabis product must be labeled and kept in separate compartments or containers within the main locked, secured, and sealed container. If the transporter transports money associated with the purchase or sale of cannabis product between businesses, the transporter shall lock the money in a sealed container kept separate from the cannabis product and only accessible to the licensee and its employees. A transporter cannot maintain custody of the cannabis product for more than 96 hours without permission from the MRA.
Michigan Reporting Requirements
Michigan licensees must maintain on-site, or have electronic access to, all records of the establishment. Records are defined as books, ledgers, documents, writings, photocopies, correspondence, electronic storage media, electronically stored records, money receptacles, equipment in which records are stored, including data or information in the statewide monitoring system, or any other document that is used for recording information. Additionally, licensees must provide the state with an audited annual financial statements every three years, or a shorter period as may be determined by the MRA. This report must be conducted by an independent certified public accountant and includes information including but not limited to: sampling of all transaction done by the organization over the course of the year; employees and employment; bank accounts; management, revenues, METRC transactions, vendors, taxes, ownership and distributions, outsourcing, licensing agreements, and independent contractors. Additionally, licensees must report any change to operations, officers, owners, members, managers, applicants; changes in processing machinery or equipment, violations or local ordinances, changes in named applicant; changes in names; conveyances of interest in a license; modifications to businesses or business plans between inspections or submissions; changes in capacities; changes to ingress or egress; adverse reactions to marihuana products; criminal convictions, charges, civil judgements, lawsuits, legal proceedings, charges, or governmental investigations; employee discipline for misconduct related to product sales or transfers; diversion; theft; and any suspected criminal activity on the premises. The above issues, depending on the type, must be reported either before the change, within 24 hours thereof or within 10 days of notice thereof.
Michigan Site-Visits and Inspections
The MRA or its agents may inspect an licensee at any time without prior notice in order to determine compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All areas of the licensed premises, all licensee employees, agents, and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. Licensees must immediately upon request make available to the MRA all information that may be relevant to a MRA inspection, or an investigation of any incident or complaint. 
MRA agents conduct initial pre-licensure inspections, a post-licensure inspection within 30 days of operation, and then semi-annual inspections thereafter. The Michigan Bureau of Fire Services also conducts fire safety plan reviews, initial pre-licensure and semi-annual inspections of licensees.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Michigan
On November 8, 2018, United States Attorneys Matthew Schneider and Andrew Birge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Michigan, respectively, issued a joint statement regarding the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Michigan. They stated that since they had taken oaths to protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States, they would not immunize the residents of Michigan from federal law enforcement. They stated that they would continue to the investigation and prosecution of cannabis crimes as they do with any other crime. They stated they would consider the federal law enforcement priorities set by the DOJ, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of prosecution, and the cumulative impact of the crime on a community, while also considering their ability to prosecute with limited resources. They stated that combating illegal drugs was just one of many priorities, and that even within the area of drugs, they were focused on combating the opioid epidemic. They stated that they have not focused on prosecution of low-level offenders, which they stated would not change (unless aggravating factors were present). They did state that certain crimes involving cannabis could pose serious risks and harm to a community, including interstate trafficking, involvement of other illegal drugs or activity, persons with criminal records, presence of firearms or violence, criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels, bypassing local laws and regulations, potential for environmental contamination, risks to minors, and cultivation on federal property. On December 21, 2021, Dawn N. Ison was appointed as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. 
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Michigan. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.”
New Jersey
New Jersey Regulatory Landscape
New Jersey’s medical cannabis program was introduced in January 2010 when then Governor Corzine signed the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act into law which legalized medical cannabis for patients with certain enumerated qualifying conditions. Medical cannabis sales began in December 2012 and as of the first quarter of 2021, there were 10 licensed and operational ATCs dispensing medical cannabis to patients. However, the state has accepted applications for satellite dispensaries for those operators, and we expect additional locations to open by the end of calendar year 2021. According to the Cowen report, Charting Cannabis: A U.S. State Level Deep Dive, published February 19, 2020, there were six open medical dispensaries in New Jersey as of the end of 2019.
In March 2018, under the direction of Governor Phil Murphy, who campaigned on a platform that included cannabis legalization, the New Jersey Department of Health (“NJ DOH”) issued the Executive Order 6 Report, which immediately expanded the medical cannabis program in numerous ways including adding chronic pain and anxiety as qualifying conditions, doubling the monthly product limit, and permitting current licensees to open satellite dispensaries. In August 2018, the NJ DOH began accepting applications for the licensing of six additional ATCs, and those licenses were awarded in December 2018. In August 2019, the NJ DOH accepted applications for the licensing of 24 additional ATCs, divvied among three regions (northern, central, southern) and three forms of endorsements (cultivation, dispensary, vertically integrated).
ATC licenses are awarded by a selection committee that evaluates applicants on the following general criteria: (1) submittal of mandatory organizational information; (2) ability to meet the overall health needs of qualified patients and safety of the public; (3) history of compliance with regulations and policies governing government-regulated cannabis programs; (4) ability and experience of applicant in ensuring an adequate supply of cannabis; (5) community support and participation; (6) ability to provide appropriate research data; (7) experience in cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing cannabis in compliance with government-regulated cannabis programs; and (8) workforce and job creation plan. Information required to be submitted is wide-ranging, and includes identification information and background checks of principals, employees, directors, and other stakeholders, and evidence of compliance with certain state and local laws and ordinances.
ATCs are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing security, staffing, point-of-sale systems, manufacturing standards, hours of operation, delivery, advertising and marketing, product labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations (N.J.A.C. 8:64 et seq.) should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area. For example (and not by limitation), ATCs are subject to a number of regulations regarding their policies, procedures, records, and reporting. For example, ATCs must develop oversight procedures; procedures to ensure safe growing and dispensing operations; security policies; inventory 
protocols; disaster plans; pricing standards; and crime prevention plans and must maintain careful records, including organizational charts; facility documents; supply-and-demand projections; general business records; detailed sales records; and detailed personnel and training records. ATCs must provide substantial training for their employees and must maintain an alcohol and drug-free workplace.
Licenses are renewed annually, and applications therefore must be submitted 60-days prior to expiration of the license then in force and effect. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations associated with the license, license holders can expect to receive a renewal in the ordinary course of business.
On November 3, 2020, voters in New Jersey approved an amendment to the state’s constitution to legalize cannabis for adult use in New Jersey. On February 22, 2021, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law three bills which, taken together, give effect to the amendment and decriminalize small amounts of cannabis possession in New Jersey. The cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis for adult use purposes will remain prohibited until the new Cannabis Regulatory Commission establishes the regulatory framework for adult use cannabis.
New Jersey Licenses
Ascend New Jersey, LLC is permitted to open three dispensaries and one cultivation under its ATC license. Ascend New Jersey, LLC is an indirect subsidiary of the Company.
The below table lists our New Jersey licenses:

Entity | License Number | City | Expiration Date / Renewal Date | Description 
Ascend New Jersey, LLC | 9292020 | Franklin | 12/31/2022 | Cultivation License
Ascend New Jersey, LLC | 9292020 | Montclair | 12/31/2022 | Medical License 
Ascend New Jersey, LLC | 9292020 | Rochelle Park | 12/31/2022 | Medical License 

New Jersey Storage and Security Requirements
All ATCs are required to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of cannabis including, when appropriate, systems to protect against electronic records tampering. With respect to security and inventory protocols, ATCs are required to maintain security and alarm systems in good working order; test and inspect such security systems; employ policies to limit unauthorized access to areas containing cannabis; adopt security protocols to protect personnel; minimize exterior access and ensure the exterior of the facility has adequate lighting; and notify the proper authorities of reportable losses, security breaches, alarm activations, and electrical failures.
Further, all ATCs must install, maintain in good working order and operate a safety and security alarm system at its authorized physical address(es) that will provide suitable protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week against theft and diversion and that provides, at a minimum: (i) immediate automatic or electronic notification to alert state or local police agencies to an unauthorized breach of security at the ATC; and (ii) a backup system that activates immediately and automatically upon a loss of electrical support and that immediately issues either automatically or electronic notification to state or local police agencies of the loss of electrical support. ATCs must also implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing cannabis and the theft of cannabis and security measures that protect the premises, registered qualifying patients, registered primary caregivers and principal officers, directors, board members and employees of the ATC. Each ATC must establish a protocol for testing and maintenance of the security alarm system and conduct maintenance inspections and tests of the security alarm system at the ATC's authorized location at intervals not to exceed 30 days from the previous inspection and test, and it must promptly implement all necessary repairs to ensure the proper operation of the alarm system. In the event of a failure of the security alarm system due to a loss of electrical support or mechanical malfunction that is expected to last longer than eight hours, an ATC must notify NJ 
DOH and either provide alternative security measures or close the affected facilities until service is restored. Finally, each ATC must equip its interior and exterior premises with electronic monitoring, video cameras, and panic buttons.
New Jersey Reporting Requirements
The reporting requirements for ATCs are governed by N.J.A.C. 8:64-4.3. The State of New Jersey allows ATCs to choose their method of electronic verification and a T&T system. In the course of operations, ATCs are required to conduct detailed monthly inventories and an annual comprehensive inventory. ATCs must retain records for at least two years.
New Jersey Site-Visits & Inspections
ATCs are subject to inspection by NJ DOH at any time, with or without notice. ATCs must provide immediate access to all facilities, materials, and information requested by NJ DOH. Failure to cooperate with an onsite assessment and or to provide access to the premises or information may be grounds to revoke the permit of the ATC and to refer the matter to state law enforcement agencies. If a problem is discovered, the ATC must notify NJ DOH in writing, with a postmark date that is within 20 business days of the date of the notice of violations, of the corrective actions the ATC has taken to correct the violations and the date of implementation of the corrective actions. Additionally, the NJ DOH is continually monitoring the operations of the ATC through our security and surveillance systems. The NJ DOH has the ability to access our surveillance system at any time and therefore may conduct a visual inspection of the premises at any time.
New Jersey Transportation Requirements
An ATC that is authorized by permit to cultivate medical cannabis at one location and to dispense it at a second location shall transport only usable cannabis from the cultivation site to the dispensing site according to a delivery plan submitted to the NJ DOH. Each vehicle must be staffed with at least two registered ATC employees. At least one delivery team member shall remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains medical cannabis. Each delivery team member shall have access to a secure form of communication with the ATC, such as a cellular telephone, at all times that the vehicle contains medical cannabis. Each delivery team member must possess their ATC employee identification card at all times and shall produce it to NJ DOH staff or law enforcement officials upon demand. 
Each transport vehicle needs to be equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area, which shall be used for the sanitary and secure transport of medical cannabis. Each ATC must maintain current commercial automobile liability insurance on each vehicle used for transport of medical cannabis in the amount of $1 million per incident. Each ATC must ensure that vehicles used to transport medical cannabis bear no markings that would either identify or indicate that the vehicle is used to transport medical cannabis, and each trip must be completed in a timely and efficient manner, without intervening stops or delays. Each ATC shall maintain a record of each transport of medical cannabis in a transport logbook, which must include dates and times of trips, names of employees on the delivery team, relevant facts about the products transported and the signatures of the delivery team. 
ATCs must report any vehicle accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable events that occur during transport to the permitting authority in accordance with New Jersey law.
Home delivery is not permitted under New Jersey law. An ATC may not deliver cannabis to the home or residence of a registered qualifying patient or primary caregiver.
U.S. Attorney Statements in New Jersey
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in New Jersey.

Ohio
Ohio Regulatory Landscape
Effective September 8, 2016, House Bill 523 legalized the use of medical cannabis for 26 debilitating conditions as prescribed by a licensed physician. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program (“OMMCP”) allows people with certain medical conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, HIV/AIDS, ALS, cancer, traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and cachexia, to purchase medical cannabis. Though Ohio was required to implement a fully operational OMMCP by September 8, 2018 with a controlled system for cultivation, laboratory testing, physician/patient registration and dispensing, the timeline was delayed until November 2018. Regulatory oversight is shared between three offices; (a) the Ohio Department of Commerce with respect to overseeing cultivators, processors and testing laboratories; (b) the Ohio Board of Pharmacy with respect to overseeing retail dispensaries and the registration of patients and caregivers, and (c) the State Medical Board of Ohio with respect to certifying physicians to recommend medical cannabis. The OMMCP will permit limited product types including oils, tinctures, plant materials and edibles. Adult-use and the smoking of cannabis flower are prohibited. Adult-use and the smoking of cannabis flower are prohibited. As of January 2022, there were approximately 231,165 registered patients allowed to purchase cannabis products from a dispensary. As of January 2022, there were 57 open dispensaries in Ohio.
Ohio Licenses
To be considered for approval of a provisional dispensary, cultivation or a processing license, the applicant must complete all mandated requirements. To obtain a certificate of operation for a medical cannabis dispensary, cultivation facility or processing facility, the prospective licensee must be capable of operating in accordance with Chapter 3796 of the Revised Code, the Medical Marijuana Control Program. Dispensary certificates of operation carry two-year terms, while certificates of operation for cultivators and processors must be renewed annually. 
A certificate of operation will expire on the date identified on the certificate. A licensee will receive written or electronic notice 90 days before the expiration of its certificate of operation. The licensee must submit the renewal information at least 45 days prior to the date the existing certificate expires. The information required for the license renewal includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) a roster that includes the dispensary’s employees’ names, (b) the history of compliance with regulations, and (c) the number and severity of any violations. If a licensee’s renewal application is not filed prior to the expiration date of the certificate of operation, the certificate of operation will be suspended for a maximum of 30 days. After 30 days, if the dispensary has not successfully renewed the certificate of operation, including the payment of all applicable fees, the certificate of operations will be deemed expired.

New York
New York Regulatory Landscape
In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (the “CCA”) to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical cannabis program. The CCA provides access to the program to certified patients who suffer from one of 14 qualifying serious conditions including, debilitating or life-threatening conditions including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS and chronic pain. Certified patients must also have one of the following associated or complicating conditions: cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain, severe nausea, seizures, or severe or persistent muscle spasms, post-traumatic stress disorder, or opioid use disorder (if enrolled in a treatment program pursuant to Article 32 of the Mental Hygiene Law).
Pursuant to the CCA, only a limited number of product offerings are allowed including metered liquid or oil preparations, solid and semi-solid preparations (e.g. capsules, chewable and effervescent tablets), metered ground plant preparations, and topical forms and transdermal patches. Smoking medical cannabis is not allowed. Medical cannabis may not be incorporated into the food products unless approved by the Commissioner of Health and smoking of cannabis flower is prohibited. According to the Cowen report, Charting Cannabis: A U.S. State Level Deep Dive, published February 19, 2020, there were 35 open dispensaries in New York as of the end of 2019.
On March 31, 2021, New York became the 16th state to legalize the adult-use of cannabis with the enactment of Senate Bill S854A, also known as The Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act (the “MRTA”). Under MRTA, the current medical cannabis program is set to undergo several changes. A new Office of Cannabis Management-an independent agency operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authority-will be responsible for regulating the adult-use cannabis market as well as the existing medical cannabis and hemp programs, and will be overseen by a new five-member Cannabis Control Board. The list of medical conditions covered under the CCA will be widened to include additional qualifying conditions, medical patients will no longer be restricted from smoking medical cannabis, and the current limit on cannabis supply for medical patients will be doubled. Medical cannabis license holders may also be allowed to double their existing number of dispensaries for up to a total of eight dispensaries, but no more than three of the dispensary locations will be permitted to serve as adult-use cannabis retail stores. The legislation takes effect immediately, though full implementation will not occur until the 
Cannabis Control Board develops regulations for the adult-use cannabis program. It is currently expected that full implementation could take between 18 months to two years. On January 24, 2022, the Office of Cannabis Management announced the launch of a new Medical Cannabis Program certification and registration system expanding the existing medical cannabis program. Moving forward, the program will allow the certification of a patient by a practitioner for any condition that the practitioner believes can be treated with medical cannabis.
New York Licenses
The New York Department of Health (“NYDOH”) approves entities to operate as “registered organizations” under the CCA. There are currently ten registered organizations. Each registered organization is vertically integrated and can operate one cultivation/processing facility and up to four dispensaries.
On February 25, 2021, we entered into the Investment Agreement among the Company, AWH New York, LLC, MM Enterprises USA, LLC (“MM USA”) and MedMen NY, Inc. (“MMNY”), under which we would have, subject to regulatory approval, completed an investment of approximately $73.0 million in MMNY, a registered organization in New York. MM USA and MMNY are subsidiaries of MedMen Enterprises, Inc. (“MedMen”). MMNY holds a cultivation and four dispensary licenses. To the Company’s knowledge, MMNY’s business is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted in the State of New York and the Company is not aware of any non-compliance, citations or notices of violation that may have an impact on MMNY’s license, business activities or operations.
Refer to “Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Legal Matters–MedMen NY Litigation,” for a discussion of the current status of the MMNY transaction and litigation.
The below table lists the New York licenses held by MMNY: 

Entity | License Number | City | Expiration Date / Renewal Date | Description 
MedMen NY, Inc. | MM0506D | Williamsville | 07/31/2023 | Dispensary 
MedMen NY, Inc. | MM0502D | Lake Success | 07/31/2023 | Dispensary

MedMen NY, Inc. | MM0504D | Syracuse | 07/31/2023 | Dispensary 
MedMen NY, Inc. | MM0501M | Utica | 07/31/2023 | Manufacturing

Licenses under New York’s medical cannabis program are valid for two years from the date of issuance and registered organizations are required to submit a renewal application not more than six months nor less than four months prior to expiration. Registered organizations must ensure that no medical cannabis product is sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of New York. 
New York Record-Keeping/Reporting
The NYDOH uses the BioTrack THC T&T system to track medical cannabis activity. Each month, each registered organization is required to file reports with the NYDOH which provides information showing all medical cannabis products dispensed during the month. All other data shall be pulled from the T&T system. The data must include (a) documentation, including lot numbers where applicable, of all materials used in the manufacturing of the approved medical cannabis product to allow tracking of the materials including but not limited to soil, soil amendment, nutrients, hydroponic materials, fertilizers, growth promoters, pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides, (b) cultivation, manufacturing, packaging and labeling production records, and (c) laboratory testing results. The records are required to be maintained for a period of five years.

U.S. Attorney Statements in New York
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in New York.

Certain Recent Developments 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (the “Pandemic”) and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. COVID-19, and its variants, continues to spread throughout the U.S. and other countries around the world, and the duration and severity of its effects is currently unknown. We continue to implement and evaluate actions to strengthen our financial position and support the continuity of our business and operations in the face of this Pandemic and other events. While the Pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations to date, the ultimate severity of the Pandemic and its impact on the economic environment is uncertain. The uncertain nature of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally may impact our business operations for reasons including the potential quarantine of our employees, customers, and third-party service providers, delay in supply chains, and the inability to adequately adjust business operations and staffing per evolving regulations and Center for Disease Control guidelines that inhibit business operations and productivity and thereby potentially impact revenue, revenue growth, and profitability. Further, unemployment levels nationally may result in less consumer spending on our products. Given these uncertainties, we are unable to estimate the future impact of the Pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows in future periods. We believe we have sufficient liquidity available from cash and cash equivalents on hand of $155.5 million as of December 31, 2021 to enable us to meet our working capital and other operating requirements, fund growth initiatives and capital expenditures, settle our liabilities, and repay scheduled interest payments on debt. Refer to “Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for additional information. 
In January 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Chicago Alternative Health Center, LLC and Chicago Alternative Health Center Holdings, LLC (together, “Midway”), a medical and adult use dispensary operator in the Chicago, Illinois area, in accordance with a purchase agreement entered into on December 15, 2020. Midway is consolidated as a variable interest entity from the signing date through the final close date in January 2022.
In February 2022, the Company sold and subsequently leased back one of its capital assets in Franklin, NJ for total proceeds of $35.4 million, excluding transaction costs.
