Our end-to-end platform of high-capacity Ka-band satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband solutions to enterprises, consumers, military and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. In addition, our government business includes a market-leading portfolio of military tactical data link systems, satellite communication products and services, and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. We believe that our diversification strategy—anchored in a broad portfolio of products and services—our vertical integration approach and our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial applications and segments as well as across different geographic markets, provide us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies. We conduct our business through three segments: satellite services, commercial networks and government systems.
Inmarsat Acquisition
On November 8, 2021, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) to combine with Connect Topco Limited, a private company limited by shares and incorporated in Guernsey (Inmarsat), with the shareholders of Inmarsat and certain management and employees who hold options and shares of a subsidiary of Inmarsat whose options and shares will be exchanged for shares of Inmarsat prior to closing (collectively, the Sellers). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we will purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Inmarsat from the Sellers upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the Inmarsat Transaction). The total consideration payable by us under the Purchase Agreement consists of $850.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments (such as the dividend paid by Inmarsat in April 2022, see below), and approximately 46.36 million unregistered shares of our common stock. On April 6, 2022, Inmarsat paid a dividend of $299.3 million to the Sellers, resulting in a $299.3 million reduction in the cash consideration payable by us at the closing of the Inmarsat Transaction. Our board of directors has unanimously approved the Purchase Agreement and the proposed Inmarsat Transaction.
 The closing of the Inmarsat Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals and clearances, and approval by our stockholders of the issuance of shares in the Inmarsat Transaction and an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance. The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and certain of the Sellers and further provides that, upon termination of the Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee of up to $200.0 million or to reimburse certain out-of-pocket expenses of certain Sellers up to $40.0 million.
 We have obtained financing commitments for an additional $1.6 billion of new debt facilities in connection with the Inmarsat Transaction (which may be secured and/or unsecured), which amount excludes the commitments that were obtained with respect to the $700.0 million term loan facility that we entered into on March 4, 2022 to fund our standalone growth expenditures (the Term Loan Facility). In light of the $299.3 million reduction in the cash purchase price payable in the Inmarsat Transaction, we currently expect to incur $1.3 billion of additional indebtedness under these commitments. However, the total amount of indebtedness incurred under these commitments may change, including in the event that available cash from other sources is higher than expected. We also plan to assume $2.1 billion in principal amount of Inmarsat senior secured bonds and the outstanding indebtedness under Inmarsat’s $2.4 billion senior secured credit
facilities. In addition, we obtained commitments of $3.2 billion to backstop certain amendments required under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) and our direct loan facility with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Ex-Im Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities) and Inmarsat’s $2.4 billion senior secured credit facilities, which amendments had been obtained under the Revolving Credit Facility and Inmarsat’s $2.4 billion senior secured credit facilities as of the date of this report.
 Other Acquisitions
On April 30, 2021, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in EBI, a satellite broadband internet service provider in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), from Eutelsat. We paid approximately $167.0 million in cash, net of what is currently estimated to be an immaterial amount of estimated purchase price consideration (net of approximately $121.7 million of EBI’s cash on hand, resulting in a cash outlay of approximately $51.0 million).
 On April 30, 2021, we completed our acquisition of RigNet, a leading provider of ultra-secure, intelligent networking solutions and specialized applications. In connection with the acquisition, we issued approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock to RigNet former shareholders, paid down $107.3 million of outstanding borrowings of RigNet’s revolving credit facility, and retained approximately $20.6 million of RigNet’s cash on hand.
 The assets and results of operations of EBI and RigNet are primarily included in our satellite services segment, with insignificant amounts included in our commercial networks segment.
 
Segments
 Satellite Services
Our satellite services segment uses our proprietary technology platform to provide satellite-based high-speed broadband services around the globe for use in commercial applications.
 Our proprietary Ka-band satellites are at the core of our technology platform, and we also have access to a number of Ka-band and Ku-band satellites in service globally. We own four Ka-band satellites in service — three over North America (our second-generation ViaSat-2 satellite (launched in 2017), our first-generation ViaSat-1 satellite (launched in 2011) and the WildBlue-1 satellite (launched in 2007)), and the KA-SAT satellite (launched in 2010) over EMEA. In addition, we have lifetime leases of Ka-band capacity on two satellites. We are also planning to launch a global constellation of three third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites currently under construction. We expect our ViaSat-3 constellation, once in service, to provide approximately eight times the capacity of the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites combined and to enable us to deliver affordable connectivity across most of the world.
The primary services offered by our satellite services segment are comprised of:
•Fixed Broadband Services, which provide consumers and businesses with high-speed, high-quality broadband internet access and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, primarily in the United States as well as in various countries in Europe and Latin America. Our service offerings include premium data plans with download speeds of up to 100 Mbps in select areas in the United States. We also offer wholesale and retail fixed broadband services to our distribution partners. 
 •In-Flight Services, which provide industry-leading IFC, wireless in-flight entertainment (W-IFE) and aviation software services to commercial airlines and private business jets. The data capacity of our IFC systems enables all passengers and crew to receive in-flight internet service in the air similar to the internet service available on the ground, supporting applications such as high-speed web browsing, streaming and social media applications. Our W-IFE service is a cloud-based platform providing passengers with access to a wide range of premium entertainment, video and information services maintained on an onboard server and wirelessly delivered direct to passengers’ own devices. As of March 31, 2022, our IFC systems were installed and in service on approximately 1,910 commercial aircraft, of which, due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 80 were inactive at fiscal year end. We anticipate that approximately 970 additional commercial aircraft under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines will be put into service with our IFC systems. However, the timing of installation and entry into service for additional aircraft under existing customer agreements may be delayed due to COVID-19 impacts. Additionally, due to the nature of commercial 

airline contracts, there can be no assurance that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft.
 •Prepaid Internet Services, which offer innovative, affordable, satellite-based connectivity in communities that have little or no access to the internet. The services help foster digital inclusion by enabling millions of people to connect to affordable high-quality internet services via a centralized community hotspot connected to the internet via satellite. We provide Prepaid Internet services in multiple regions in Mexico and Brazil and are trialing services in advance of full service launch in various other countries in South America and Central America.
 •Other Mobile Broadband Services, which include high-speed, satellite-based internet services to seagoing vessels, such as energy offshore vessels, cruise ships, consumer ferries and yachts. In addition, we offer L-band managed services enabling real-time machine-to-machine (M2M) position tracking, management of remote assets and operations and visibility into critical areas of the supply chain. Our high-performance M2M terminals are used for a broad range of applications including emergency response, oil and gas pipeline monitoring, mobile fleet management and high-value asset tracking.
 •Energy Services, which include ultra-secure solutions spanning global IP connectivity, bandwidth-optimized over-the-top applications, satellite-based managed services across multiple satellite frequency bands (Ku- and Ka-band), industrial Internet-of-Things big data enablement and industry-leading machine learning analytics. These services support the evolution of digital enablement, and primarily result from our acquisition of RigNet in April 2021.
 Our ViaSat-3 class satellites are our third-generation, high-capacity Ka-band satellite design and are expected to further improve the speed, availability and cost-efficiency of our proprietary Ka-band satellite network. The satellites will have significantly greater data capacity and geographic coverage than our second-generation ViaSat-2 satellite. Our third-generation satellite design has enhanced ability to flexibly and dynamically allocate capacity by service, time and geography, allowing us to allocate our satellite capacity to markets where bandwidth usage demands and returns are highest. The first ViaSat-3 class satellite is intended to cover the Americas, the second to cover the EMEA region, and the third to cover the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. We are continuing to make good progress on our ViaSat-3 constellation despite delays experienced as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on supply chains and labor availability challenges since the latter part of calendar year 2020. The upcoming launch of the ViaSat-3 (Americas) satellite is anticipated to support the commencement of commercial service on the satellite in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, based on the current target launch date. The actual launch date of the satellite will be dependent on the completion of deliverables by our contract manufacturers, subcontractors and other third-party service providers, available launch windows and other variables.
We believe that growth in our satellite services segment will be driven in the coming years by continued demand for high-speed broadband services across the globe, driven by continued increases in the number of internet users, applications and connected devices. This presents opportunities across a number of Viasat satellite services businesses, including residential, business internet and prepaid internet services. Further growth in our in-flight services business is expected to be driven by the installation of our IFC systems on additional commercial aircraft and the expansion of airlines and flight routes covered by the footprint of our satellite fleet following the launch of our ViaSat-3 constellation. However, we expect that our anticipated growth will be partially offset by ramping start-up expenses in new international and vertical markets and ground network infrastructure investments associated with the launch of our ViaSat-3 constellation, and that growth in our U.S. fixed broadband business will be affected by capacity constraints ahead of the launch of commercial service of the ViaSat-3 (Americas) satellite.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased demand for our premium high-speed plans in our fixed broadband services business, reflecting customers’ increased bandwidth needs in a remote working/distance schooling environment. However, the pandemic also caused a severe decline in global air traffic, which reduced demand for our in-flight services and IFC systems in our satellite services and commercial networks segments, respectively. While domestic airline traffic increased during calendar year 2021 (with increased planes in service and passenger volumes), global airline traffic has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We expect to continue to see some negative impacts on revenues and operating cash flows from our IFC businesses in fiscal year 2023 and potentially beyond, but for the effects to continue to lessen over time with increases in passenger air traffic and the return to service of additional currently inactive aircraft. In fiscal year 2020, prior to the pandemic, less than 10% of our total revenues were generated by services and products provided to commercial airlines reported in our satellite services and commercial networks segments. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business in fiscal year 2023 and potentially beyond will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency, the extent, duration and effectiveness of containment actions taken, the extent of disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains
and economic markets, and the impact of the pandemic on overall supply and demand, global air travel, consumer confidence, discretionary spending levels and levels of economic activity.

 Our Strategy
Our business strategy is to maintain our leadership position in cost-efficient, high-quality satellite-based communications products and services, focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for all. The principal elements of our strategy include:
•Drive Capital Efficiencies
 oDeliver the Most Productive Satellite Systems: We are hyper-focused on maximizing the useful bandwidth per total lifetime capital cost of each satellite. We refer to this as “bandwidth productivity” and see this metric as a key factor in determining our return on satellite investment for each satellite we design, develop and build. When measured in terms of bandwidth productivity, we believe our existing and planned satellite fleet substantially outperforms other satellite operators and would also outperform our expectations for the LEO constellations proposed by new market entrants. 
 oDrive Efficiencies of Scale and Operations: We intend to continue to drive efficiencies in our businesses through our vertical integration strategy and increasing scale as we move into new and adjacent geographic, product and service markets. We optimize our satellite systems through our development of an end-to-end platform of next-generation Ka-band satellites, ground networking equipment and user terminals that enable the provision of a broad array of high-speed broadband services. Our ViaSat-3 class satellites are expected to further drive scale and operational efficiencies through their enhanced ability to efficiently and dynamically match supply and demand through the flexible allocation of capacity by service, time and geography within the satellite footprint, as well as through their expected global geographic reach. 
 •Focus on Relentless Execution
 oMaintain Focus on Technology Leadership: We continue to focus on R&D to bring high-capacity, high-speed broadband communications to the global market. Our continued innovation in satellite system product development has been one of our hallmarks. We intend to maintain our leadership position in satellite systems, technologies and services, while continuing to expand our efforts in wireless communications, cloud networking and security. Our R&D efforts are supported by a global employee base that includes approximately 3,400 engineers and a culture that deeply values and supports innovation. 
 oFollow Our Path of Proven Performance: We have an enviable track record for identifying and bringing to market impactful communications technologies in space systems. ViaSat-1 was the highest capacity communications satellite at the time of its launch; ViaSat-2 almost doubled the capacity of ViaSat-1; and the ViaSat-3 constellation is anticipated to have approximately eight times more capacity than the capacity of the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites combined and to enable us to deliver affordable connectivity across most of the world.
 oCustomer-Centricity Evolution: We are focused on increasing our customer interactions and have incorporated new technologies, tools and learnings from artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhanced customer intimacy techniques and customer advisory councils. We strive to continue to improve our ongoing customer engagements through proactive response, deeper customer insights and enhanced customer exchanges. This is an ongoing effort that will continue to be an investment and nurture opportunity for us.
•Continue to Expand into New Markets and Geographies
 oEnter and Disrupt New and Adjacent Markets through Technology Innovation: We continue to create or address new and adjacent markets using our technological advancements to disrupt existing business models and drive shifts in target markets or user demand. For example, the technological innovations and power of our proprietary Ka-band satellite network enabled us to disrupt the IFC business model and successfully expand our broadband service offerings into the commercial air market. As the capacity and geographic coverage areas of our satellite systems continue to increase with each generation of our high-capacity Ka-band satellite designs, we expect the addressable markets for our broadband technologies, products and services to continue to expand. Higher capacity, more flexible satellites will allow us to offer a broader array of cost-effective, high-quality broadband services that can be tailored to different geographic regions and bandwidth usage demand. 
 oThink Beyond Current Customer Requirements to Open New Markets: In our government systems business, we actively identify market or operational needs that are not currently served by existing communications and encryption products and services, with a view to developing unique or disruptive products and services and creating new addressable markets. In fact, a key component to the continued success of Viasat’s defense business is its expansive portfolio of non-developmental items (NDI), which are designed to rapidly deliver cutting-edge technology solutions well ahead of the traditional government procurement model. Many of our NDI technologies fall within our tactical data links systems, such as BATS-D handheld Link 16 radios and STT KOR-24A 2-channel radios for manned and unmanned applications. Our business model delivers advanced capabilities significantly faster, at lower lifecycle costs and with lower risk to the customer when compared to traditional defense acquisition programs and timelines. 
 oTarget International Expansion. With the impending launch of our ViaSat-3 constellation, we have placed tremendous effort on growing our operations, sales/distribution, customer/partner base and regulatory framework globally. We continue to believe that international markets provide attractive opportunities for the long-term growth of our business. As worldwide demand for broadband connectivity continues to grow, we expect that our comprehensive offering of next-generation Ka-band satellites, advanced end-to-end communication systems and ground networking equipment and products, and their ability to enable a wide range of cost-effective, high-speed, high-quality broadband services, will be increasingly attractive internationally. Our ViaSat-2 satellite significantly expanded the geographic coverage area of our broadband services over North and Central America and the primary aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean, allowing us to bring high-value in-flight services to many more commercial, business and government aircraft within the expanded satellite footprint and launch new, innovative ground-based services in new markets, such as our Prepaid Internet services using satellite-powered community hotspots. Ahead of the ViaSat-3 constellation launch, we have leveraged third-party partner satellites (such as Telebras in Brazil, Avanti in EMEA, nbn in Australia and China Satcom in China) to create a runway for Viasat to begin offering and trialing service plans internationally as well as build brand presence and name recognition. We have also undertaken a thoughtful approach to mergers and acquisitions to drive international expansion. For example, in the Inmarsat Transaction, Inmarsat’s existing satellite fleet would provide global coverage (including strong oceanic coverage and polar reach) and greater redundancy and resiliency for the combined company versus Viasat on a standalone basis. The acquisition of the remaining interest in EBI is expected to enable us to expand more effectively and rapidly in the EMEA region. Our recent acquisition of RigNet also positions us to further expand into new global markets, as RigNet has customers and operations globally. Finally, we expect our ViaSat-3 and ViaSat-4 global constellations will be enablers for the scalable, long-term global expansion of our business, providing the platform for us to deliver high-quality and affordable broadband connectivity worldwide. Demand profile differs by geographic market, reflecting geographic, economic, political, regulatory and other factors. However, the flexibility, high data capacity and broad geographic coverage area of our second- and third-generation proprietary Ka-band satellites allow us to tailor our service offerings for the opportunities and needs of different geographic markets.

•Prioritize the End-User
 oRecognize Broadband Connectivity is a Means to an End, not an End in Itself. The value of a broadband network is in the applications it enables. With this understanding, we have worked closely with leading edge and content providers (including companies such as Apple, Facebook, fuboTV and the NBA, among others) to enhance end-users’ experiences with their online and streaming media services over our network, helping them leverage the potential of making affordable broadband available in places where it has never been. We also work with U.S. Government agencies, major airlines and others on multiple continents to help ensure end-users have great — and affordable — broadband experiences on our network. Our ViaSat-3 constellation will help meet increasing end-user demand and the need for global reach. In addition, we work with various international governments to help bring digital and social inclusion to their constituents through efficient satellite-enabled services such as our Prepaid Internet hotspots. By making broadband connectivity accessible to millions of people living in regions where traditional terrestrial and wireless internet services were either non-existent or cost prohibitive, we have been able to help generate positive socio-economic impacts — in education, e-commerce, finance, healthcare and more — at lower bandwidth costs.
 •Manage for the Long Term
 oPursue Growth Through Strategic Alliances, Partnering Arrangements and Relationships. We actively seek strategic relationships and joint ventures with companies whose financial, marketing, operational or technological resources can accelerate the introduction of new technologies, service offerings and/or the penetration of new markets. For example, we have entered into strategic agreements in Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru with local partners to bring high-speed, affordable internet to unserved and underserved communities, which allows us to gain market insights and build brand awareness in advance of when our ViaSat-3 constellation will provide additional capacity to the region. In our government systems segment, we also regularly enter into teaming arrangements with other government contractors to more effectively capture complex government programs. We may continue to evaluate acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary companies, businesses, products or technologies to supplement our internal growth.
 oEncourage Safe Sustainable Access to Space. We strive to be a leader in bringing benefits of space technology to the world in a sustainable, responsible and inclusive way. We are focused on cooperating with a broad range of responsible nations and global partners to ensure safe, responsible and equitable access to space for all.
 Our Customers
Our customer base is highly diversified. Customers of our satellite services segment reflect the diversity in our broadband service offerings and include residential customers, small and medium-sized businesses, enterprise customers, commercial airlines and Prepaid Internet hotspot users. Customers of our fixed broadband services are obtained through either our direct or partner distribution channels. The customers of our government systems and commercial networks segments include the DoD, the U.S. National Security Agency, the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FVEY and other allied foreign governments and militaries, select other U.S. federal, state and local government agencies, commercial and defense contractors, satellite network integrators, large communications service providers and enterprises requiring complex communications and networking solutions. We enter into government contracts either directly with U.S. or foreign governments, or indirectly through domestic or international partners or resellers. In our commercial networks segment, we also act as both a prime contractor and subcontractor for the sale of equipment and services.
Revenues from the U.S. Government as an individual customer comprised approximately 25%, 30% and 30% of total revenues for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. None of our other customers comprised 10% or more of total revenues in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.
U.S. Government Contracts
Substantial portions of our revenues are generated from contracts and subcontracts with the DoD and other federal government agencies. Many of our contracts are subject to a competitive bid process and are awarded on the basis of technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience and price. We also receive some contract awards involving special technical capabilities on a negotiated, noncompetitive basis due to our unique mix of communication products, satellite services, engineering capabilities and technical expertise in specialized areas. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 has encouraged the use of commercial type pricing, such as firm fixed-price contracts, on dual use products. Our future revenues and income could be materially affected by changes in government procurement policies and related
oversight, a reduction in expenditures for the products and services we provide, and other risks generally associated with federal government contracts.
We provide products under federal government contracts that usually require performance over a period of several months to multiple years. Long-term contracts may be conditioned upon continued availability of congressional appropriations. Variances between anticipated budget and congressional appropriations may result in a delay, reduction or termination of these contracts.
Our federal government contracts are performed under cost-reimbursement contracts, time-and-materials contracts and fixed-price contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of costs and payment of a fee. The fee may be either fixed by the contract or variable, based upon cost control, quality, delivery and the customer’s subjective evaluation of the work. Under time-and-materials contracts, we receive a fixed amount by labor category for services performed and are reimbursed for the cost of materials purchased to perform the contract. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree to perform specific work, which may include product R&D, for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize the benefit or detriment to the extent that the actual cost of performing the work differs from the contract price. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 11% of our total government revenues were generated from cost-reimbursement contracts with the federal government or our prime contractors, less than 1% from time-and-materials contracts and approximately 89% from fixed-price contracts.
Our allowable federal government contract costs and fees are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contracting Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), as discussed below under “— Regulatory Environment — Other Regulations.”
Our federal government contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. Government. If a termination for convenience occurs, the U.S. Government generally is obligated to pay for work completed or services rendered and/or the cost incurred by us under the contract, which may include a fee or allowance for profit. Contracts with prime contractors may have negotiated termination schedules that apply. When we participate as a subcontractor, we are at risk if the prime contractor does not perform its contract. Similarly, when we act as a prime contractor employing subcontractors, we are at risk if a subcontractor does not perform its subcontract.
Some of our federal government contracts contain options that are exercisable at the discretion of the customer. An option may extend the period of performance for one or more years for additional consideration on terms and conditions similar to those contained in the original contract. An option may also increase the level of effort and assign new tasks to us.
 Our eligibility to perform under our federal government contracts requires us to maintain adequate security measures. We have implemented security procedures that we believe adequately satisfy the requirements of our federal government contracts.
Research and Development
The industries in which we compete are subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements and continuing developments in the communications and networking environment. Our continuing ability to adapt to these changes, and to develop innovative satellite and communications technologies, and new and enhanced products and services, is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. Therefore, we continue to make significant investments in next-generation satellite technologies and communications product and services development.
We conduct the majority of our R&D activities in-house and have R&D and engineering staff, which includes approximately 3,400 engineers worldwide. Our product development activities focus on products that we consider viable revenue opportunities to support all of our segments. We incurred $153.2 million, $115.8 million and $130.4 million during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on independent research and development (IR&D) expenses, which comprise R&D not directly funded by a third party. Funded R&D contains a profit component and is therefore not directly comparable to IR&D. As a U.S. Government contractor, we also are able to recover a portion of our IR&D expenses, consisting primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies and prototype materials related to R&D programs.
 Intellectual Property
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We have registered a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries
and have a substantial number of patent filings pending determination. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking, satellite and wireless communications industries and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protections afforded by patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual rights. Accordingly, while these legal protections are important, they must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, and the continued development of new products and product enhancements.
Certain of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain these licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Sales and Marketing
We have a sales presence in various domestic and international locations, and we sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through partners, as described below:
•Satellite Services Sales Organization. Our satellite services sales organization for our broadband internet services sells through both direct and indirect channels. Our residential fixed broadband services are primarily sold directly to customers through our Viasat Internet website, sales call centers and active retail dealers. We utilize extensive dealer networks across the United States, as well as in each country where residential fixed broadband services are offered. Our Prepaid Internet services are sold through local distribution partnerships. Our business internet offerings are sold through a mix of direct sales personnel who work with enterprises and a network of enterprise-focused master agents and wholesale distribution partners. Our commercial aviation offerings are sold direct to airlines, and our business aviation offerings are sold through direct sales and business development personnel as well as through aviation-focused value-added resellers. Our maritime service offerings are sold through direct and indirect value-added reseller partners targeting a variety of maritime commercial prospects. In each case, our focus is to identify business opportunities and develop solutions for the unique needs of each customer segment. 
 •Commercial Networks Sales Organization. Our commercial networks sales organization consists of sales managers and sales engineers, who act as the primary interface to establish account relationships and determine technical requirements for customer networks. In addition to our sales force, we maintain a highly-trained service staff to provide technical product and service support to our customers. The sales cycle in the commercial network market is often lengthy and it is not unusual for a sale to take up to 18 months from the initial contact through the execution of the agreement. The sales process often includes several network design iterations, network demonstrations and pilot networks consisting of a few sites. 
 •Government Systems Sales Organization. Our government systems sales organization consists of both direct sales personnel who sell our standard products and services, and business development personnel who work with engineers, program managers, marketing managers and contract managers to identify business opportunities, develop customer relationships, develop solutions for customers’ needs, prepare proposals and negotiate contractual arrangements. The period of time from initial contact through the point of product sale and delivery can take over three years for more complex product developments. Products already in production can usually be delivered to a customer between 90 to 180 days from the point of product sale.
 •Strategic Partners. To augment our direct sales efforts, we seek to develop key strategic relationships to market and sell our products and services. We direct our sales and marketing efforts to our strategic partners, primarily through our senior management relationships. In some cases a strategic ally may be the prime contractor for a system or network installation and will subcontract a portion of the project to us. In other cases, 

the strategic ally may recommend us as the prime contractor for the design and integration of the network. We seek strategic relationships and partners based on many factors, including financial resources, technical capability, geographic location and market presence.
Our marketing team works closely with our corporate and segment leadership, customer account executives, and business development, sales and operations organizations to increase the awareness of the Viasat brand through a mix of positive program performance, agile, results-oriented multichannel marketing campaigns that reflect new and evolving customer journeys, public relations, paid media, live and virtual trade show participation and conference speaking engagements that keep the market current on our services, products and features. Viasat products and services, both in the U.S. and internationally, are typically sold under one unified master global brand, using a single logo and visual identity system. Our marketing team also identifies and sizes new and adjacent target markets for our products and services, creates awareness of our company and our portfolio of offerings, and generates contacts and leads within these targeted markets.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to solutions that offer higher capacity and speed and other superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. In many cases our competitors can also be our customers or partners. Accordingly, maintaining an open and cooperative relationship is important. The overall number of our competitors may increase, and the identity and composition of competitors may change. As we continue to expand our business globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions.
To compete, we emphasize:
•the high-speed, high-quality and broad geographic availability of our broadband services; 
 •our deep understanding of our customers’ unique expectations and requirements;
 •our proven designs and network integration services for complex, customized network needs; 
 •our demonstrated performance in uniquely challenging environments;
 •the increased bandwidth efficiency offered by our networks, products and services; 
 •our advanced security and information assurance capabilities;
 •the innovative and flexible features integrated into our products and services; 
 •our network management experience; 
 •our end-to-end network implementation capabilities; 
 •the distinct advantages of satellite data networks; 
 •the technical advantages and advanced features of our antenna systems as compared to our competitors’ offerings; and 
 •the overall cost-effectiveness of our communications systems, products and services. 
 While we believe we compete successfully on each of these factors, we expect to continue to face intense competition in each of our markets.
In our satellite services segment, we face competition for fixed broadband services both from existing competitors and emerging technologies. Our fixed broadband service offerings compete with broadband service offerings from wireline and wireless telecommunications companies, including cable companies, fiber and DSL companies, satellite companies and fixed wireless companies. Many of our competitors are larger than us, have substantial capital resources, have greater brand recognition, have access to spectrum or technologies not available to us, or are able to offer bundled service offerings that we are not able to duplicate, all of which may reduce demand for our broadband services. This has in part driven our strategic focus on suburban and rural geographies outside of the cable and fiber competitive footprint. New entrants, some with significant financial resources and new emerging technologies (including terrestrial and space-based networks, such as LEO and MEO constellations) also compete with our broadband service offerings. Additionally, wireless telecommunications carriers such as AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are currently offering unlimited wireless data plans and fixed wireless services that could attract our existing and future fixed broadband subscribers. Our IFC and W-IFE service offerings compete against air-to-ground mobile services and other satellite-based services, such as the services offered by Anuvu (formerly Global Eagle), Gogo, Inmarsat, Intelsat, SES, SpaceX, Thales Group, SmartSky, Iridium and Panasonic Avionics Corporation, among others.

In our commercial networks segment, we compete with numerous other providers of satellite and terrestrial communications systems, products and equipment, including: CPI Antenna Systems Division, Comtech, EchoStar (Hughes Network Systems), General Dynamics, Gilat, iDirect Technologies, Newtec, L3Harris, Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Safran Aerosystems, Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) (MAXAR), SpaceX and Thales Group. In addition, some of our customers continuously evaluate whether to develop and manufacture their own products and could elect to compete with us at any time.
Within our government systems segment, we generally compete with government communications service providers and manufacturers of defense electronics products, systems or subsystems, such as BAE Systems, Collins Aerospace, General Dynamics, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Iridium, Eutelsat, OneWeb, SES, SpaceX, Telesat, L3Harris, EchoStar (Hughes Network Systems) and similar companies. We may also compete directly with the largest defense prime contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies Corporation. In many cases we partner with our competitors, and therefore maintaining an open and cooperative relationship is important.
Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including strong customer relationships, more experience with regulatory compliance, greater financial and management resources and access to technologies not available to us. Many of our competitors are also substantially larger than we are and may have more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changing technology or market conditions or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing objective is to produce high-quality products that conform to specifications at the lowest possible manufacturing cost. To achieve this objective, we primarily utilize a range of contract manufacturers that are selected based on the production volumes and complexity of the product. By employing contract manufacturers, we are able to reduce the costs of products and support rapid fluctuations in delivery rates when needed. As part of our manufacturing process, we conduct extensive testing and quality control procedures for all products before they are delivered to customers.
Contract manufacturers produce products for many different customers and are able to pass on the benefits of large-scale manufacturing to their customers. These manufacturers are able to produce high quality products at lower costs by: (1) exercising their high-volume purchasing power, (2) employing advanced and efficient production equipment and capital intensive systems whose costs are leveraged across their broad customer base, and (3) using a cost-effective skilled workforce. Our primary contract manufacturers include Benchmark, IEC Electronics Corporation, L3Harris, Microelectronics Technology, Plexus, Regal Technology Partners and Sanmina.
Our experienced management team facilitates an efficient contract manufacturing process through the development of strong relationships with a number of different domestic and off-shore contract manufacturers. By negotiating beneficial contract provisions and purchasing some of the equipment needed to manufacture our products, we retain the ability to move the production of our products from one contract manufacturing source to another if required. Our operations management has experience in the successful transition from in-house production to contract manufacturing. The degree to which we employ contract manufacturing depends on the maturity of the product and the forecasted production life cycle. We intend to limit our internal manufacturing capacity to supporting new product development activities, building customized products that need to be manufactured in strict accordance with a customer’s specifications or delivery schedules, and building proprietary, highly sensitive Viasat-designed products and components for use in our proprietary technology platform. Therefore, our internal manufacturing capability for standard products has been, and is expected to continue to be, very limited and we intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturers for large-scale manufacturing. Our internal manufacturing capability is dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. We use numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials required for our operations and our products, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics. Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. We also rely on outside vendors to manufacture specific components and subassemblies used in the production of our products. Some components, subassemblies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole source supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
Regulatory Environment
We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with the services that we provide. In particular, we provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. National authorities generally require that the satellites they authorize be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the United Nations, which require the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum.
We also produce a variety of communications systems and networking equipment, the design, manufacture, and marketing of which are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we sell such equipment. We are subject to export control laws and regulations, and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, with respect to the export of such systems and equipment. As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. procurement laws and regulations.
Radio-frequency and Communications Regulation
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the ITU’s regulations, including its frequency registration and coordination procedures, and its various provisions on spectrum usage. Those procedures are specified in the ITU Radio Regulations and seek to facilitate shared international use of limited spectrum and orbital resources in a manner that avoids harmful interference. Among other things, the ITU regulations set forth procedures for establishing international priority with respect to the use of such resources, deadlines for bringing satellite networks into use in order to maintain such priority, and coordination rights and obligations with respect to other networks, which vary depending on whether such networks have higher or lower ITU priority.
 The ITU regulations provide allocations or designations for how spectrum can be used for various purposes, and whether such uses operate on a primary or secondary basis with respect to one another. Secondary uses may not cause harmful interference to primary uses, and may not claim interference protection from primary uses.
 On our behalf, various countries have made ITU filings, and may in the future make additional filings, for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used, or may in the future be used, by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire. In the event that any international coordination process that is triggered by such an ITU filing is not successfully completed, or bringing into use deadlines or requirements are not satisfied, we may be compelled to accept more limited or suboptimal orbital and spectrum rights, to operate the applicable satellite(s) on a non-interference basis, or to cease operating such satellite(s) altogether. The orbital arc is becoming increasingly congested with respect to such ITU filings and the satellite networks operated under those filings.
 In addition, the ITU’s Radio Regulations are subject to change at periodic ITU World Radio-communication Conferences (WRCs), and their application is determined by various governing bodies within the ITU. WRCs typically are convened approximately every four years, with the next one scheduled to occur in 2023. The next WRC is considering various changes to the Radio Regulations that address the terms and conditions under which spectrum is used for satellite and terrestrial and purposes, and future WRCs are likely to do the same.
Spectrum
The space stations and ground networks we use to provide our broadband services rely on access to spectrum within each country in which we do business. Use of such spectrum is authorized by regulatory authorities within each country (or a regional authority whose jurisdiction over spectrum rights encompasses that country), which determine the terms and conditions for access to and use of that spectrum in that particular country. The terms and conditions for access can and do vary by country, may differ from the ITU’s Radio Regulations, and may change over time. In particular, the growing demand for both satellite and terrestrial communications services is causing many countries to evaluate how spectrum is used within their borders, and to consider changes in the local terms and conditions for access to and use of spectrum. Those terms and conditions affect, among other things, the extent to which, and how, we must share spectrum with other spectrum users, including terrestrial and satellite uses, and whether we must operate on a secondary basis in some cases. Most of the spectrum on which we rely is shared with other satellite networks, including those operating in different orbits that could cross our orbital location and result in interference conditions. In many countries, portions of the spectrum on which we rely also are shared with terrestrial wireless services.

If the deployment of new terrestrial or satellite networks results in harmful interference into our satellite operations, or if the implementation of those networks under newly adopted terms and conditions constrains or prohibits the types of spectrum uses for which we have planned in a manner that we do not anticipate, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Broadband Services
 We provide high-speed broadband internet access and VoIP services to customers in the United States, as well as in Europe and Latin America and on aircraft and seagoing vessels travelling around the world. Our provision of these services is subject to a number of legal obligations, including requirements to obtain licenses, authorizations and/or registrations to provide service in or to a given jurisdiction, implementation of certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement, and open internet requirements. Legislators and regulators often consider changes to existing statutes, rules and requirements, or prescribe new ones, which could significantly impact the ability to comply, or the costs of complying with, these types of obligations, or that otherwise could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide service in a given jurisdiction.
US Regulation
The commercial use of radio-frequency spectrum in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act). The FCC is responsible for licensing the operation of satellite earth stations and spacecraft, regulating the technical and other aspects of the operation of these facilities, and regulating certain aspects of the provision of services to customers.
Earth Stations. The Communications Act requires a license for the operation of transmitting satellite earth station facilities and certain receiving satellite earth station facilities in the United States. We currently hold licenses authorizing us to operate various earth stations within the United States, including but not limited to user terminals and facilities that aggregate traffic and interconnect with the internet backbone and network hubs. These licenses typically are granted for 15 year terms, and typically are renewed in the ordinary course. Material changes in earth station operations would require prior approval by the FCC. The operation of our earth stations is subject to various license conditions, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations.
Space Stations. In the United States, the FCC authorizes the launch and operation of commercial spacecraft, and also authorizes non-U.S. licensed spacecraft to be used to serve the United States. The FCC has authorized the use of the ViaSat-1, ViaSat-2, WildBlue-1, Anik F2 and one ViaSat-3 class spacecraft to serve the United States. The use of these spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations.
Universal Service and other Broadband Subsidies. Certain of our services may constitute the provision of telecommunications to, from or within the United States, and may require us to contribute a percentage of our revenues from such services to universal service support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries and rural health care providers. This percentage is set each calendar quarter by the FCC, and currently is 23.8%. Current FCC rules permit us to pass this universal service contribution through to our customers. The FCC has established universal service funding mechanisms to support the provision of voice and broadband services in certain high-cost areas of the United States. These supporting mechanisms are known as the Connect America Fund (CAF) and the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). In addition, under the new Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, funding for broadband service is expected to be distributed by U.S. states and territories under the oversight and administration of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Among other things, the CAF, RDOF and BEAD mechanisms provide, or will likely provide, support to terrestrial service providers under terms and conditions that are not available to satellite-based service providers. The CAF and RDOF mechanisms could provide other service providers a competitive advantage in providing broadband services in supported areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, Viasat has been selected as the winning bidder with respect to $122.5 million in support under the CAF program to serve certain portions of the country, and must comply with federal and state obligations imposed in connection with such support.
 CALEA. We are obligated to comply with the requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which requires telecommunications providers and broadband internet access providers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services.
Net Neutrality. In February 2015, the FCC adopted new rules intended to preserve the openness of the internet, a concept generally referred to as “net neutrality” or “open internet.” The FCC’s “net neutrality” rules, among other things, prohibited all ISPs from: (i) blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices (subject to an
exception for “reasonable network management”); (ii) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices (subject to the same exception); (iii) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind whatsoever; and (iv) unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of end users to access content or the ability of content providers to access end users (again subject to the exception for “reasonable network management”). ISPs also are obligated to make certain disclosures to consumers with respect to their network management policies.
In adopting these rules, the FCC relied on Title II of the Communications Act, which authorizes the FCC to regulate telecommunications common carriers. More specifically, the FCC reclassified mass-market retail broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to common-carrier regulation under Title II, reversing longstanding precedent classifying broadband as a lightly regulated “information service” not subject to such regulation. Such common-carrier regulation potentially could have included review of the reasonableness of an ISP’s rates and practices.
In January 2018, the FCC adopted an order restoring the classification of broadband internet access service as a lightly regulated information service, ending the Title II regulatory approach adopted in 2015. The order eliminated explicit requirements against blocking or throttling traffic and paid prioritization of traffic. At the same time, the FCC maintained the consumer disclosure requirements with some modifications and acknowledged the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission to enforce consumer protection measures. The 2018 order was largely upheld by the D.C. Circuit, though it may be revisited by the FCC in the future. In addition, legislative proposals that would restore net neutrality requirements are being considered in Congress, and some states have recently adopted portions of the net neutrality requirements. Some legislative actions at the state level are being challenged in courts on federal preemption and other grounds. We cannot predict the outcome of these pending lawsuits or regulatory and legislative efforts, or any resulting impact on ISPs.
Privacy and Data Security. We are subject to federal and state laws concerning the privacy of consumers and the security we apply to their personal information. Certain of these laws provide privacy protections for certain types of personal information related to our voice services (referred to by such laws as customer proprietary network information). The Federal Trade Commission also oversees consumer privacy and data security more broadly through its authority to take enforcement action for unfair or deceptive practices, and state consumer protection laws can prompt review of privacy practices by state attorneys general. In addition, certain states have established specific consumer privacy and data security requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act that will amend the CCPA in January 2023, which combined give California residents, among other things, the right to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as rights to access, delete, and restrict the sale and sharing of certain personal information collected about them by us and our service providers. State laws continue to multiply and evolve, and as various states pass their own comprehensive privacy laws, we and our business customers and partners could be exposed to additional regulatory complexities and obligations. Many states also have enacted security breach notification laws requiring notice to consumers and government agencies upon disclosure of certain information to an unauthorized party resulting from a security breach; in addition, the SEC is considering enhanced requirements related to the reporting of material cybersecurity incidents.
 Foreign Regulation
 Our operation of spacecraft and ground network and our provision of services to customers outside of the United States are subject to legal requirements of the jurisdictions issuing the satellite authorizations and in which Viasat provides services. These include obtaining the market access, spectrum access and licenses, authorizations and/or registrations that are necessary to operate or provide service in or to a given jurisdiction, and in many cases licenses for the operation of transmitting satellite earth station facilities and certain receiving satellite earth station facilities. In particular, we must obtain authority to operate various earth stations outside the United States, including but not limited to user terminals and facilities that aggregate traffic and interconnect with the internet backbone and network hubs. This authority is subject to conditions and limitations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
The spacecraft we use in our business are subject to the regulatory authority of, and conditions imposed by, foreign governments, as well as contractual arrangements with third parties and the rules and procedures of the ITU. Our ViaSat-1 satellite operates under authority granted to ManSat Limited by the governments of the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom (as well as authority from the FCC), and pursuant to contractual arrangements we have with ManSat Limited that extend past the expected useful life of ViaSat-1. ViaSat-2 operates under the authority of the United Kingdom. We also use Ka-band capacity on the Anik F2 satellite to provide our broadband services under an agreement with Telesat Canada, and we may do so until the end of the useful life of that satellite. Telesat Canada operates that satellite under authority granted to it by the government of Canada. We also currently use the WildBlue-1 satellite, which we own, and which is co-located with Anik F2 under authority granted to Telesat Canada by the government of Canada, and pursuant to an agreement we have with Telesat Canada that expires upon the end of the useful life of Anik F2. Accordingly, we are
reliant upon ManSat Limited and Telesat Canada maintaining their respective governmental rights on which our operating rights are based. The use of these spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations held by us, ManSat Limited and Telesat Canada, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the rules and regulations of those jurisdictions.
 We are also subject to certain other forms of foreign regulation in connection with our provision of communications services. In the area of privacy, we are subject to existing, new, and evolving laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate. For instance, certain of our business units are subject to the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes transparency, accountability, data protection, cross-border data transfer, and other obligations on Viasat both as a data controller and a data processor of the personal data of individuals in the EU. Privacy laws and regulations can be subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate also impose requirements related to network management practices, cooperation with local law enforcement agencies, and other matters. A smaller number of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted laws enabling the government to suspend ISP services in the country.
 Equipment Design, Manufacture, and Marketing
We must comply with the applicable laws and regulations and, where required, obtain the approval of the regulatory authority of each country in which we design, manufacture, or market our communications systems and networking equipment. Applicable laws and regulatory requirements vary from country to country, and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products, generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies. The delays inherent in this government approval process have in the past caused and may in the future cause the cancellation, postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communication systems by our customers, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the sale of our products to the customers.
Equipment Testing and Verification. Certain equipment that we manufacture must comply with applicable technical requirements intended to minimize radio interference to other communications services and ensure product safety. In the United States, the FCC is responsible for ensuring that communications devices comply with technical requirements for minimizing radio interference and human exposure to radio emissions. Other regulators perform similar functions around the world. These types of requirements typically provide for equipment to be tested either by the manufacturer or by a private testing organization to ensure compliance with the applicable technical requirements. In some cases, the regulator requires submission of an application, which must be approved by the regulator or a private testing organization accredited by the regulator.
Export Controls. Due to the nature and sophistication of our communications products, we must comply with applicable U.S. Government and other agency regulations regarding the handling and export of certain of our products. This often requires extra or special handling of these products and could increase our costs. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial harm to the company, including fines, penalties and the forfeiture of future rights to sell or export these products.
Aviation-Related Regulation
 Aircraft Modification. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for the regulation and oversight of civil aviation within the United States. The FAA develops and enforces airworthiness standards and regulations that certify the industry’s ability to manufacture aircraft and aircraft components, perform modification and maintenance activities on aircraft, and repair equipment previously installed on aircraft. We interact with the FAA regarding aircraft modification through two main activities: (1) supporting Type Certificate (TC) activity with an aircraft original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to obtain linefit certification of our IFC and W-IFE equipment and (2) obtaining a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to enable the retrofit of our IFC and W-IFE equipment. With respect to TC activity, the OEM is responsible for full certification and FAA regulatory compliance and we are responsible for providing certified equipment to the OEM. With respect to STC activity, we typically use Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) to support holding and maintaining our STCs to ensure FAA regulatory compliance. Our commercial aviation business depends on our ability to interact with the FAA and ODAs, as well as FAA-certified engineering professionals, in order to access data and obtain authorizations and approvals.
Parts Manufacturing Approval. We have a wide range of products supporting both commercial and business aviation customers. The FAA, under its Part Manufacturing Approval (PMA) program, provides authorization to entities like us and our vendors to manufacture and deliver IFC and W-IFE equipment. These approvals are provided through assigned FAA Manufacturing Inspection District Offices and are subject to strict rules and ongoing oversight. We have been able to obtain PMA on our entire fleet of current IFC and W-IFE product offerings due to multiple licensing agreements with both OEMs for linefit installations and ODAs for retrofit installations.

FAA Part 145 Repair Stations. The FAA has approved several of our locations as 14 CFR Part 145 repair stations, which enables us to provide ongoing support to customers with respect to our IFC and W-IFE systems. These repair stations support both line-replaceable unit (LRU) and line maintenance activities associated with our IFC and W-IFE products. These approvals are provided and overseen by FAA Flight Standards District Offices. We have also obtained European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approval for our repair stations dedicated to LRU repair and maintenance for our IFC and W-IFE products.
 Other Regulations
As a government contractor, we are routinely subject to audit and review by the DCMA, the DCAA and other U.S. Government agencies of our performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, accounting and management internal control business systems, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. Both contractors and the U.S. Government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. In particular, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. Increases in congressional scrutiny and investigations into business practices and major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation and profitability if we are among the targeted companies. An adverse outcome to a review or audit or other failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could result in material civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions being imposed on us, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, significant customer refunds, fines and suspension, or a prohibition on doing business with U.S. Government agencies. In addition, if we fail to obtain an “adequate” determination of our various accounting and management internal control business systems from applicable U.S. Government agencies or if allegations of impropriety are made against us, we could suffer serious harm to our business or our reputation, including our ability to bid on new contracts or receive contract renewals or our competitive position in the bidding process. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are also subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. The failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations. To date, these regulations have not had a material effect on our business, as we have neither incurred significant costs to maintain compliance nor to remedy past noncompliance, and we do not expect such regulations to have a material effect on our business in the current fiscal year.
Seasonality
In our satellite services segment, historically subscriber activity for our fixed broadband services has been influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods, with new sales activity generally anticipated to be higher in the second half of the calendar year. However, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by other factors which may either offset or magnify any anticipated seasonal effects, including availability of capacity, promotional and subscriber retention efforts, changes in our resellers, distributors and wholesalers, changes in the competitive landscape, economic conditions, and changes in credit check and subscriber approval processes. In addition, we typically see increased demand for our IFC services from airline passengers during peak holiday travel periods.
Our commercial networks segment is not generally affected by seasonal impacts. In our government systems segment, our results are impacted by various factors including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Human Capital
 As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 7,000 individuals worldwide, with 84% of our workforce located in the United States. We consistently engage with our employees and generally consider the relationships with our employees to be positive, with a significant majority stating that they are proud to work at Viasat. Competition for technical personnel in our industry is intense. We believe our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, engage and retain qualified personnel.
Viasat has a long history of putting people first. We believe that one of the most important investments we make is in our people. Our mission to connect the world depends on our ability to come together as one team to make a positive impact. As a global team, we take pride in our culture of teamwork, trust and collaboration. We prioritize our employees’ health and well-being to ensure we are all able to do our best work. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly transitioned teams to a work-from-home model and equipped them with the resources to perform their jobs safely. For certain employees, whose roles needed to be performed onsite, we deployed a robust set of safety protocols aligned with then-current medical best practices and government mandates. We also introduced additional resources and benefits, including mental health and well-being resources and paid time off for COVID-19-related issues.
Our key pillars of human capital management are ensuring the health and safety of our employees, developing talented people, fostering diversity and inclusion and engaging communities. We believe that our long-term success is in large part dependent on our success across these dimensions, and we will continue to invest in and prioritize these areas in the future.
