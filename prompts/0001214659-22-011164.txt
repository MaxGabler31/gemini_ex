Corporate Organization. Our corporate organization and structure as of December 31, 2021 and this Amendment Two are as follows. Percentages show percentage ownership of a company’s voting equity securities.
 


The Company is a U.S. public holding company that conducts all revenue generating operations solely through: (1) Value Exchange International (China) Limited, a Hong Kong company, and its three wholly owned subsidiaries, which are based in Hong Kong, China and Philippines. The Company’s operating subsidiaries provide certain aspects of the information technology services and consulting business or “IT Business” in. their respective local markets. The Company’s practice has been to establish an operating subsidiary in the market being served by that operating subsidiary.
 
Principal business of Company and its Subsidiaries. Company is a U.S. public holding company and does not directly operate any revenue generating businesses in the U.S. or any other nation. Its role is executive oversight of its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries have no assets, operations, revenue sources or personnel in the United States, excepting one Company board member who is a U.S. resident and U.S. citizen. The business of the each of the Company’s subsidiaries are described in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results at page 28 below.

Operational Strategy. Each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is incorporated in and primarily conducts its business operations and services a customer base primarily within the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized. The Company’s operating subsidiaries’ business operations tend to be local, not international, in focus and scope, and do not typically engage in the sort of international commerce, transactions and data flow, excepting possible occasional Chinese-Hong Kong cross border commerce or transactions, that is the current focus of some of the Chinese government’s recent concerns and regulatory initiatives. Due to the ability and willingness of the Chinese government to impose its will through legislation, regulation and direct intervention in Hong Kong economic, commercial, regulatory and legal affairs, and to do so with little or no prior notice, and without the ability of persons and entities affected by these Chinese government actions to alter, ameliorate or avoid the impact of Chinese government actions, any Chinese government actions that do not directly affect the Company and its operating subsidiaries as of the date of the filing of this Amendment Two may evolve or change to have a direct, potentially adverse or disastrous impact on the Company and its Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries, the Company as a U.S. public holding company with its Common Stock quoted on the OTCQB and value of Company securities. This impact could include the inability of the Company to continue as a U.S. public holding company with its securities traded in the United States or to accept investments from U.S. Investors.
 
The Company’s operating subsidiary in Manila, Philippines is likewise focused and limited in scope to servicing local Filipino customer base. The Philippines has a legal, political and economic system similar to the United States system and does not, despite recent political upheaval, have the same level of uncertainties and risks for the Company as in China and Hong Kong. Except for the subsidiary in Manilla, Philippines, the Company’s operating subsidiaries are in Hong Kong or China and those subsidiaries generate the majority of the Company’s operating revenues.
 
Cash Flow between Company and its Direct and Indirect Subsidiaries. Cash flow between and among the Company and its operating subsidiaries is described in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results, Cash Flow, on page 28 below.
 
Company is not a Variable Interest Entity or “VIE”. Company does not have or intend to set up any subsidiary or enter into any contractual arrangements to establish a variable interest entity (“VIE”) structure with any entity in China or Hong Kong.
 
Chinese law imposes restrictions on foreign ownership of Chinese entities in certain industry segments, especially certain Internet and technology industry segments deemed vital to Chinese national security by the Chinese government. A “variable interest entity” or “VIE” has been used for approximately 20 years as a contractual structure to allow foreign ownership interests in certain Chinese-based industries. A VIE structure consists of a China-based operating company establishing an offshore shell company in a foreign jurisdiction, like the United States or the Cayman Islands, to issue stock to public shareholders. The shell company typically enters into service and other contracts with the China-based operating company or companies, then issues shares after being listed or quoted on a foreign securities exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or The OTC Markets Group QB Venture Market/QX Market. While the shell company has no equity ownership in the China-based operating company or companies in a VIE structure, for accounting purposes the shell company is able to consolidate the Chinese-based operating company or companies into its financial statements under applicable accounting standards.
 
The Company was not incorporated to be, or structured as, a VIE and does not operate as a VIE. The Company was established as a U.S. based holding company that owns all of the voting equity securities of VEI CHN, which in turns own 100% of the voting equity securities of its three operating subsidiaries. The Company’s control and ownership of the foreign operating subsidiaries is based on ownership of a controlling percentage of the issued voting capital securities and not contractual arrangements.
 
The Company’s growth strategy is based on owning all or controlling percentage of voting equity security ownership of subsidiaries located in the markets in which they will conduct business. The Company’s strategic goal is to establish operating subsidiaries in various parts of Asia. Any expansion beyond China and Hong Kong would likely be focused on Singapore and Australia. The Company has not been able to expand operations as planned and as of the date of this Amendment Two due, in part, to lack of adequate funding and identification of an appropriate expansion opportunity – although the Company secured a revolving credit loan for growth and working capital in July 2022. If expansion of operations does occur, then the Company’s intent and plan is to own the voting equity securities of new operating subsidiaries and not to employ a VIE or any similar structure.

Certain Legal and Other Issues resulting from the Company being a U.S. Public Holding Company with Chinese and Hong Kong based Operating Subsidiaries. The Company’s corporate structure presents unique risks as Company’s investors may never be able to directly hold equity interests in Company’s operating subsidiaries and Company will be dependent upon outside investment or loans, dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries to finance Company’s limited cash flow needs. Company’s ability to receive dividends and other contributions from the Company’s operating subsidiaries could be significantly affected in the future by laws and regulations promulgated by, or other actions taken by, the Hong Kong or Chinese authorities. Any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules and regulations may materially affect our operations and or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless or illiquid. For a description of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China and Hong Kong” below at page 16 and further description of Chinese laws and regulation in this Item 1 Business.
 
Currently, Chinese and Hong Kong laws and regulations do not prohibit direct foreign investment in our Hong Kong operating subsidiaries. Nonetheless, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the Chinese government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security and related data transfers, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which requirements are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, Company and its operating subsidiaries are subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the Chinese government in this regard, which future actions may likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments or permit direct equity ownership in Company’s operating subsidiaries, and offer or continue to offer securities to U.S. investors, and the resulting adverse change in value to our common stock. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the Chinese regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or “CSRC”, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the OTCQB, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
 
In the past, the Company has operated and relied upon Hong Kong as a “separate system” from China – meaning that Hong Kong, as was true when it was a United Kingdom possession, would continue to operate under a legal, regulatory and economic system that was pro-capitalist and accommodating to foreign companies and foreign investment rather than under a state-controlled, socialist system like China. Under the agreement whereby the United Kingdom relinquished control over Hong Kong to China, China agreed to allow the continuation of this “separate system” until 2050. Actions in the past two years have shown that Chinese government has decided to assert direct control over some aspects of Hong Kong’s legal, regulatory and economic affairs and thereby erode or possibly end the “separate system.” The Chinese government could arbitrarily adopt or make changes in laws, regulations or policies that would effectively make a continuation of the current Company’s structure and operations impossible or impractical and force the Company into significant corporate transactions that could render an investment in the Company’s securities potentially worthless or illiquid. The Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries have been able to conduct their business and financial operations as before Chinese government intervention in Hong Kong affairs started in the past two years, but the Company can make no assurances that this status quo in business and financial operations will continue through 2022 or beyond due to the risks and uncertainties created by recent Chinese government actions and the ability and increasing willingness of the Chinese government to impose its will with little or no prior notice, and with no effective recourse by affected persons and businesses, Hong Kong and, despite some economic liberalization in past years, in China.
 
The laws and regulations in the China are evolving, and their enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation involve significant uncertainties. The evolution of Chinese laws and increasing Chinese government control over Hong Kong creates an uncertain situation for the Company, its corporate structure and status as a U.S. holding company and the quotation and trading of Company’s Common Stock in the United States. To the extent any Chinese laws and regulations become applicable to the Company, the Company may be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the legal system in China, including with respect to the enforcement of laws and the possibility of changes of rules and regulations with little or no advance notice, and from Chinese government increasingly and unilaterally causing changes to Hong Kong laws and regulation with little or no advance notice. For instance, under recent changes to Chinese laws described in “Chinese Securities/Investment Regulation and Laws” in this Item 1. Business at page 10 below, foreign ownership in our Chinese subsidiaries is possible or, at least, more possible than in the past, but foreign ownership of Chinese-incorporated companies remains subject to evolving and complex laws with uncertain application by Chinese government authorities. Further, there can be no assurance that the Chinese government would approve any continuation of Company’s current corporate structure, status as a U.S. public holding company, or ability to trade its securities or maintain its OTCQB listing of its Common Stock under the evolving, uncertain regulatory environment or any future regulatory environment. The Chinese government could dramatically change any laws, regulations or policies that are currently favorable to the Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries with no or little notice and in a manner that is significantly adverse to the Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong.

Certain Chinese and Hong Kong Laws and Regulations. 
 
Background – Hong Kong as a Separate System and Recent Chinese Government Actions affecting Hong Kong’s Separate System Status. Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on July 1, 1997, by virtue of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law transferring Hong Kong to Chinese oversight (“Basic Law”). Under that arrangement, the concept of “one country, two systems” was accepted by China, which meant that Hong Kong would retain its political, economic, and judicial systems for 50 years after reversion. Under this agreement of a “separate system”, Hong Kong was allowed and has generally pursued a ‘free market’, pro-capitalist philosophy with minimal Chinese government intervention in order to preserve Hong Kong’s status as an attractive international business and financial center. Under the separate system: (1) Hong Kong government generally welcomed foreign investment, neither offering special incentives nor imposing disincentives for foreign investors; (2) Hong Kong generally provided no distinction in law or practice between investments by foreign-controlled companies and those controlled by local interests; and (3) Foreign firms and individuals are able to incorporate their operations in Hong Kong, register branches of foreign operations, and set up representative offices without encountering discrimination or undue regulation and without undue restrictions on the ownership of those operations.  Further, Company directors were not required to be citizens of, or resident in, Hong Kong.  Reporting requirements were straightforward and not onerous. In short, Hong Kong operated as a “capitalist” oasis within Chinese socialist, central-state controlled realm.
 
The U.S. State Department stated in its 2022 Hong Kong Policy Report: “Hong Kong continued to exercise authority in the implementation of commercial agreements and practiced free and open trade, with negligible tariff or non-tariff barriers. The Hong Kong legal system continued to be based on common-law traditions.  The imposition of the NSL and pressure from the PRC did, however, raise serious concerns about the judicial system’s continued independence.  Property rights were well-protected in law and practice.  Hong Kong maintained its own currency, pegged to the U.S. dollar.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority set monetary policy autonomously from the People’s Bank of China. Hong Kong sets its own data regulations and does not have any broad data localization requirements.  Under mainland China’s cross-border data transfer requirements, Hong Kong is considered outside of China and is treated the same as foreign jurisdictions.”
 
Nonetheless, since 2020, the Chinese government has adopted certain laws, regulations and policies and taken certain regulatory and other actions that have significantly eroded Hong Kong’s “separate system” status and created significant risks and uncertainties about Hong Kong remaining a “capitalist oasis”, especially for U.S. companies like the Company, relatively autonomous from Chinese government direct control and intervention and the adverse effects of ongoing and growing political, international and military tensions between China and the United States. Tensions between China and United States have, in part, been manifested by retaliatory and punitive legislative, regulatory and policies by each nation. While the United States regards such actions by the United States as protecting or ensuring transparency and integrity in business, financial and commercial activities, China regards United States regulatory actions as an improper intrusion in Chinese internal affairs and attack on Chinese sovereignty.
 
The Chinese National People’s Congress Standing Committee (“NPCSC”) also passed a decision imposing sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system that blocked the participation of political groups not approved by Chinese government and greatly diminished Hong Kong voters’ ability to elect representatives of their choice.

Background - Chinese Legal System. China is a socialist state with the central government exercising unfettered power. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Further, Chinese legislative system does not include the same kind of legislative review and approval process of U.S. legislative system and, as such, significant changes in laws or regulation may be imposed in China by the Chinese government without the extensive notice of possible changes in laws or regulations afforded by, and the ability to influence the legislative process and regulation afforded by, the U.S. system. Since many of the Chinese laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve in response to Chinese economic growth and evolution into a less socialist system in economics, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and policies are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and policies involves uncertainties – principally, about the scope or extent of application and about unexpected changes in the application of those laws, regulations and policies imposed by a powerful central government. From time to time, the Company or its Chinese subsidiaries may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce their respective legal rights. However, since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection a company enjoys than in more developed regulatory capitalist systems. Furthermore, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules that the central Chinese government has the power to unilaterally to change and to do so with little or no notice and with little or no ability by affected companies and persons to influence or prevent, As a result, and with increasing Chinese government control over Hong Kong, the Company and its Chinese and Hong Kong subsidiaries may not be able to keep in compliance with these laws, regulations and policies, and changes thereto, in time to adjust or make arrangements to counter or accommodate any adverse impact of Chinese government mandates or changes in laws, regulations and policies. These uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of Company’s and Chinese operating subsidiaries’ contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect the business and impede the ability to continue Company’s Chinese and Hong Kong operations.
 
As of the date of filing of this Amendment Two, the Company and its Chinese and Hong Kong subsidiaries have been able to continue to operate under the current corporate structure and have not experienced any direct, significant adverse impact of increasing Chinese government influence or control over Hong Kong or enforcement of Chinese laws in China. There can be no assurances that the status quo will continue through 2022 or beyond.
 
Chinese and Hong Kong Business Permits and Regulation. Company’s legal counsel as to Chinese and Hong Kong laws has advised the Company that: (1) the laws and regulations of China do not currently have any material impact on Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations and (2) Company is not currently required to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) or any other regulatory authority in the China for Company or subsidiary operations (other than usual and customary business permits), for the trading of our securities on the OTCQB and the issuance of Company securities to foreign investors.
 
As a general business legal requirement, Company’s Chinese subsidiaries are required to obtain a business license from the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”). Each of our Chinese subsidiaries has obtained a valid business license from the SAMR, and no application for any such license has been denied. Further, to operate our general business activities currently conducted in China, our relevant Chinese subsidiaries may also be required to obtain other permits from the Chinese government. Company’s Chinese subsidiaries have obtained the necessary permits applicable to them and no application for such permits has been denied by authorities. Our Hong Kong and Philippines subsidiaries likewise have all local government permits to operate their respective businesses.
 
Certain Chinese Laws and Government Actions.
 
Chinese National Security Law. Hong Kong’s ‘separate system’ was significantly altered with the application of the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (known as the “National Security Law” or “NSL”) in Hong Kong on June 30, 2020. On May 28, 2020, the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China approved a proposal to impose a new national security law for Hong Kong and authorized the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress to proceed to work out details of the legislation to be implemented in Hong Kong (the “Decision”). The Decision states that the new law will target secession, subversion of state power, terrorism activities and foreign interference and do so without certain, defined limits on the regulatory power or scope. The stated objective of the Decision is to protect the national security of China as a whole (including Hong Kong and Macau) and is purportedly not intended to have a direct commercial bearing on commercial and economic activities. On June 30, 2020, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed the National Security Law for the Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive promulgated it in Hong Kong later the same day. Among other things, it criminalizes separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. Further, China may enforce the NSL in Hong Kong and can prosecute companies and persons in Chinese courts, not Hong Kong courts. We cannot rule out the possibility that the Decision and the implementation of the NSL may not be applied to the Company and its operating subsidiaries in a detrimental, unanticipated manner or that NSL may not trigger retaliatory sanctions or other forms of penalties by foreign governments, which may cause economic and other hardship for Hong Kong, including companies like us that do business in Hong Kong. It is difficult for us to predict the impact, if any, the implementation of the NSL will have on our business, as such impact will depend on future developments and clarification of scope of regulation and enforcement, which are all highly uncertain and cannot be predicted - due in part on the ability of the Chinese government to arbitrarily impose its will on Hong Kong legal, regulatory and economic affairs.

Chinese Data Laws. Chinese Legal Developments for Data Security. On June 10, 2021, China promulgated the PRC Data Security Law (“DSL”), which became effective on September 1, 2021. The legislative intent for this law mainly includes regulating data processing activities, ensuring data security, promoting data development and utilization, protecting the data related legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations, and safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests. Article 36 provides that any Chinese entity that provides the regulated data to foreign judicial or law enforcement agencies (regardless of whether directly or through a foreign entity) without approval from the Chinese authority would likely be deemed to be in violation of DSL. Further, Article 2 of Measures for Cybersecurity Reviews, the procurement of any network product or service by an operator of critical information infrastructure that affects or may affect national security shall be subjected to a cybersecurity review under the Article 2 Measures. Pursuant to Article 35 of Cybersecurity Law of the China, where “critical information infrastructure operators” purchase network products and services, which may influence national security, the operators are required to be subjected to a cybersecurity review by Chinese regulators.
 
The Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries do not operate any known critical information infrastructure. As a result, the Company does not believe that these new legal requirements in China are applicable to the Company or its operating subsidiaries. Since the exact scope of the term “critical information infrastructure operator” and the scope of regulated data subject to the DSL remains unclear and not settled by guidance from the Chinese government, and since the Company provides information technology services to customers in the commercial transaction realm, and since the DSL applies to data processing activities in China and to data processing activities outside China (including Hong Kong) that impact Chinese national security, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries will not be subjected to critical information infrastructure operator review in the future by Chinese government or Hong Kong government. Furthermore, in the event that the Company as a parent company or any of its operating subsidiaries are deemed to be an operator of critical information infrastructure in the future by the Chinese government, the Company and one or more of its operating subsidiaries may be subjected to the above-described regulation and restrictions on business imposed by that regulation. Any such regulation could impose significant regulatory burdens and compliance costs on the Company’s operating subsidiaries in China and potentially in Hong Kong and, as small business operators, that regulation and compliance cost could significantly, adversely impact the financial performance of the Company’s operating subsidiaries and, thereby the Company’s financial performance, and could force the Company or one or more of the Company operating subsidiaries to cease or curtail or limit any involvement in regulated data processing activities. Such changes in operations would be detrimental to the financial performance of the Company’s affected operating subsidiaries and their ability to grow in their primary business lines.
 
Based on guidance from Hong Kong legal counsel to the Company, the Company and its operations are not currently subject to or materially impacted by the Chinese cybersecurity-data laws described in this Chinese Data Laws. Chinese Legal Developments for Data Security.
 
Chinese Securities/Investment Regulation and Laws. Chinese Foreign Investment Law ("FIL"), as well as its Implementing Regulations ("Implementing Regulations"), took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition to the FIL and the Implementing Regulations, the 2019 Special Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment (also known as the "FIL Negative List") and the Catalogue of Encouraged Industries for Foreign Investment ("Encouraged Industries Catalogue") took effect on July 30, 2019 (collectively, the "New Law"). The FIL, as a single unified body of law has, as of January 1, 2020, replaced the three previous laws governing foreign investment and foreign invested enterprises ("FIEs") in China, and on paper provides for greater promotion and protection of foreign investment as well as purported enhanced regulatory transparency. The revised FIL Negative List has further liberalized certain Chinese market sectors and reduced restrictions, and the Encouraged Industries Catalogue identifies more key industries (such as manufacturing, technology, and agriculture) in which China further encourages foreign investment with preferential policies. Prior to the FIL, foreign investors, including U.S. investors, who have been operating in China for decades, have faced certain hurdles on business establishment and investment treatment (compared with their Chinese counterparts), and have been restricted from investing in certain sectors unless in a joint venture with a Chinese party. Further, foreign investors have needed to navigate through the Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Law, the Chinese-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law, which imposed specific requirements on corporate formation, foreign ownership ratios, corporate governance and operational management. In addition, insufficient protection of intellectual property rights and trade significant concerns for many foreign investors. The FIL Negative List and Encouraged Industries Catalogue perform the functions of prohibiting and restricting foreign investment in certain sectors, and providing incentives for foreign investment in other fields. While the overall impact of the FIL is to facilitate foreign investment in Chinese companies, if foreign investors invest in prohibited industries or fail to comply with investment access restrictions, they will be required to divest or rectify their non-compliance, and may face other sanctions under the FIL and other Chinese laws. The FIL also allows for certain counter-measures to be imposed in response to prohibitive or restrictive rules against China from other countries. As such, the New Law is another example of evolving Chinese regulatory system that has the potential for significant, unanticipated and potentially detrimental regulation on companies and persons, especially U.S. public holding companies with Chinese or Hong operations – like the Company.

As a further development in Chinese regulatory evolution, on July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China jointly issued “Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities in accordance with the Law” (“Opinions”) signaling that the country will step up its supervision of domestic firms listed both onshore and offshore. The Opinions purportedly intend to improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading. Additionally, China will check sources of funding for securities investment and control leverage ratios. This follows an action in early 2019, when amendments were made to the Securities Law of the People's Republic of China that included penalizing overseas capital-markets activities that hurt investors in China. These government actions are supposedly an attempt to close the loophole that allowed Chinese tech companies to list overseas without the same scrutiny as would apply in a domestic listing process. Chinese internet companies typically adopt the variable interest entity structure that gives them flexibility to raise funds offshore and this evolving Chinese regulation of securities listings overseas is an effort to subject foreign overseas securities offerings and listing by Chinese companies to a domestic regulatory review.
 
The CSRC is currently drafting rules that could require offshore registered Chinese companies to seek regulatory approval before selling shares in foreign markets, with the Cyberspace Administration of China or “CAC” leading interagency scrutiny into initial public offering or “IPO” candidates to make sure their plans don’t risk national security. Further, the CAC proposed amending its draft cybersecurity-review rules to require internet companies with more than one million users to undergo a cybersecurity review if they are looking to list abroad. The Company and its operating subsidiaries are not internet companies for purposes of the laws and regulations described in in this Chinese Securities/Investment Regulation and Laws, but there can be no assurances of future changes in law, regulation or simply enforcement that does not expand these laws or regulations to activities vital to impact the Company and its operating subsidiaries.
 
The Company and its operating subsidiaries have not been impacted by these securities-related regulatory developments in China as of the date of the filing of this Amendment Two, but due evolving and uncertain nature of the actual implementation and future scope of Chinese regulation of overseas listing and trading of securities of domestic Chinese companies, the lack of certainty about the scope and enforcement of these securities-related legal and regulatory developments, as well as the ability of the Chinese government to impose or change laws, regulations and policies in Hong Kong, it is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the Chinese government for our current quotation on the OTCQB or any future application to have our securities list on a U.S. stock exchange, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any Chinese or Hong Kong regulatory authorities and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry. As a result, our common stock may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless or illiquid should we become subject to new requirement to obtain permission from the Chinese government to list on U.S. exchange in the future.

Chinese Currency Controls. The Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB, the Chinese currency, into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Company’s Chinese operating subsidiaries receive their revenues in RMB. Under existing Chinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements, including: When conducting outward remittance of a sum equivalent to more than $50,000 for a domestic institution, the bank involved shall, under the principle of genuine transaction, check the profit distribution resolution made by the board of directors (or profit distribution resolution made by partners), original of tax filing form and audited financial statements, and stamp with the outward remittance sum and date on the original of tax filing form. In addition, the company shall make up its losses of previous years according to law. The transaction must be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. Chinese subsidiaries should be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to the Company without prior approval from SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the China complies with certain procedures under Chinese foreign exchange regulation, such as the overseas investment registrations by the beneficial owners of our company who are Chinese residents. But approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Company secured a revolving credit loan from a Texas bank in July 2022 and sums loaned under that revolving credit loan will have to be paid in U.S. Dollars. The Company does not believe that these restrictions will prevent use of payments from its Chinese subsidiaries to repay any sums due under the revolving credit loan. However, the Chinese government may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions by Chinese based companies.
Philippines Laws and Regulations - Manila, Philippines Operating Subsidiary. The Company’s operating subsidiary in Manila, Philippines, TAP Services, Inc., is operating under a legal and regulatory system that does not present the same level of uncertainty and risks as experienced by Company’s Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries. While the Philippines has experienced political unrest and challenges to its democratic form of government, the Company’s Manila operating subsidiary has not been adversely impacted by the political turmoil in the Philippines. The Philippines is a multi-party, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature and has a U.S. style judicial system, which are each similar to the United States political and judicial systems. United States and Philippines have strong economic, military, cultural and government relations. While the national government in the Philippines can act in an arbitrary manner, especially in human rights matters, the Company and Company’s operating subsidiary in Manila, Philippines have not experienced the uncertainties and perceived risks observed in China and Hong Kong.
U.S. Laws: The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”)
 
As more stringent criteria has been imposed by the SEC and the PCAOB in 2021 and 2022 on companies with foreign public auditors, and under the HFCAA, Company’s securities may be prohibited from being traded on the over-the-counter (the “OTC”) markets or from being listed on U.S. national securities exchanges if Company’s current public auditor is not able to be fully audited and inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive fiscal years, and this ultimately could result in trading in Company securities being prohibited in United States and delisted from OTCQB in early 2024.
 
The HFCAA was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCA Act states that if the SEC determines that a public company’s audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm has not been subject to full audit and inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, due to foreign government policies or position, the SEC shall prohibit that public company’s securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States after the third consecutive fiscal year.
 
On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to Exchange Act registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a policy or position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions, like China (including Hong Kong).

--


On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (i) China and (ii) Hong Kong. Our auditor, Zhen Hui, CPA, is an independent registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB and has been identified by the PCAOB as a public auditor located in Hong Kong that cannot be fully audited or inspected due to Chinese government policies. The Company has been identified as a “Commission Identified Issuer” by the SEC under HFCAA rules issued by SEC, which means our public auditor cannot be fully audited and inspected by PCAOB because of Chinese government policies. Company’s Common Stock will be delisted or removed from quotation on OTCQB in early 2024 and not allowed to trade on U.S. national securities markets if Company has a public auditor who cannot be fully inspected or audited by PCAOB and writes the auditor report for fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023.
 
Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted into law, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges or the OTC markets if its public auditor is not subject to full audit and investigation by PCAOB for two consecutive years instead of three - thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or being delisted. As of September 12, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (H.R. 6285 — 117th Congress) has not been approved in an identical form by both houses of Congress, which is required for transmission to the U.S. President for signing and enactment into law. It is uncertain if this legislation will become law, but since there is the possibility of the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act becoming law, especially considering current Chinese-U.S. relations and the impact of those relations on legislation, the risks and uncertainties of the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act remain pertinent and present and, if enacted into law, would require the Company to have a public auditor for its annual audits that can be fully audited and inspected by PCAOB for the Company’s 2022 annual audit, instead of the Company’s 2023 annual audit, to avoid having its Common Stock delisted from OTCQB in 2023 and the Company being unable to list its securities on a U.S. national securities exchange.
 
Potential Compromise by PCAOB and China on HFCAA. On August 26, 2022, the SEC issued a Statement on Agreement Governing Inspections and Investigations of Audit Firms Based in China and Hong Kong (“August 26, 2022 Compromise”). Under the August 26, 2022 Compromise, the PCAOB, China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), and Ministry of Finance of People’s Republic of China established a framework allowing the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. This framework potentially prevents the possible delisting of approximately 200 China-based issuers from the U.S. stock exchanges pursuant to the HFCAA, including the Company. However, it is not certain that the implementation of the August 26, 2022 Compromise will in fact result in public auditors in China and Hong Kong being able to be fully audited and inspected by PCAOB to the extent that the risk and threat of delisting of U.S. traded securities of Commission Identified Issuers, like the Company, under the HFCAA will be eliminated by virtue of the August 26, 2022 Compromise. Since the August 26, 2022 Compromise has not conclusively changed the risks and uncertainties faced by the Company under the HFCAA as of the date of the filing of this Amendment Two, the Company continues to face the risk and uncertainties under the HFCAA. As such, the Company is continuing with its planning to avoid delisting under the HFCAA by seeking new possible public auditors not subject to HFCAA and its rules.
 
If the August 26, 2022 Compromise ends the threat of delisting due to the current public auditor being removed from the PCAOB list of Chinese auditors that cannot be fully investigated and audited by PCAOB and does so before the 2023 annual audit, and if Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act becomes law and it does not prevent the August 26, 2022 Compromise from removing the risks and uncertainties for the Company under the HFCAA, then the Company may consider retaining its current public auditor. Nonetheless, Company intends to take necessary actions to prevent the delisting of its Common Stock from OTCQB under the HFCAA and its rules. The Company has not engaged a new auditor as of the date of the filing of this Amendment Two who can be fully inspected and audited by the PCAOB due to foreign government policy. See: (1) “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China and Hong Kong — Under the HFCA Act, our securities may be prohibited from being quoted and traded on any U.S. securities exchange or through any other trading method within the SEC’s regulatory jurisdiction, including the OTC markets if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in trading in our securities being prohibited. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges or the OTC markets if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.” on page 25 below; and (2) Item 9C Disclosure regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections on page 29.

The HFCAA and Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act are examples of U.S. legislation imposing regulatory burdens, risks and uncertainties on companies based in China or Hong Kong, including U.S. holding companies based in Hong Kong (like the Company) or China. As part of an effort to foster greater transparency and integrity, as well as possibly in response to political, economic or miliary competition and tensions between the United States and China, especially over the disputed independence of Taiwan and U.S. support of Taiwan independence, the U.S Congress may pass and U.S. President may sign new laws that create further regulatory burdens, risks and uncertainties on the Company and its continued operation as a U.S. holding company with Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries and the Company securities continued to be quoted and traded in the United States. Further, the U.S. President may take executive actions posing the same risks and uncertainties for the Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries.
 
The U.S. government, including the SEC, has recently made statements and taken certain actions that may lead to significant changes to U.S. and international relations, and will impact companies with connections to the United States or China (including Hong Kong). The SEC has issued statements primarily focused on companies with significant China-based operations. For example, on July 30, 2021, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, issued a Statement on Investor Protection Related to Recent Developments in China, pursuant to which Chairman Gensler stated that he has asked the SEC staff to engage in targeted additional reviews of filings for companies with significant China-based operations. The new level of regulatory scrutiny on Chinese-based companies is reflected in the SEC’s issuance of Sample Letter to China-Based Companies with special disclosure concerns and guidance for Chinese based companies. The Company may be subject to additional regulation and regulatory burdens as a result of its presence in Hong Kong and ownership of Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries. These additional burdens may increase operating overhead, reduce gross revenues, and result in enforcement and litigation that adversely impacts the financial condition of, and investor support for and confidence in, the Company. 
 
Russian Ukraine War; Taiwan. The Company and its operating subsidiaries have no offices, operations, customers, business partners, personnel or transactions in Russia, Ukraine or any adjacent nations. As of the date of the filing of this Amendment Two, the Company and its operating subsidiaries have not been adversely impacted by the Russian-Ukrainian war, or cybersecurity threats from Russia or Ukraine, or business disruption of commerce caused by Russian-Ukrainian war, or the response of United States and Europe to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. As a small business information technology service provider to local businesses, and with no operations in in the United States or non-Asia regions, our operations are not significantly impacted by global supply chain disruptions and sanctions against Russia by the U.S. or European Union, or related energy shortages and disruptions.
 
Except as noted below, the Company does not know of any trends or uncertainties that have, had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on Company’s or its subsidiaries’ cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, cash requirements, financial position, or results of operations arising from, related to, or caused by the global disruption from, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting war, including uncertainties that may include impairments of financial assets or long-lived assets; declines in the value of investments, or recoverability of deferred tax assets; the collectability of consideration related to contracts with customers; and modification of contracts with customers.
 
The continuation or spread of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially if the United States and China were to become more deeply involved in the conflict and such involvement heightens United States-Chinese tensions, could result in a downturn in the global economy, which may: (1) negatively impact the economies of China, Hong Kong and Philippines and thereby potentially reduce customer demand for services of the Company’s operating subsidiaries; and (2) result in increased conflict and animosity between United States and China and one or both nations adopting retaliatory laws and policies that negatively affect the ability of the Company to remain a U.S. public holding company able to receive investment or funding from non-Chinese, non-Hong Kong sources and able to continue to have its shares of Common Stock quoted on the OTC or any other U.S. securities exchange or national quotation system.

Further, the ongoing threat of Chinese military action against Taiwan, or any actual Chinese military action against Taiwan, whether encouraged by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict or not, causes ongoing and potentially heightened uncertainties and risks to the Company’s U.S public holding company status as well as U.S. or European investors’ confidence in the Company and its securities. Any United States response to any Chinese military action against Taiwan, and any Chinese response to United States’ response, could include legislation, regulations or other actions that make the current corporate structure of the Company and its status as a U.S. public holding company with Chinese and Hong Kong operations untenable or impossible.
 
China’s position has been that Taiwan is part of China and China does not recognize Taiwanese independence. U.S. support of Taiwan on any level or manner is viewed by Chinese government as an improper intrusion by the United States in Chinese internal affairs and a challenge to Chinese sovereignty.
 
While U.S. does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the United States maintains extensive informal diplomatic, political, military and economic relations with Taiwan. Under the Taiwan Relations Act and related diplomatic communiques, the U.S. opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo by China; does not ‘actively’ support Taiwan independence and expects any Chinese-Taiwanese cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means.  Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States makes available defense articles and services as necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability and U.S. maintains our capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of Taiwan. Whether the United States would use its military to protect Taiwan from Chinese invasion is uncertain, but the United States has demonstrated and projected its military might in and around Taiwan when Chinese actions constitute a military challenge to Taiwanese independence. Due to the importance of Taiwan to the U.S. economy, especially in terms of semiconductor supplies and technology cooperation and contributions, there is a perceived probability that the United States would assert some level of U.S. military support to counter any Chinese military action against Taiwan.
 
Besides the conflict and tensions between China and United States over Taiwan, the two nation’s competition and conflicts as economic, international relations and military rivals in East Asia creates the possibility of retaliatory laws, regulations or policies by one or both nations and possibly significant, adverse impact on the Company and Company’s operating subsidiaries and Company’s shareholders.
 
Environmental Matters. In 2020, China's President Xi Jinping said his country would aim for its climate change emissions to reach their highest point before 2030 and for carbon neutrality before 2060. However, China has been vague on how it will achieve these goals and China continues to emphasize economic growth over controlling climate control. It is unclear if China will be able to control carbon emissions and curtail impact of climate change on China and its economy.
 
Parts of China, mostly southern and southwest China, have experienced power outages in August 2022 due to severe, protracted droughts affecting hydroelectrical output. The power outages are mostly in Sichuan Province in south central China. As of the date of the filing of this Amendment Two, the Company and its Chinese and Hong Kong operations have not been adversely impacted by these power outages. The Company’s and its Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries’ operations and customer bases are mostly in Eastern China. The spread of drought conditions in China or continuation of existing drought conditions in China could negatively affect overall economic conditions in China by reducing power to factories and causing a resulting decline in industrial output, which in turn could cause a downturn in economic performance of China and Hong Kong and, consequently, possibly reduce customer demand for services of the Company’s Chinese and Hong Kong subsidiaries.
 
Hong Kong has been importing significant levels of nuclear electricity from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in Guangdong, China since 1994, as well as supplementing energy needs by coal generation facilities. Hong Kong has adopted a green energy policy that is reducing reliance on coal imported from other nations and increasing energy efficiencies by businesses and residents. Due to high population density of Hong Kong and large percentage of the population living and working in high rinse buildings, adequate and reliable electrical power is important to business and economic activity. In 2021, the Government announced Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, which outlined four major decarbonisation strategies, namely “net-zero electricity generation”, “energy saving and green buildings”, “green transport” and “waste reduction”, that would lead Hong Kong towards the goal of carbon neutrality before 2050. It also sets out a more vigorous interim decarbonisation targets to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by 50% before 2035 as compared to the 2005 level. Two thirds of carbon emissions in Hong Kong come from coal based generation of electricity. The Hong Kong government has set a goal of ending use of coal for electricity generation by 2035. There can be no certainty that either China or Hong Kong will be able to combat the adverse and increasingly severe impact of climate change on China or Hong Kong, even if they both timely achieve climate change emission goals.

The increasing impact of climate change in China and rest of Asia and the unpredictability of the severity and timing of that impact creates substantial uncertainty and risks potentially impacting the Company and its subsidiaries, especially the impact on power supply to business operations and general economic conditions. A continuation or geographical expansion of severe drought in China could reduce the ability of China to provide adequate or ongoing electrical power for businesses in China. In 2021 and 2022, China has experienced power outages and regulatory efforts to control electrical consumption in industrial centers of China, including Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian and Yunnan due to cost of coal, a major fuel for electrical generation, impact of drought on hydroelectrical power generation and increasing temperatures increasing businesses’ and individuals’ demand for electrical power for air conditioning. Climate change has and will continue to impact general economic conditions and thereby potentially decrease customer use or demand for our services.
 
While the Company’s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant, direct adverse impact on business operations from current climate change problems experienced by China and Hong Kong, climate change represents a significant, increasing and ongoing source of significant uncertainties and risks potentially affecting all companies in numerous industries in China and Hong Kong.
 
Strategic Planning. As part of its strategic planning, the Company’s management is evaluating possible options in response to a situation where the continuation of the Company operating as a U.S. public holding company with Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries becomes impractical or not possible. The Company is not pursuing those options as of the filing of this Amendment Two and its review is merely contingency planning. Possible responses to an inability to continue operating as a U.S. public holding company with Chinese and Hong Kong operating subsidiaries include reincorporation to a non-U.S. jurisdiction by the Company, an acquisition or merger involving the Company or Company’s operating subsidiaries, asset sales, or liquidation. There is no assurance that the Company could consummate any such transaction or transactions or, if the Company did effect any of those transactions that: the Company would remain a U.S. public holding company with its securities quoted on the OTCQB or listed on a U.S. national securities exchange; the Company’s Common Stock would be liquid or retain any value; or the Company’s shareholders would receive any securities or cash, or other return on investment in the Company; or the Company would be able to have or accept investments from U.S. investors.
