Overview of Business
 
We have developed a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics and news for stock and options traders of all levels combined with a social media element and educational materials. Our web-based software (the “Blackbox System”) employs “predictive technology” enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that may result in the rapid change in the price of a stock or option. We continuously scan the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), NASDAQ, Chicago Board Options Exchange (the “CBOE”) and other options markets, analyzing over 10,000 stocks and over 1,500,000 options contracts multiple times per second. We provide our subscribing members with a fully interactive social media platform that is integrated into our dashboard, enabling our members to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently through a common network. We believe the Blackbox System’s combination of proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media connecting traders of all types worldwide on an intuitive, user-friendly system is a unique and disruptive financial technology platform.
 
We employ a subscription-based Software as a Service (“SaaS”) business model and maintain a growing base of members that spans 42 countries. We currently offer monthly subscriptions to our platform for $99 per month and annual subscriptions for $959 per year.
 
Our goal is to provide retail investors with the type of sophisticated trading tools that were previously available only to large institutional hedge funds and high-frequency traders together with an interactive community of traders and investors of all levels at an affordable price. We also strive to provide these trading tools in a user-friendly format that does not require complicated configurations by the user. All of our software is web-based and does not require downloads or frequent updates.

Our Mission 
 
Our mission is to provide useful proprietary analytics in a simple and concise format to level the playing field for the average retail investor. We strive to educate our members both within our live trading community and in our scheduled, calendared classes with live instructors. We want every member to feel they are part of a team with the goal of attaining financial literacy. We believe that we are the antithesis of the “trading guru” platforms that feature a trading or investing expert that charges for what are often expensive courses. We do not charge for our classes. We do not upsell our members. All education and community programs are free with the subscription to our platform.
Revenue Model
 
We generate revenue from a software as a service (or SaaS) model whereby members pay either an annual or monthly fee for a subscription to our platform. We do not currently offer more than one level of subscription with varying levels of features. All members have full access to all of the features on our platform.
 
Monthly subscriptions are currently priced at $99 and annual subscriptions are currently priced at $959 (a discount of $241). We occasionally offer gift cards and promotional discounts on our annual subscriptions.
 
Development of the Blackbox System
 
The Blackbox System was made available for use to subscribing customers worldwide in September 2016. We use a web-based platform focused on providing proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media for our community of members. Our product offering is comprised of three key elements: trading analytics, social media interaction and educational programs and resources.
 


Trading Analytics 
 
Our preconfigured dashboard is designed to be simple and easy to navigate and includes real-time alerts, stock and options scanners, financial news, institutional grade charting, and our proprietary analytics that can be utilized by traders of all levels. Our Blackbox System populates the stock and option data in real time and provides a wide range analytics and tools for traders. We offer many of the standard market tool features used by traders but differentiate our product with an array of unique proprietary features and derived data. These proprietary features are designed to filter out “market noise” and locate the relevant market movers in the stock or option category in real-time.

In December 2017, we launched our first Options Flow Scanner as a new feature on our platform. Our Options Flow Scanner is designed to monitor and alert our members to unusual activity on the options exchanges. We have created a proprietary options alert system and a proprietary options “heatmap” to allow our members to follow large options purchases in real-time. The heatmap provides our members with a color-coded chart indicating bullish or bearish activity of a security’s option contracts sorted by strike price and expiration date that quickly identifies which direction money is flowing. This has proven to be a very popular feature for our members. We also added a Dark Pool Scanner in 2020. The Dark Pool Scanner monitors, tracks, charts and displays large blocks of stock that are often purchased in dark pools and as a result these orders are not displayed on regular exchanges.
 
Brokerage Integrations 
 
We have trading integrations with the online brokerages E*Trade and TradeStation. These integrations allow our members to execute trades through E*Trade orTradeStation directly from the Blackbox platform. Our members that use this integration feature have access to certain custom tools. One of these tools is a “quick-click” feature that loads our system’s stock and options alerts with two simple clicks, greatly reducing the time it takes for order entry. This feature is especially helpful for the order entry of option contracts, as they are detailed, lengthy, and cumbersome to enter. We intend to expand the number of brokerages with whom we have trading integrations in the future.

Education 
 
We offer all members full access to our curriculum of classes, orientations, and live market sessions. These education programs are all free to our members with either monthly or annual subscriptions. Our curriculum includes classes for beginners, intermediate level, as well as advanced traders. We believe education is vital to increasing the probability of our members long term success in the markets. We have many regularly calendared live webinars, Q&A sessions, as well as recorded classes. In addition to our regularly calendared classes, we often feature ad hoc classes taught by seasoned members of our community. The educators of these classes often specialize in specific market sectors or trading strategies. Classes and webinar events offered to our members include but are not limited to:

● | Trading with Charlie and Maria (Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays 9:15am – 10:30am EST)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Blackbox Orientation (Monday 5:00pm – 7:00pm EST)
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Tuesday and Thursday Q&A (Tuesdays/Thursdays 4:00pm – 5:00pm EST)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Blackbox Bootcamp Part I ~Basics of Stocks and Options (Twice Weekly)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Dark Pool Basics (Thursdays 5:00pm – 6:00pm EST)
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our internal curriculum, we have partnered with the Options Industry Council (OIC), a nonprofit organization funded by the OCC with the mission of providing the investing public a better understanding of the options markets. Classes taught by the OIC to our members include but are not limited to:
 

● | The Greeks Part I
--+------------------


● | The Greeks Part II
--+-------------------


● | Implied Volatility
--+-------------------


● | Short Term Options Explained
--+-----------------------------


● | Options Pricing Explained
--+--------------------------

 
One of the most attractive aspects of our education program is that the classes are taught by members of our community. The student members who take these are often familiar with the instructor from following them in live trading channels on our platform. We believe this familiarity often brings an element of authenticity and heightened engagement increasing the success of these educational endeavors as well as adding to the community aspect of our platform.
 
The Blackbox Advantage 
 
A principal component to our platform is the flexibility to provide members intuitive yet powerful technical analytics that scale with user knowledge. Our preconfigured dashboard defaults to a general setting that is designed to be easy for new members to navigate. Within this same dashboard we provide a multitude of toggles and filters for more sophisticated traders to allow them to implement custom features for their more advanced trading strategies. Most importantly, our live community consisting of thousands of traders creates a real-time community curated support system whereby seasoned traders often mentor newer members. We believe this is one of the primary strengths and differentiators of our platform. Although we offer a complete curriculum of scheduled classes weekly, the live interaction amongst our members proves to be invaluable. We believe this is due to the level of excitement created when new members can watch seasoned members of the community making trades in real time and providing an accompanying narrative. In addition to the educational component, the community element of our platform harnesses a powerful dynamic that can be described as “the best of man and machine”. Our powerful algorithm technology scans the NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE and other options exchanges to find market volatility and anomalies and displays them on a common dashboard shared across the globe. With thousands of eyes on this data, our members can quickly interact and form a consensus on the trading opportunity at hand.
Our Market Opportunity 
 
The global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 created a unique environment for online companies. Further, the financial stimulus coupled with a large portion of the population confined to their homes created a freshly financed captive audience for trading tools like ours. Although our initial 2020 growth trajectory began before the pandemic and resulting lockdowns, the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to greatly increase our audience and grow our user base on a global level. In early 2021, as the lockdowns eased and people began going back to the workplace, the phenomenon commonly known as meme stock mania swept the U.S. markets. More than 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened by individuals in 2020 — more than ever in one year, according to Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. This newfound interest in the market was very positive for us as our user base grew rapidly in the first quarter of 2021. This rapid acquisition of new members also gave us valuable insight into the areas of our platform that needed significant improvement. We have implemented new technology to allow us to onboard new members and scale with less friction. We also prepared to pivot knowing that many of these recently acquired members would ultimately have to return to the workplace. We made augmenting the current broadcast features on our social media platform, as well as creating a native mobile app to send real-time push alerts, priority development initiatives. Both development initiatives are intended to cater to the trader that works during market hours and cannot stare at a screen for prolonged periods of time. The push alerts mobile and the audio broadcast on mobile allow members to stay tuned to important market developments and circumvent internet firewalls in the workplace.

It is difficult to quantify the number of people that can be classified as day traders, since the term is somewhat ambiguous, especially since there has been a large influx of self-directed investors in 2020 and 2021. The two types of traders often overlap and separating these demographics can be difficult. Recent data suggest the following size for this growing market:
 

● | 20%: One in 5 people in the U.S. invested in stocks, or mutual funds, in the final three months of 2020, up from 15% in the second quarter, a Conference Board survey showed. Harry Robertson, Business Insider, Feb 10, 2021
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 31 YEARS: The median age of user of Robinhood, one of the original commission-free online brokerages. More young adults are joining. Apex Clearing, which helps facilitate trades for brokerages, told Reuters around 1 million of new accounts it opened last year belonged to Gen Z investors, with an average age of 19. John McCrank, Reuters Jan 29, 2021
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ~$15.5 TRILLION: Total client assets at two of the top retail-focused brokerages. Fidelity Investments had $8.8 trillion in customer assets at the end of the third quarter, up from $8.3 trillion at the end of 2019. Schwab had $6.69 trillion in client assets as of Dec. 31, and 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from a year earlier. John McCrank, Reuters Jan 29, 2021
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent Technology and Development Initiatives 
 
We continually upgrade our platform to provide the best user experience and maximum value for our members. Many of the new features or improvements to our existing features are suggested by our members. Much of our platform is community curated and we take pride in collaborating with and implementing the suggestions from our members that use our system every day.
Improvement to Broadcast Enabled Social Media Component of our Platform
 
Our social media component of the Blackbox System includes chat and audio broadcast capabilities that we believe are critical to our platform. In the fourth quarter of 2021 we released a fully integrated social media component to our web platform. This update eliminates the need for dual authentication and the use of a third-party platform which was an inefficient aspect of our onboarding process. We still have access to the third-party software and allow some members to continue using it.
 
Development of Native Applications for iOS and Android
 
We currently have fully functional native applications for iOS and Android devices in development and expect to release them in April of 2022. Currently, a fully functional version of our platform is available only through our website. We introduced an initial iOS and Android application in February of 2021 offering only a push notification menu and a series of alert logs for our mobile members. Despite the limited capabilities, this new app has been a very popular feature, and extremely valuable to our userbase. This app was especially useful for the many new members that joined when they worked from home during the COVID lockdowns and recently returned to the workplace. When released, we believe that virtually every feature of our current desktop platform will be available as a native application on iOS and Android devices. We believe the addition of this fully functional native app will enable us to reach a wider customer base and improve our member engagement.

We believe that these two technological developments to the Blackbox System and platform will be major milestones for our company. Although we have experienced significant growth and received positive feedback from our members, we believe adding these new technology sets in parallel will be significant drivers of future growth.
 
New Products 
 
We intend to leverage our existing financial technology platform and data resources for the creation of new and unique products to serve our existing subscribers, as well as address a broader market. We currently have a vast array of derived data that we believe will be extremely useful to self-directed investors as well the day traders and swing traders that we currently cater to. We believe the self-directed investor demographic is significantly larger than that of day traders and swing traders and presents an enormous opportunity for our growth.
Blackbox Pro 
 
We do not currently market to persons or entities deemed by the exchanges as “professional traders.” A professional trader is generally defined by the exchanges as a person that:

● | Is registered or qualified with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, any state securities agency, any securities exchange or association, or any commodities or futures contract market or association.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Is engaged as an "investment advisor" as that term is defined in Section 201(11) of the Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 (whether or not registered or qualified under that Act).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Is employed by a bank or another organization that is exempt from registration under Federal and/or state securities laws to perform functions that would require him or her to be so registered or qualified if he or she were to perform such functions for an organization not so exempt.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The exchanges charge a substantial premium for their data to users who meet the criteria described above. In addition to the higher rates, the onboarding and subsequent approval process by these exchanges is cumbersome and not easily accomplished solely through an online process. We are currently working with our data provider and the individual exchanges to develop a streamlined digital onboarding process. We believe this will allow us to expand our reach to the "financial professional" market that we do not currently service. We believe our existing platform’s features will be well received by investment professionals once we are able to mitigate regulatory and pricing hurdles.
 
Portfolio Management Product 
 
We are currently developing a new product in the form of a mobile app for iOS and Android that will provide real-time portfolio alerts for a broad demographic of investors. Many of these alerts are a product of derived data currently generated on the Blackbox platform. This app will be designed to integrate with online brokerage platforms and allow the user to import their current stock positions and stocks on their watchlist into our app. We believe these alerts will be extremely useful for portfolio management, loss mitigation, and other investment strategies. We plan to provide extensive menu options to allow the user to customize this application to their specific needs. This will be a stand-alone product and we plan to target all self-directed retail investors, not just day traders or swing traders allowing the Company to address a much broader segment of the market. We expect to release this product in the third or fourth quarter of 2022.
Cryptocurrency Analytics Platform 
 
We are currently working on a quotation system and trading integration partnership that will allow our members to trade crypto currency through the “Blackbox Cryptos” platform. This new platform will include the same interactive social media component we provide to members of our current Blackbox platform. We expect to release this product in 2022. The overall market capitalization of crypto assets grew from less than $500 million to $782 billion between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate (or CAGR) of over 150% according to public information released by Coinbase Global, Inc. and incorporated in its SEC filings. We believe the explosive growth of this asset class combined with its technology focused investor base create a powerful opportunity for our financial technology and social media hybrid platform to provide a unique and disruptive tool to this market.

Additional Exchanges in Major Markets 
 
We plan to expand into other markets and create products similar to our Blackbox System that provide proprietary analytics for people trading on other major exchanges in the world. Exchanges we are exploring include the Indian Stock markets (BSE and NSE), Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), Brasilian BOVESPA, Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE). We are also exploring expansion into China with focus on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) and the mainland Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE).  We expect such expansion to occur in late 2022 or 2023. We believe the number of traders in China and India represent significant growth opportunities for us.
 
While all of these exchanges utilize their national language, we believe they use substantially similar technology protocols making it relatively seamless for us to replicate our system in any of these markets. Members of the Company’s management team have prior experience developing trading platforms in multiple markets, including but not limited to the LSE, Tokyo Stock Exchange and Brasilian BOVESPA. We have extensive experience working with global data providers that provide real-time market data for any of these exchanges. Our algorithms are designed to import these feeds and process the raw data necessary to produce our proprietary analytics.
 
Marketing of the Blackbox System
 
We launched our Blackbox System and platform for use in the United States and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Use of the platform is sold on a monthly or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com. We believe our Blackbox System subscriptions are priced competitively with similar web-based trading tools. We primarily use a combination of digital marketing campaigns and customer referral compensation plans in our advertising program. Our digital advertising efforts are comprised of display and video ads, along with banner and text ads across multiple search and social platforms. We also utilize targeted email marketing and a strategic global marketing campaign for brand awareness. We believe that this form of advertising has been and will continue to be effective in attracting subscribers. We continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of specific social media platforms and allocate marketing funds accordingly. We also promote our subscriptions through an established compensated customer referral program. We offer certain subscribers the right to promote the Blackbox System and receive referral fees for subscribers generated from such subscribers’ effort. Generally, we pay referring subscribers $25 for each subscription generated and $25 for each month the subscriber continues their subscription. We incurred $515,580 and $272,908 in customer referral expenditures in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect to continue utilizing the customer referral sales program as it has proven to be an extremely efficient form of advertising. Our advertising and marketing expense was $1,250,882 and $705,706 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We intend to continue to deploy a significant amount of marketing funds on both digital campaigns and customer referral programs in the future. In addition, we may also utilize television and radio advertising.
 
Industry Partners and Relationships
 
We have several arrangements and agreements with financial industry partners that encompass marketing partnerships, educational resources and licenses. We believe our relationship with large well-known brokerage firms enhance our credibility and provide added value to our members. Among these partnerships are marketing agreements with TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE and TastyTrade whereby these firms provide us with a referral fee for new accounts that we bring to them as well as offering our members discounted commissions on options trades. The referral fees are not currently material to our revenue but we believe the that our initial relationship with these firms is significant and provides us with an opportunity to expand these relationships to bring greater value to our members.
 
We have signed agreements with E*Trade and TradeStation permitting the integration of our platform with their brokerage platforms. These integrations allow our users to trade directly from our platform using their E*Trade or TradeStation account. In addition, TradeStation advertises our platform to 140,000 users through its webinars and in their internal app store. We believe the ability to enable our members to execute trades with third party brokers without having to leave our platform is particularly valuable to options traders who are able to execute more complicated orders without having to re-enter option contract information on another platform. We intend to integrate our platform with other brokers.
 
    8 

  

Industry partnerships such as the one we have with Options Industry Council, a non-profit entity funded by the Options Clearing Corp. also help provide our members with added educational benefits.
 
Data Suppliers
 
We contract with data suppliers and aggregators to provide our subscribers real time access to most major newswires, historical charting data and the real time stock and options data that drive the backend algorithms. We currently maintain servers connected with our stock and options data provider and utilize an Amazon Web Services (AWS) network as a backup. 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. The Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
We offer our subscribing customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore we do not believe we are subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of our Blackbox System or the services provided.Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Although, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or “scanner” and a social media platform within the same “dashboard” allowing members to view the same real-time data in parallel, there are a number of companies that offer one or more features that are similar to or attempt to address the same market as we do. These competitors have financial and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. The greatest amount of competition exists within products that provide trading analytics often referred to as “scanners”. We compete with these entities based on a number of factors including price, ease of use, standard features and proprietary features (if applicable). Ultimately, we believe the primary factor used in evaluating the trading analytics by any platform is the user’s ability to derive actionable information from that platform. This is where we believe our proprietary features differentiate the Blackbox System.
 
In addition to these technical tools, there are also a number of social media platforms that provide forums for traders and investors at little or no cost. The integration of our social media component within our platform creates a community that we believe is significantly superior to stand alone social media sites. Our members are able to interact and discuss ideas while viewing the same dashboard as opposed to having to switch back and forth between applications.
 
The final component to our platform is education. There are numerous standalone investment and trading applications, books, seminars and courses offered at many different price points. These products compete based on price, perceived value, level of sophistication and reputation among other factors. We offer our courses at no additional charge to our subscribers. In addition, we believe that our social media community provides our more experienced traders the opportunity to mentor newer traders which in turn contributes to the community environment we have developed.
 
    9 

  

In spite of these factors that differentiate us, we believe the following companies may be considered competitors due to similar product features and retail price points: Trade Ideas, Flow Algo and Trade Alert. Companies with social media platforms dedicated to financial markets include Stock Twits and Wall Street Bets.
 
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2022, the Company has fifteen full-time employees. We also currently have twenty-two contract workers that primarily serve as team traders on our Blackbox System platform or developers.
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified management, sales, marketing, and technical personnel. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees.
