Unless otherwise stated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “Foundation Building Materials,” “FBM,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Foundation Building Materials, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Company 
We are one of the largest specialty distributors of wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing in the United States and Canada. We have expanded from a single branch in Southern California in 2011 to more than 175 branches across the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2018, carrying a broad array of more than 30,000 SKUs. Our organic growth initiatives and disciplined acquisition strategy have enabled us to grow rapidly. Our net sales in 2013 were $113.7 million and we reached net sales of over $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our goal is to be the leading specialty building products distributor by continuing to expand into adjacent and complementary markets. 
We distribute wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, metal framing and complementary and other products to our customers. We serve as a critical link between our supplier base and a diverse and highly fragmented set of more than 22,000 customers, which are usually contractors who install these products in commercial and residential buildings for both new construction and repair and remodeling projects. 
We have an expansive branch network that serves attractive markets across the United States and Canada. The ability to leverage our branches, together with our organic growth initiatives and disciplined acquisition strategy, has allowed us to drive share gains in the specialty building products distribution market.
We believe that our customers select and trust us because we have the expertise to efficiently and effectively handle and deliver a broad range of product offerings. In addition, we manage the complex logistics required to safely deliver and stock the right products to the appropriate locations at each jobsite. It is critical for our contractor customers to have the correct product when they need it in order to complete their projects on time and on budget. We also provide our customers with technical product expertise, including proper installation techniques for new products. We typically deliver wallboard and other products directly to the floor where it will be installed from the first floor to the penthouse of a major high rise. For ceiling contractors, we carry a wide range of products and have the technical sales expertise to assist our customers in selecting the appropriate acoustical product for their project. Our North American scale gives us the ability to serve contractors and homebuilders that operate across multiple geographic markets. Most of our customer accounts are managed by salespeople and managers who communicate with customers on a regular basis and, as a result, have developed longstanding and trusted relationships. 
We have close relationships with our suppliers at the executive, regional and branch levels. We believe we are a distributor of choice for our suppliers due to our scale, nationwide footprint, leading market positions, knowledgeable professionals, high service levels and strong relationships with a broad set of contractor customers. In suspended ceiling systems, we have exclusive distribution relationships in select geographies for certain products. These relationships include contractual exclusivity with Armstrong World Industries, Inc., or Armstrong, a leading manufacturer of suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada, and relationship-based exclusivity with USG Corporation, or USG, a leading manufacturer of building products. Armstrong has supported our expansion by renewing our contractual exclusivity or extending our contractual exclusivity into additional territories after we acquired certain companies. This contractual exclusivity makes us the sole distributor carrying Armstrong products in certain markets. We also possess semi-exclusive distribution rights in other markets. 
We serve a balanced mix of end markets across the new non-residential construction, new residential construction and non-residential repair and remodel sectors. Our products are used in the new construction and repair and remodel of commercial buildings, single-family homes and multi-family homes. We believe activity in the new construction end markets will remain strong, since new non-residential activity and residential housing starts in the United States remain below historical averages.

We were founded in 2011 by our President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey and one of our Regional Vice Presidents, Tom Fischbeck. Mr. Mendoza previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Acoustical Material Services where he oversaw the successful growth of the company before it was acquired by Allied Building Products in 2007. In founding our company, Mr. Mendoza applied a proven customer-centric operating model that combines strong organic growth with an effective acquisition and integration program across a fragmented industry. In November 2013, we strengthened our management team with the addition of our Chief Operating Officer, Pete Welly, who has over 35 years of experience in our industry. Many members of our management team have spent the majority of their careers in the wallboard and suspended ceiling systems distribution industry. As a result, we have long and close personal relationships with many of the private owners of wallboard and suspended ceiling systems distributors, and our acquisitions generally have been completed on a privately negotiated, non-auction basis. Since 2013, the majority of senior level leaders who have sold us their businesses have elected to stay on as active employees and are often our best references to other owners considering a sale to us.
On October 9, 2015, 100% of the outstanding equity of FBM Intermediate Holdings LLC was acquired by investment funds, or affiliates of investment funds, advised, managed or controlled by Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.) L.P., which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K together with certain of its affiliates and associates (excluding us and other companies it owns as a result of its investment activities), as Lone Star, along with certain members of management for approximately $560.0 million.
Our acquisition activity is described in greater detail in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Recent developments
On November 1, 2018, we completed the sale of our Mechanical Insulation segment, or the Disposed Business, to SPI LLC, an unrelated third party controlled by Dunes Point Capital and its associated funds, for approximately $122.5 million (subject to certain adjustments). As a result of this sale, FBM operates in one segment. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Disposed Business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and to be presented as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we reclassified the results of operations and the cash flows of the Disposed Business to discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, statement of financial position, and consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Market leader with significant size and scale advantages
Our coast-to-coast footprint enables us to distribute our comprehensive product offerings to a large, diverse set of customers and provides us with significant economies of scale that we believe give us cost advantages versus our smaller competitors. As a leading specialty building products distributor, we are able to negotiate volume discounts and preferential pricing terms with our key suppliers. As we continue to grow, we believe we will realize additional cost savings and other benefits from scale. We have also been able to realize procurement discounts on our large fleet of over 2,500 vehicles, and we leverage this fleet to handle the logistical complexities of large scale specialty building products distribution, and to realize operational cost advantages from economies of scale. Additionally, our local market scale adds route density, which increases our profit margins. We believe our consolidated information technology systems and centralized administrative functions, which are shared nationally across our platform, generate additional operating cost efficiencies. 
Proven operating model 
We believe that our national operating model supported by local market expertise, entrepreneurial and customer-centric culture, acquisition and integration expertise and strong national brand has established us as the distributor of choice for leading suppliers and over 22,000 customers across certain construction-related end markets. Our management team originally utilized elements of this operating model while successfully growing prior companies and has applied those elements to our business. Since our inception, we have invested heavily in identifying, recruiting, training and retaining highly dedicated employees. We invest in ongoing talent development and focus on rewarding performance based on profitability goals instead of pursuing sales growth at the expense of profit margins. 
Our technology infrastructure and "One Company" platform allows us to manage our information technology efficiently. We have established a broad, integrated business platform that allows our branch network to leverage a centralized enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system and other back office support functions to minimize costs, while retaining important and timely decision-making authority at the local level where we conduct business with our customers and can tailor our service and product offerings to their needs. This autonomy at the local level has fostered our entrepreneurial culture, while our national infrastructure support allows employees to focus on customer-first solutions. 
Local market excellence 
We are a North American company focused on supplying the local building material needs of each geographical area we cover according to climate, building codes, customer preference and other considerations. We believe that we are able to maintain our local market excellence due to our longstanding customer and supplier relationships in local regions, dependable customer service, brand recognition and market-specific product offerings that cater to local trends and preferences. We actively track local and regional construction opportunities for our customers to help drive business for both them and ourselves, and our senior executives complement the local sales efforts by maintaining key relationships with major national and regional accounts. We seek to cultivate an entrepreneurial culture and empower branch managers with the independence and authority to make important business decisions locally under the FBM brand. We believe that this attracts highly dedicated employees who endeavor to provide our customers with local market expertise and dependable customer service that differentiates us from our competition. Our goal is to be the distributor of choice for our customers in all of the local markets we serve.
Strong customer relationships 
We sell to a diverse and highly fragmented base of over 22,000 customers, including commercial, residential and other specialty contractors. In addition to local contractors, we maintain regional relationships with regional non-residential construction companies and leading national homebuilders. Most customer accounts are serviced by managers and salespeople 
5

who communicate regularly with these accounts and have developed meaningful relationships over many years. We believe customer loyalty has been established through our high-quality customer service and technical support, strong logistics capabilities, trade credit offerings, exclusive relationships with key suppliers in critical markets and product expertise across our comprehensive selection of premier products and brands. We are able to safely and efficiently deliver products to our customers at the right time and in the specified location. Based on our customer surveys, contractors often prioritize on-time delivery over price as they consider the negative repercussions that project delays create, particularly increased labor costs. We have an integrated delivery, dispatch and order tracking system that allows us to optimize routes and create efficiencies. Optimization of delivery and dispatch results in lower costs for both delivery and fleet management. Additionally, for many of our products, we facilitate purchasing relationships between suppliers and our highly fragmented customer base by providing technical product knowledge, educating contractors on proper installation techniques for new products, enabling local product availability and extending trade credit. 
Longstanding relationships with leading suppliers 
We maintain longstanding relationships with a base of over 3,000 suppliers for whom we provide a direct channel to a large, diverse customer base across our national footprint. We are one of the largest customers for several of our top suppliers across the wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing product categories. We believe suppliers are attracted to our scale, consistent growth, nationwide footprint, leading market positions, knowledgeable professionals, local market expertise, quality customer service and strong relationships with a broad set of contractors. All key supplier relationships are led by our executive management team to foster long-term growth and maximize national pricing programs. We have access to leading brands and maintain exclusive distribution relationships to sell key products, such as suspended ceiling systems, in selected markets. Interior contractors often purchase wallboard and suspended ceiling systems from the same distributor, and our experience suggests carrying a ceilings product line helps to drive sales of wallboard and complementary products. We believe that our suppliers view us as a key facilitator to market and grow their businesses. We regularly discuss both acquisitions and greenfield expansion with our key suppliers, who may proactively recommend expansion opportunities to us. 
Demonstrated ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions 
Our management team has built our company from a single branch in 2011 into one of the leading specialty building products distributors in the United States and Canada. Since 2013, we have completed over 30 acquisitions and believe that the large, highly fragmented nature of our market and our reputation throughout the industry provides us access to a robust acquisition pipeline at attractive valuations that will continue to supplement our strong, organic growth. Our acquisitions generally have been initiated through our senior management team’s business relationships developed over their many years in the industry, and we believe we have become a buyer of choice for owners of specialty distribution companies because we offer them the opportunity to gain liquidity while remaining involved in the active management of their businesses going forward. This has led to a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition candidates that management is continuously cultivating. We have dedicated integration leaders who work closely with acquired branch personnel to unify acquisitions under a single brand with a common ERP system. We consolidate our acquired companies’ purchasing into our supplier purchasing programs, which generally have more advantageous terms due to our greater scale. We typically integrate each acquired company into our back office accounting, human resources and IT systems within 90 days of closing. 
Post-acquisition, we transition acquired companies exclusively to the FBM brand, and we have typically achieved additional cost savings from branch consolidations and the elimination of redundant overhead costs. Our acquisitions have historically realized purchasing synergies almost immediately by taking advantage of our volume discounts. Since 2013, many of the owners and senior management of companies that we have acquired have elected to remain employed with us post-acquisition which has proven to be successful to help ensure smooth transitions in the successful operation of the acquired businesses. 
Experienced management team with strong track record of growth 
Our management team, including our senior management and vice presidents, collectively have an average of over 25 years of industry experience. Our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, is an accomplished leader with over 25 years of industry experience. Our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey brings over 30 years of industry experience, our Chief Operating Officer Pete Welly brings over 35 years of industry experience and our Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing Kirby Thompson has been working in the industry for over 35 years. By fostering an entrepreneurial and customer-centric culture and a proven ability to quickly and effectively integrate acquisitions under a common brand, this team has built FBM from a single branch into one of the leading specialty building products distributors in the United States and Canada.

Our Business Strategy 
Our objective is to strengthen our competitive position, achieve profitable growth that exceeds market rates and increase stockholder value through the following key strategies: 
Continue to drive organic growth through strategic initiatives
We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to expand our existing geographic footprint by opening greenfield branches, expand our product offerings to existing customers and target new customers. 

• | Expand product offerings across all branches. Our management team has identified opportunities in several of our regions for product line growth and expansion. We offer a number of products that are complementary to our wallboard sales including tools, fasteners and wallboard accessories, stucco, plaster, insulation and fiberglass reinforced panels. We believe there is opportunity for additional expansion of our complementary product sales. We monitor sales of our complementary products and look for opportunities to introduce new products across our entire network that have been successful in a subset of our branches. 


• | Target new customers and increase share with existing customers. We believe our scale and supplier relationships allow us to more efficiently offer a full suite of products than many of our competitors. We believe these advantages help us win new customers, and we have a proven track record of growing customer relationships and expanding wallboard market share. We plan to continue this growth by leveraging our experienced and driven sales force of more than 245 field sales personnel who develop new customer relationships at the local level. We also believe our product breadth, extensive operating experience, technical knowledge and specialized delivery fleet will allow us to continue to capture new customers and expand our sales to those customers over time. We offer a mobile application that allows our customers to easily access critical information, such as order and delivery status, which we believe will further enhance our customers' relationship with our platform. 


• | Grow by selectively opening new branches. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to expand our geographic footprint by opening new branches that are adjacent to our existing operations. A greenfield branch has historically required up to $0.8 million in capital expenditures to open and typically generates positive cash flow within one year. On average, our greenfield branches return on invested capital is over 20% by year three. Key steps in the greenfield process include identifying growth markets where current customers or suppliers have identified a market need that we can support, conducting a market assessment, determining branch staffing and sales force, and developing a comprehensive forecast to determine if the location can meet profitability targets. In 2018, we opened five greenfield branches, and in 2019, we plan to open four to six greenfield branches. 

Continue to expand and strengthen existing relationships with key suppliers

We believe our established relationships with market-leading suppliers serve as a key competitive advantage and support continued volume growth and purchasing power. Our suppliers benefit from our position as a single point of contact to over 22,000 customers and our ability to market and introduce new products efficiently and on a national scale. We maintain exclusive and semi-exclusive distribution rights with certain suppliers in certain key markets. We believe that expanding our relationships with suppliers, whether by adding more exclusive products or expanding exclusivity into new regions, further accelerates our growth. Additionally, our suppliers are critical partners in our growth, and we regularly discuss potential greenfield branches with them, with suppliers sometimes proactively identifying expansion opportunities for us.
Enhance financial performance through improved operational efficiencies
We believe we have the potential for continued operating margin improvement through operational initiatives including optimizing pricing, improving fleet utilization, maximizing working capital efficiency from inventory and accounts receivable management, and strategic procurement processes. In addition, as our end markets continue to grow, we expect to generate higher operating margins on incremental volume as we leverage our fixed costs across our existing footprint. 
7

We strive to continuously improve our operational efficiency and are currently pursuing a number of initiatives to drive operating margin expansion, including efforts to: 

• | Monitor critical daily metrics to improve branch efficiencies, including overtime, revenue per truck and revenue per employee;


• | Leverage the "Track My Truck" feature on the FBM mobile application to provide real time delivery status for customer deliveries;


• | Use our GPS truck-tracking system throughout our business to reduce fleet costs, improve route planning and provide required electronic driver logs; and


• | Leverage our increased investment in electronic data interchange to improve efficiency for both the purchasing and accounts payable teams.

To further drive operational efficiencies, we unify all of our completed acquisitions under a single brand and a common ERP system. Our information technology systems are scalable and coordinated, which gives us operational efficiencies through the sharing of best practices and information across this common platform. We believe our information technology infrastructure allows for effective, data-driven management and is built to empower local decision-making and enhance visibility across our branch network. 
We incentivize our branch managers and customer-facing branch-level employees based on branch-level operating income, which we believe leads to improved branch-level performance. 
Continue to be a leading industry consolidator
From 2013 through the end of 2018, our management team has identified and closed over 30 acquisitions. We have successfully integrated all of these acquisitions. We believe our national footprint, market leadership, entrepreneurial culture and ability to retain key leadership makes us an attractive buyer. We are generally selective and pursue acquisitions that both expand our footprint and generate synergies. We have a dedicated team of professionals to manage the acquisition and integration process. Due to the large and highly fragmented nature of our market and our reputation throughout the industry, we believe that we have access to a robust acquisition pipeline at attractive valuations that will continue to supplement our organic growth. We will also consider expansion into complementary specialty distribution markets through acquisitions. 
Focus on culture and continuous improvement
We believe that our employees are one of the key drivers of our success, and we intend to continue to recruit, train, promote and retain entrepreneurial and successful people. We believe that we have created a culture where our people feel valued and supported and see that their efforts are instrumental to our continued success. We are focused on providing our employees with regular training and development to improve customer service, workplace safety and job satisfaction. We implemented "FBM University" to provide our employees with extensive training and development programs, utilizing new learning management systems and in-person training programs, which we view as essential for new hires and the development of existing employees. We also selected and implemented a new Learning Management System, or LMS, that is user friendly, easily modified, fully compatible with our other existing programs and systems, and cost effective. We invested substantially in leadership training and team building through our annual "Key Leaders Summit" meeting. By improving our employees’ knowledge base and sharing best practices, we are able to empower our people to better serve our customers. 
Commitment to safety
Our commitment to safety is one of our core foundational values. This effort begins immediately with new employees through a comprehensive onboarding orientation that focuses on safety awareness, risk identification and other essential safety protocols. Training is delivered through a variety of media, including our LMS and classroom settings, so that managers can employ the method that fits the employee’s needs.

Our Products 
We are a leading specialty distributor of a diversified mix of building products, including wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, metal framing, and complementary and other products. We are one of the largest wallboard and suspended ceiling systems distributors in the United States and Canada based on our 2018 net sales. We provide customers with comprehensive product offerings, with over 30,000 SKUs. Our product breadth, combined with our commitment to quality customer service, has solidified our position as a supplier of choice. Our diversified product offerings provide balanced exposure to several construction end markets. 
Wallboard 
We specialize in the distribution of high-quality wallboard used to finish the interior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial construction projects. Wallboard is used in the vast majority of new construction and renovation projects due to its ease of installation and superior performance in providing comfort, fire resistance, thermal and sound insulation, mold and moisture resistance, impact resistance and aesthetic and design elements. It is available in a number of standard lengths, widths and thicknesses with a range of characteristics. Panels with greater thickness provide increased durability and sound insulation. In non-residential construction projects, architectural specifications and building codes provide requirements related to the thickness of the panels and, in some cases, other characteristics, such as fire, mold and moisture resistance. Wallboard is an essential building product, with approximately 8,000 square feet of wallboard used on average in each new home. Given the importance of wallboard to the overall building process, contractors have very precise delivery expectations which are best met by experienced specialty building products distributors with a local presence and specialized equipment. 
Suspended ceiling systems
Suspended ceiling systems and grid help ensure and enhance the integrity, protection and decorative finishing of interior spaces. The ceilings product line consists of a higher number of specialized SKUs and less product standardization than the wallboard market. We believe ceiling product availability often pulls in additional business to our branches, as contractors often look to source additional interior products from a single distributor. The ceilings industry has enjoyed price stability through various cycles. Commoditization risk is limited as customers often seek specific design and aesthetic characteristics unique to their space. The market is characterized by high manufacturer concentration. Ceilings are sold into both non-residential repair and remodel and new non-residential construction markets.
We maintain exclusive distribution rights in certain markets with Armstrong, a leading manufacturer of suspended ceiling systems, in the United States and Canada. Armstrong’s products are highly sought after by designers, contractors, builders and distributors. We have exclusive distribution rights for Armstrong ceilings in multiple markets across seven states and six Canadian provinces and non-exclusive distribution rights with Armstrong in multiple markets across twenty-five states and two other Canadian provinces. Armstrong closely oversees the marketing of its products, and generally grants distribution rights to only one or two companies in a given market. In addition, we have relationship-based exclusivity with USG, a leading manufacturer of building products in select markets in three states and non-exclusive relationships with USG in select markets across two states. 
Metal framing 
We provide metal framing and other framing products for multiple uses, including interior partitions and load bearing walls. We source our products from local, regional and national manufacturers in accordance with building standards and codes. Commercial contractors typically purchase these materials with wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, insulation and other related building products from us as part of a commercial package. 
Complementary and other products 
We offer complementary and other products, tools and accessories such as wallboard accessories, stucco and finishing systems, safety accessories, fasteners, insulation, doors and roofing products. Certain products are provided on a regional basis to address local preferences. These complementary products allow us to provide a full suite of products across our entire business, enhancing our margins and creating value for our customers. 
9

 Wallboard accessories are generally sold as a package in conjunction with wallboard and include most products used for the installation and finishing of wallboard. Key wallboard accessories include joint compounds, trims, tapes and various other accessories.
Customers and Suppliers 
Customers 
We sell to a diverse and highly fragmented base of over 22,000 customers, including commercial, residential and other specialty contractors. In addition to local contractors, we maintain strong relationships with regional construction companies and leading national homebuilders. Most customer accounts are serviced by managers and salespeople who communicate regularly with these accounts and have developed meaningful relationships built over many years. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no customers that exceeded 10% of net sales.
Suppliers 
We maintain longstanding relationships with a base of over 3,000 suppliers, with no single supplier accounting for more than approximately 15% of our purchases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We are one of the largest customers for several of our top suppliers across wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing. We believe that suppliers find our scale, nationwide footprint, leading market positions, knowledgeable professionals, local market expertise, quality customer service and strong relationships with a broad set of contractors attractive. We have strong relationships with leading wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing manufacturers, and we are able to provide them with a direct channel to a large, diverse customer base and a national footprint. 
Sales and Marketing 
We utilize a sales strategy that enables our sales force to develop strong customer relationships at the local level. The sales effort is managed by sales or branch managers and executed by both inside and outside sales teams. Due to the service-oriented and relationship-driven nature of the sales process, it is important to have experienced teams in each local market. To ensure customer expectations are met, our sales teams include both product sales specialists and sales managers who focus on specific products, categories and regions. We also tailor our sales approach to best suit customer needs within each end market. Both the commercial and residential sales processes are largely relationship-driven, although the commercial sales process is also highly technical and requires product knowledge with a sophisticated material delivery plan.
We employ both inside sales and field sales personnel. Inside sales personnel primarily service customers at the branches, by phone or email, while field sales personnel primarily sell to customers face-to-face. These representatives are responsible for driving new customer sales and maintaining, as well as growing, existing customer relationships. Our executives complement the local sales efforts by continuing to maintain key relationships with major national and regional accounts while sharing their significant experience with various sales organizations and reinforcing a customer-centric philosophy. We also coordinate closely with our major suppliers to optimize specific sales strategies. In addition to providing customer relationship support, our executive team also coordinates the go-to-market strategy and provides ongoing job and product training. Given the importance of strong local relationships, we thoroughly vet the strength of an acquisition target’s long-term customer relationships. Our management views these local relationships and the sales team of any acquired company to be critical to a successful integration. 
We employ various marketing strategies to reach our customers in the most efficient and effective manner. We market our products and services through our website, mobile app, sample kits, advertisement materials and trade shows. Employees are encouraged to participate in industry associations as another point of customer connectivity. Certain employees are members and have served as officers and directors of numerous industry associations, including the Association of the Wall and Ceiling Industry, Ceilings & Interior Systems Construction Association, EIFS Industry Members Association and selected other regional associations. Furthermore, we sponsor a number of annual conventions and trade shows. Management believes that some of our most effective marketing is "word-of-mouth" given our reputation for high-quality products, superior customer service, product expertise and stellar delivery performance. We also benefit from the marketing and brand strength of several key suppliers, especially those with whom we hold exclusive or semi-exclusive arrangements.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,400 employees, 206 of whom were unionized. We enjoy a strong relationship with our employees, including our unionized employees. We have not experienced a work stoppage, and we currently have no ongoing labor disputes.
10

 Health and Safety 
We approach health and safety through an operationally driven safety program utilizing a common approach that encourages the sharing of best practices across the specialty building products distribution industry. Our safety practices have an operational focus and we work closely with all levels of management on developing and managing our company-wide safety program. We have a strong management commitment to safety from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer to the branch operating level. We have a clearly defined safety structure that includes dedicated Regional Safety Coordinators to drive harmonization of safety protocols across the entire branch network. The Regional Safety Coordinators support branch Safety Champions whose duties are integrated as a shared responsibility within their operations role. Through branch ownership of the safety program, the Safety Champion works with their local management and Regional Safety Coordinator on day-to-day safety issues including incident reporting and investigation, inspections and training needs. Through our internal protocols and safety training programs, we strive to be an industry leader in developing and promoting a strong safety culture. The effort begins immediately with new employees through a comprehensive orientation that focuses on safety awareness, risk identification, hazard communication and other essential safety protocols. We deliver training through a variety of media, including our LMS modules, hands on training and classroom settings. Our employees share the responsibility to work in a manner that safeguards themselves, their coworkers and the communities they serve. We work diligently with our employees and continually advocate adherence to the highest safety standards. Management’s expectations and policy toward safety is clearly communicated and is supported by our "Safety Absolutes," which are key rules that all of our employees are required to follow.
Competition
We compete primarily against other specialty building product distributors, as well as big-box retailers and lumberyards. Among specialty building products distributors, we compete against a small number of large national distributors and many small, local, privately owned distributors. Our remaining competitors are generally smaller regional and local firms, many of which we view as attractive acquisition opportunities. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; timely and comprehensive delivery capabilities; pricing of products; and availability of credit to customers.
Seasonality 
Use and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality. Nearly all of the products we sell are exposed to outdoor elements during delivery or installation. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations. Our shipment levels also follow activity in the construction industry, which typically increases in the more moderate seasons of spring, summer and fall. 
Government Regulations 
Although we are not engaged in a "regulated industry," we are subject to various federal, state and local government regulations applicable to the business generally in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, work place safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws, codes and regulations.
