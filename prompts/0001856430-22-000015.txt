Our Vision
Bringing together people, integrators and products to deliver joy, connectivity and security in our everyday lives.
Our Company
Snap One powers smart living by enabling professional integrators to deliver seamless experiences in the connected homes and small businesses where people live, work and play. The combination of our end-to-end product ecosystem delivered through our powerful distribution network and further bolstered by technology-enabled workflow solutions, which we refer to as our “Only Here” strategy, provides a compelling value proposition to our loyal and growing network of over 16,000 professional do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) integrators. We believe that Only Here can integrators access a leading, comprehensive suite of products and software solutions that enable a “one-stop shop” experience. Only Here can integrators support their customers via our industry-leading remote management software platform, which reaches approximately 424,000 active homes and businesses as of December 31, 2021. Only Here can integrators enjoy the convenience of an e-commerce centric, omni-channel distribution model to support their workflow. Only Here can our third-party product partners efficiently access the professional integrator market through our distribution reach and integrate into the broader Snap One product and software ecosystem. By partnering with Snap One, integrators can focus on their trade and leverage the tools and infrastructure that we deliver to build thriving and profitable businesses. We believe our Only Here value proposition becomes embedded into integrators’ workflow throughout the project lifecycle, creating re-occurring spending patterns that strengthen our integrator relationships and enhance our revenue visibility across our integrator base.
Snap One was founded by integrators for integrators. We believe our Only Here experience makes us the partner of choice for professional integrators. Our leading end-to-end ecosystem of proprietary SKUs, alongside a curated set of third-party products, provides differentiated portfolio depth and the convenience of a “one-stop shop” experience for our integrators.
Our industry-leading software solutions enhance the interoperability of our products and enable our emerging portfolio of value-added, subscription-based services. We are vertically integrated, with the majority of our net sales coming from our proprietary-branded, internally developed products that are only available to integrators directly from Snap One. These proprietary products are manufactured on an asset-light basis through our network of contract manufacturing and joint development suppliers located primarily in Asia and support our net sales of $1,008.0 million and Contribution Margin of 40.5%, in each case during fiscal year 2021. In addition, we support our integrators with a comprehensive suite of software and support workflow solutions. We engage with our integrators on an omni-channel basis, blending the benefits of our comprehensive e-commerce portal with the convenience of our local branch network for same-day product availability. We support our integrators throughout the entire lifecycle of their projects from pre-sale product research and system design to post-installation end consumer support via our proprietary OvrC software, which enables integrators to remotely manage, configure and troubleshoot devices in the field. We believe our solutions make it easier for professional integrators to operate and profitably grow their businesses, contributing to increased retention and wallet share growth with us over time. We believe our Only Here value proposition creates entrenched relationships and re-occurring spending patterns with our integrators. We believe these favorable integrator dynamics yield an attractive financial profile with a high degree of visibility into integrators’ spending patterns.
Our Market Opportunity
The growing global residential and commercial technology market is comprised of Do-it-Yourself (“DIY”) and Do-It-For-Me (“DIFM”) end consumer spend, which market research consultant Frost & Sullivan estimates is expected to grow at a 9.3% compound annual growth rate from $329.2 billion in 2020 to $513.1 billion in 2025.
The DIFM sub-market that we serve is distinct from the DIY sub-market, and is characterized by consumers with higher expectations, more complicated projects, higher income, and use of professionals in other parts of their lives. DIFM consumers typically spend $10,000 to $20,000 for professional integrators to design, select the best products, and install and configure these systems. Each of these projects represents an opportunity for Snap One to provide the products the integrator needs to serve their customers.
Consumers’ increasing desire to have an integrated, turnkey, easy-to-use system is expected to drive growth in the DIFM sub-market across home technology, security, and commercial; Frost & Sullivan estimates that integrator spend in the domestic DIFM sub-market (consisting of home technology, security, and commercial) will grow at an 8.7% compound annual growth rate from $43.0 billion in 2020 to $65.2 billion in 2025.
We believe the following trends will continue to accelerate the global home technology market and to support the increasing importance of the DIFM integrator to deliver the experiences that end consumers seek.
Increasing Awareness and Adoption of Smart Living Solutions
Consumer adoption of smart living solutions continues to rise, driven by increasing access to high-speed internet service and growth in smart connected devices, streaming services, voice assistants and simple and unified control experiences. Well-known technology leaders such as Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have created innovative and affordable point products that have broadened access to entry level smart living experiences and increased interest in the full potential of the home. The desire to be able to control your sound volume through a traditional remote control has evolved into an expectation that lighting, temperature, music, entertainment, security, consumer appliances and more respond to a user’s needs proactively or create a bespoke experience with the push of an icon on an app or a voice command. According to Statista, smart home penetration in the United States is expected to increase to 57% in 2025 from 37% in 2020, and we believe consumers will increasingly demand more complete and complex systems.
Growing Desire for Entertainment, Security, Comfort, and Energy Efficiency in the Home
Now more than ever before, people live, work and play at home. As a result, there is a growing demand to enhance the at-home experience with immersive, simple, integrated and supported products and systems. For example, end consumers want:
•High-end home entertainment systems to support direct-to-streaming movie releases;
•Multi-room audio systems streaming their favorite music from any place in the home with the press of a button;
•Home security and video surveillance with smart phone and tablet accessibility to help ensure their family stays safe;
•Smart lighting, shades, heating and cooling systems to manage their environment and make their home more energy efficient;
•Reliable whole-home networks that ensure connectivity for multiple simultaneous uses by the entire family such as video conferencing indoors while streaming a movie in the backyard; and
•Intuitive and flexible control solutions that unify the interactive experience in the home.
Consumer Pain Points Driving Increasing Need for Professional Integrators
The direct-to-consumer smart living product category is highly fragmented, with thousands of disparate, unintegrated point products across multiple categories resulting in an experience that is often frustrating, complicated and time-intensive for the end consumer. Mass market DIY products are intended to meet single-point tasks, and are not generally designed to seamlessly integrate across multiple manufacturers into a fully personalized smart living solution, nor to meet the exacting needs of high-end purchasers. In addition, end consumers lack awareness of all the mission-critical infrastructure, networking and control products, and the software required to create an integrated system, and also lack the time and expertise to install and troubleshoot these system components. We believe a large and growing segment of end consumers want the best available smart living experience and are willing to pay for professional assistance to create a fully integrated, comprehensive system and to maintain, service, and upgrade their systems over time. We believe the importance of integrators will continue to grow as they become an increasingly critical specialist to end consumers.
Challenges for Integrators Driving Need for a Partner that is a One-Stop Shop for All Their Needs
The typical integrators we serve are small- to medium-sized businesses that enable smart living. They are experts at designing, installing, and servicing complex, fully integrated connected home and business systems, which include products such as audio, video, surveillance, lighting, home automation, and more for both homeowners and commercial customers. These integrators serve DIFM consumers who typically spend $10,000 to $20,000 per job. In addition, integrators do not typically hold inventory, requiring them to place multiple orders to procure the products and software needed for each job.
Due to their small size, integrators often face significant challenges to meet the needs of their end customers and run their businesses efficiently. These challenges include tracking thousands of products across multiple suppliers needed for each job, keeping up with the latest product trends, and understanding how to install, integrate, and support these highly complex and evolving technologies. As a result, integrators need a partner that can serve as a one-stop shop for the products, software, tools, and training that they need day in and day out to efficiently operate their businesses and deliver great experiences for end consumers.
Our Differentiated Solution
We believe our integrated platform of products, software, and support solutions that are embedded into the integrator’s workflow is unmatched in the industry. We simplify the challenges associated with designing a smart living system and enable our integrators to create optimal solutions that are cohesive, functional, and efficient. Every decision we make is through the lens of helping integrators run their business more efficiently while delivering immersive smart living experiences. This results in a long-term partnership in our shared mission to bring joy, connectivity and security into end consumers’ everyday lives.
Our End-to-End Product Ecosystem
We provide integrators with a leading, comprehensive suite of connected, infrastructure, entertainment, and software solutions so the entire smart living experience is exceptional for the end consumer. Our product and service offerings encompass all of the design elements required by integrators to build integrated smart living systems that are easy to install and simple to manage, serving the needs of both integrators and end consumers. Our deep relationships with our individual integrators provides us the real-time feedback that allows us to continuously improve our offerings.
•Proprietary Products and Software. We have developed a broad range of proprietary SKUs that encompass the spectrum of solutions needed to deliver integrated smart living systems. These products and software are sold under our proprietary brands such as Araknis, Control4, and Wattbox and are only sold through Snap One with confidential wholesale prices that allow integrators to maximize their profitability. Our products and software are designed to meet the unique needs of both the integrator and the DIFM end consumer. We do this by delivering a high quality and reliable cross-category integrated solution that connects easily to our proprietary solutions and third-party products. In addition, our solutions have built-in firmware to allow for a high degree of configurability with useful management tools, which make it easy for integrators to provide mission critical post-installation support. Through our proprietary software, Control4 OS3 and OvrC, we allow integration with thousands of products manufactured by hundreds of third-party manufacturers, and our products are compatible with connected devices from leading brands such as Alphabet, Amazon and Apple, allowing end consumers to enjoy and control their integrated system with the products and devices they know and love.
•Third-Party Products. In addition to our proprietary solutions, we have partnered with and sell a curated set of leading third-party products from brands such as Alphabet, Amazon, KEF, Klipsch, Lutron, Samsung, Sony, Sonos, Ubiquiti and Yamaha, which provide our integrators a one-stop shop for their product needs. We believe this increases the value we deliver to our integrators, grows the usage of our technology-enabled workflow solutions, and drives integrator retention and growth. Our third-party product offerings also deliver significant value to our third-party partners. We provide these third-party partners with differentiated access to our expansive network of integrators through our omni-channel model and compatibility with our leading software solutions, which ensures those products can be seamlessly integrated into a system and easily supported after installation.
Our Software and Support Workflow Solutions
Our differentiated technology and software workflow tools have been designed to support the integrator throughout the project lifecycle, enhancing their operations and helping them to profitably grow their businesses. We believe our suite of embedded solutions is truly unique, further differentiating Snap One from the rest of the smart living market, and driving stickiness and wallet share growth with integrators.
▪Integrator Job Lifecycle Service and Support. We provide comprehensive certification and award-winning training and support services, enabling integrators’ ongoing success and business efficiency. Our comprehensive services are delivered through multiple channels, including through our cloud software, on our e-commerce portal and at our local branches, and encompass every step of the integrator job lifecycle from research and training through post-installation support. For example, we have remote management solutions that enable continuous end consumer system monitoring and management and significantly reduce or eliminate time-consuming and costly post-installation troubleshooting for the integrator. Additionally, we have a dedicated team of technical experts who help integrators with product awareness, product training and on-the-job troubleshooting support to ensure the best solutions are delivered in the right way to end consumers. We believe the 16 CE Pro Quest for Quality Awards we won in 2021 are a testament to the value of our service and support programs for integrators.
▪Cloud-Based Software. We have developed a suite of proprietary cloud-based software solutions that are embedded in the integrator’s workflow through the lifecycle of a project and enable remote management and monitoring of connected devices after installation. Our Control4 Composer tool provides an easy-to-use interface that helps integrators configure highly customized control systems for end consumers. OvrC is a free, cloud-based software, which enables integrators to remotely monitor, troubleshoot and manage connected devices on a system. While OvrC is available free to integrators, we utilize its strong functionality and presence with end consumers to enable Parasol, which is our subscription-based remote monitoring service for end consumers. By utilizing these software tools, integrators can significantly increase efficiency by reducing the need for service calls and ensuring that their customers’ mission-critical systems are installed properly and supported thereafter, resulting in continuous highly personalized, immersive experiences.
▪Omni-Channel Model. We provide a comprehensive e-commerce portal for smart living, which is tailored to allow integrators to research products, design projects, receive training and certifications, order products, and solicit ongoing support. It provides targeted content and compelling stories to drive meaningful interactions with integrators who typically visit the portal ten times to research, train, design, and build an estimate for each purchase they ultimately make. We supplement our e-commerce portal with a growing footprint of 31 local domestic branches as of December 31, 2021. These local branches are key to supporting our growth strategy and delivering additional value to integrators by ensuring they can receive critical products on a same-day basis to support project requirements, while attending in-person trainings and using local demonstration rooms to test new products.
The integration of our end-to-end product and software ecosystem and technology and software solutions drives industry-leading efficiency for our integrators. Our tools support efficient integration, empowering our integrators to focus on the next install, rather than on maintaining the last install. We believe we set the industry standard for ease of use for integrators, which we believe drives loyalty and increased use of our platform over time.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from our competitors and position us for continued leadership in enabling connectivity in the home:
▪Partner of Choice for Smart Living Integrators. Snap One was founded by integrators for integrators. We designed our integrated platform through the lens of the integrator to enhance their operations by simplifying the product purchasing experience and delivering high-quality products at a good value, while at the same time providing technology-enabled tools and support services to help them run their businesses more efficiently. We 
believe our ability to deliver both the product breadth and technology solutions that support the integrators workflow is unique in our category. Snap One is a leading partner for professional integrators, transacting with over 20% of the domestic DIFM market. We believe our strong position with integrators is supported by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) of 55 among domestic integrators who have purchased from Snap One between March 2020 and March 2021, compared to competing brands’ average NPS of -2. We are passionate about providing integrators the best products, software, and technology-enabled workflow solutions to allow them to deliver entertainment security, comfort, and energy efficiency experiences to their customers.

Our product and software development process fosters an innovation feedback loop whereby we utilize the user and integrator feedback and learnings from our cloud software to continually enhance existing solutions to meet the demands of the connected homes and businesses of tomorrow. We believe this feedback loop combined with our joint-development model of partnering with manufacturers around the latest technologies, allow us to rapidly and efficiently bring new technology to market with lower R&D risk to Snap One. Our strong product and software development engine is supported by a team of 336 product development employees, 151 of which are software engineers.
▪Platform Solutions Embedded in the Integrator Workflow Make it Easier to Do Business. Our mission is to empower integrators to make it easier for them to profitably grow their businesses and deliver best-in-class immersive experiences to end consumers. Our scale allows us to continue to invest in and develop differentiated technology tools that are embedded into the integrators workflow to support their needs throughout the project lifecycle. Our e-commerce platform has rich content to inform product research, design tools to enhance project planning, training materials and installation guides, and a robust forum where integrators can learn about and discuss solutions and technical issues before and during installation. We supplement this content with an experienced team of customer and technical support employees, receiving the Quest for Quality Awards of Best Customer Service (#1 Platinum) and Best Technical Support (#2 Gold) in 2021. We also offer a suite of proprietary cloud-based software solutions. These solutions include Control4 Composer, which allows integrators to configure the logic rules of a connected home or business and OvrC, which gives integrators the ability to manage all connected devices remotely post install without a service call; and OvrC Home, which allows integrators to use software to give the power of the typical support functions directly to end consumers. We believe these technology tools and services drive robust stickiness as integrators build their businesses around these capabilities and train their employees to use our software and products.
▪E-Commerce Driven, Omni-Channel Strategy. Our business model is built around an e-commerce centric, omni-channel go-to-market strategy. We provide a comprehensive e-commerce portal, which allows integrators to easily research products, design projects, receive training and certifications, order products, and solicit ongoing support. Our e-commerce portal is complemented by an extensive network of 31 domestic local branches and seven distribution centers, as of December 31, 2021. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we opened or acquired eight net new local domestic branches, and we expect to continue to expand in the future. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Recent Developments” for a description of our acquisition of Staub Electronics, Ltd, which included two local branches in Canada, in January 2022. The local branch presence is an important part of our strategy as it allows us to better serve integrators locally by providing same-day product availability when necessary, while creating a site for relationship building, training and product demonstration sessions. We believe integrators value the relationships and support we deliver at the local level, and this further increases their loyalty to our business across channels.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that end consumers need a professionally integrated platform for the next generation of smart living spaces that consists of the best products, services and software to deliver personalized, immersive experiences. The following are the central pillars to our growth strategy that we believe will enable us to provide integrators and end consumers with the solutions and workflow tools that will power the smart living spaces of tomorrow:
▪Consistent Innovation with New Products, Software and Solutions. Our award-winning products and software and shared product development model are key drivers of our success to date. We will continue to invest in enhancing our product suite and bolstering our underlying software, and developing technologies to make integrators more efficient, which is critical to delivering the best solutions for our integrators and end consumers.
▪Drive Wallet Share Gains with Existing Integrators. While our network of over 16,000 domestic DIFM integrators that we transact with is large, we believe we have a significant wallet share expansion opportunity with our existing integrator base. As we continue to expand our omni-channel coverage, extend our product suite, bolster our support services, and create deeper integration across our products, we believe we will be able to drive continued wallet share gains by making it compelling for integrators to use Snap One as their primary one-stop shop.
▪Grow Our Network of Integrators. We have a clear leading market share within our core domestic home technology market, and our product portfolio and integrator support are designed to expand into attractive adjacent markets. We are making investments to grow our network of integrators across home technology and the attractive security and commercial markets, where we have low market penetration today. Our network currently consists of over 16,000 of the over 70,000 domestic DIFM integrators across home technology, security and commercial markets. Within the 70,000 total domestic DIFM integrators, approximately 17,500 are home technology focused, approximately 20,000 are security focused and approximately 32,500 are commercial focused. In addition, we believe the market for continued geographic expansion represents a significant opportunity for Snap One given our modest presence outside the United States today, as evidenced by international accounting for 11.8% of our net sales in fiscal year 2021.
▪Efficiently Expand Our Software Solutions and Subscription-Based Revenue Models. As we expand our penetration of connected homes and businesses domestically, we will continue to invest in the expansion of existing and development of new subscription-based services. We believe our leadership position and expanding presence in the home through OvrC, Parasol and 4Sight will allow us to develop new high margin, recurring software-driven services.
▪Continue to Pursue Accretive Acquisitions. Our disciplined acquisition strategy is core to our growth with past acquisitions complementing our product suite and expanding our nationwide coverage. Over the last five years, we have successfully completed and integrated more than ten acquisitions targeting new products and geographies and enhancing our workflow solutions. We will continue to pursue future acquisitions that selectively enhance our 
products, software and workflow solutions and expand into adjacent markets that allow us to serve our integrator base. We believe our network of third-party products as well as our close relationships with our integrators allow us to source a large pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities.

Accordingly, our Infrastructure products are often an integrator preference item, so we engineer our solutions with reliability, ease of installation and integrator workflow in mind. Our Infrastructure product portfolio includes structured wiring and cables, racks and mounts.
Our Software Solutions
Our software solutions enable our integrators to provide optimized, personalized connected systems for our end consumers. Our proprietary OvrC system provides integrators with a free, cloud-based remote management and monitoring solution that enables integrators to troubleshoot connected devices and home systems remotely. As of December 31, 2021, OvrC had approximately 424,000 active homes and businesses on the platform. Integrators can now resolve many product issues that may occur following an installation without making follow-up home visits. This saves the integrator time and money while improving their customers’ satisfaction. In addition, we offer our OvrC Home software to end consumers, which provides them with the ability to manage their systems and fix small, common problems without needing to know system complexities. For instance, with OvrC Home, a consumer can reset their Wattbox power outlets and troubleshoot system issues without having to physically access it themselves or call for professional support. This provides value and convenience to end consumers.
Additionally, our Control4 OS3 system is our leading product for command and control of smart living systems and is in approximately 435,000 active homes and businesses as of December 31, 2021. We have expanded our control platform capabilities and meaningfully enhanced the end consumer experience through the integration of audio, video, lighting, temperature, security, communications, voice and other functionalities throughout the home.
Our OvrC and Control4 OS3 software provide the foundation supporting the pillars of our growth strategy, which we have built upon to launch and monetize value-added services for end consumers. We have an identified pipeline of growth opportunities where we can leverage our existing OvrC and Control4 OS3 software to create unique subscription-based solutions that generate recurring revenue. We currently have two subscription-based services that we sell to homeowners. Parasol is enabled by our OvrC software and gives homeowners access to continuous remote support service to proactively or reactively troubleshoot devices on their network. 4Sight is enabled by our Control4 OS3 software and provides homeowners with access and control of their home solutions and communications. Using 4Sight, end consumers can remotely monitor and control their systems as if they were at their homes.
Our Platform Workflow Solutions
Our differentiated technology and software solutions enhance the operations of integrators. These embedded solutions further differentiate Snap One from the rest of the smart living market. They provide utility from the beginning of a project through post-project monitoring and are a key driver of stickiness and wallet share growth with our integrators. We believe we operate a comprehensive e-commerce portal for smart living. Our portals generate value for integrators by providing business optimization and support tools through the lifecycle of any given project. This continuous integrator engagement enables continuing feedback from multiple points of interaction and gives us a rich data set, to which we apply analytical tools to target promotions, cross-selling and up-selling.
Our cloud-based software solutions, including OvrC and Control4 OS3, generate additional value for our integrators by allowing them to remotely monitor and manage connected systems after installation. These software solutions increase efficiency for our integrators by eliminating the number of costly service appointments, and providing tools to help continue to support and build consumer relationships through continuous system monitoring and management.

In certain markets, we amplify our research and training offering by providing consultations with local representatives and local training events. Given the pace of technological change, this offering allows our integrators to stay up to speed on the latest products and trends in the industry.
•System Design and Quote. Our design tools give integrators access to technical drawings and CAD files in order to ensure the products they order fit their customers’ homes and work together seamlessly. This is an essential component of delivering the right solutions for their customers. Integrators place orders with precision, reducing 
shrinkage and the potential for timing delays on executing their projects. We also have a confidential quoting and pricing system that is only available for our integrators.
•Order and Fulfillment. Our nationwide distribution network allows us to serve integrators through strong delivery and local fulfillment. In addition, our local branch network allows us in many cases to provide integrators with same-day pickup for products that are required for projects. This helps increase integrators’ efficiency since same-day delivery is mission-critical for integrators as the lack of any one component can stall a project. We also provide our third-party partners with an efficient distribution channel for their products through our network. Our partners are able to access our expansive integrator base, which creates value for our partners and strengthens our commercial relationships.
•Install, Set-Up and Program. We have award-winning support services available through our online portal. Our portal provides various training videos, documents and other tools that ensure proper product installation. Product support technicians stand at the ready to handle calls and help our integrators successfully execute their product installs. We serve as an outsourced technical team that supports our integrators’ success. In addition, our Control4 Composer software tool provides an intuitive interface that enables integrators to construct a bespoke control system for homeowners at the end of the product installation phase. Through Composer, integrators can create different “scenes” for homeowners, and enable the integration of various connected devices around the home. Overall, the level of support we provide is differentiated due to our immediate accessibility and our ability to help our integrators execute projects across the full range of products selected for the job at hand.
•Business Administration. Integrators can use our platform to access invoices, track orders along with order history for their customers, and manage returns. Through these various points of interaction with our integrators, we have a robust data set, which we analyze to target promotions, cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.
•Ongoing Support. We provide our integrators with on-going monitoring capabilities so they can deliver superior service to their customers. Our OvrC offering, the remote management and monitoring platform for integrators, creates increased efficiency, as integrators can monitor systems and fix any issues remotely, reducing the need for inefficient service calls. This allows integrators to perform their projects with greater efficiency and effectiveness, creating durable relationships and strong brand loyalty with integrators. We also deliver award-winning training, certification, and support services, built to drive integrators’ ongoing success. We deliver our support programs both online and at local branches. The training support staff in our branches can provide integrators with tools and various services throughout the lifecycle of their projects. This allows us to build deep relationships with our integrator base by embedding our services in our integrators’ workflow, and gives us insights into real time integrator feedback.
Our Software and Product Development
We have a robust R&D organization that focuses on the development of new products, software, and technology-driven workflow solutions as well as the enhancement of our existing solutions. Our product and software development process fosters an innovation feedback loop whereby we leverage end consumer and integrator feedback to continually enhance existing solutions. Through our joint-development model, we partner with manufacturers to reliably and rapidly bring new product technology to market and reduce the risk of R&D investment. We focus our internal product development efforts on the application of these leading technologies to the specific challenges faced by integrators and their customers. Our strategy of “fast following” major technology standards while investing in differentiation for the integrator allows us to maintain market-leading products with an efficient, innovative, and capital-light organization. We believe our products are the best-of-breed in their respective categories. We expect to continue to invest substantial resources in R&D to expand our integrated platform of products, software, and technology-driven workflow solutions.
Omni-Channel Distribution and Manufacturing
Our nationwide distribution network allows us to service integrators through strong delivery and local fulfillment. Our proprietary products are received at one of our five strategically located U.S. distribution centers, along with a selection of third-party products, which allows our integrators to bundle their purchases for an entire job with one partner either through our leading e-commerce site or for local purchase and or pickup at one of our 31 local domestic branches as of December 31, 2021. These local branches are key to delivering additional value to our integrators, as we can in many cases provide 
same-day delivery of products that integrators may require for projects. Same day delivery can be mission critical for integrators as the lack of any one component can stall a project. Our local branches are more than fulfillment centers. We have training sessions and support staff in our branches to provide integrators with various services throughout the lifecycle of their projects. Our local branches also allow us to build deeper relationships with our existing integrator base, giving us insights into real-time feedback, and to expand our network by reaching the local population of integrators.
In addition to our internal capabilities, we partner with a network of over 50 contract manufacturing and over 80 joint development suppliers to produce our proprietary products. Our supply chain teams, both in the United States and in Asia, partner closely with our suppliers through design, sourcing, quality validation and logistics to ensure high quality, high availability products for our integrators. The majority of our supplier spend on our proprietary products was with Asia-based suppliers. We maintain contractual and operational safeguards designed to align with our suppliers and ensure high standards in quality. In addition to the work we do with our supplier partners, we perform full custom manufacturing of our Triad speaker line in Portland, Oregon along with light assembly of a few other products in Charlotte, North Carolina and Salt Lake City, Utah for configure to order support.
Recently our global supply chain operations, including component sourcing, shipping, and logistics, have experienced impacts related to COVID-19 and the various associated regulatory responses, similar to other companies in our industry. These impacts have resulted in delayed product availability in some cases. We expect these impacts, including potential delayed product availability, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges, but we continue to invest in supply chain initiatives to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related issues.
Sales and Marketing
Our e-commerce portals are the heart of our marketing and sales strategy. Our strategy is to make these portals the primary place for integrators to research products, design projects, receive training and certifications, order products and receive ongoing support. We drive engagement with integrators via digital marketing campaigns, a multi-faceted integrator rewards program, high-quality content, and digital tools for training, research, management and other integrator needs.
To supplement this portal, we have invested in a multi-faceted sales and marketing organization that allocates effort across channel and sales teams based on the opportunity size of the integrator. We operate our sales effort through a combination of local branch sales personnel, outside sales representatives, and in-house sales development resources. In addition, our strong partner rewards program allows us to drive new integrator additions and increase integrator spend by providing spending and loyalty-based rewards such as free shipping, discounted pricing, advanced replacements and quarterly rebates.
We are active participants at global industry conferences and maintain a significant presence at Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association (“CEDIA”) trade shows.
Our Competition
The smart living market is fragmented, highly competitive and continually evolving. We compete against smart living point product companies such as Alarm.com, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Crestron, Logitech, Savant, Sonos and Ubiquiti. Many of these companies have significant market share, diversified product and service lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition, loyal customer bases and significant financial, marketing, research, development and other resources. Their presence in the market has increased consumer awareness for smart living solutions and has helped contribute to the robust growth of the entire market and demand for our integrated solutions. In a number of cases, our competitors are also our partners within our third-party product ecosystem, and their products are purchased by integrators through Snap One and integrate seamlessly into a professionally installed solution. We also compete with distributors in local markets who distribute product to professional integrators.
We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging smart-living-focused businesses. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. In particular, we may in the future compete with large technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader smart living market. Such companies may have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, 
marketing, distribution or other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In some instances, we may have commercial arrangements with technology or services providers in the connected home market with whom we may otherwise compete and our relationships with both our competitors and partners may change over time.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the smart living market include the following:
•simplicity and ease-of-use for both the integrator and end consumer;
•ability to offer a broad suite of products and comprehensive solutions;
•ability to provide efficient and timely distribution on an omni-channel basis;
•ability to provide secure access to wireless networks;
•ability to offer persistent awareness, control and intelligent automation;
•ability to provide quality product support;
•flexibility of the solutions and ability to customize for the end consumer;
•interoperability with a wide range of third-party devices;
•pricing, affordability and accessibility;
•network of integrators with local installation capabilities; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. In addition, we believe that our integrated platform of products and technology-enabled workflow solutions help to set us apart from our competitors.
Our Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 100 active issued patents and over 100 trademarks protecting our proprietary brands. We continue to review our product development and efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We also enter into commercial arrangements with our third-party product partners to provide integration with our ecosystem and sell their products through our e-commerce portal and local branch network.
Human Capital
Our employees are central to our vision of “bringing together people, integrators and products to deliver joy, connectivity and security in our everyday lives.” Everything we do begins with our people, and recruiting, developing and investing in top talent is critical to our success.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,492 full-time employees, including 336 in product development, 374 in sales and marketing, 607 in operations and 175 in general and administrative. Of the 336 employees on our product development team, 151 were software engineers. Of our full-time employees, 1,308 were in the United States and 184 were in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and/or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
We strive to foster a positive, collaborative and inclusive working environment that enables our people to thrive and our integrators to succeed. That is why we ask every person who joins Snap One to embrace our four company tenets:
•Be an Owner.
•Obsess over Customers.
•Be the Best Place to Work.
•Learn Every Day.
Consistent with our tenets, Snap One values diversity and belonging. Our solutions integrate thousands of unique products into smart homes and businesses, and similarly we believe that a truly innovative workforce should integrate employees with varied knowledge, experience and backgrounds to best promote innovation and growth. We rely on the differences in who we are, how we think and what we have experienced to create a greater sense of community. For example, our inclusion groups are company-sponsored groups of employees that support and promote certain mutual objectives of both the employees and the company, including inclusion and diversity and the professional development of employees. We also have a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council to promote our shared vision of equality and belonging. Our emphasis on treating people well creates an attractive culture for our employees and enables us to create exceptional experiences for our customers.
We strive to provide our employees with career development opportunities and resources that enable them to grow professionally. This helps us to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce by deepening employee engagement and enhancing the skills and competencies of our people. We use skills matrices in which employees’ demonstration of our Company tenets is assessed against the expectations for their current level of responsibility within the Company and potential future roles. Employees and their managers use the results of this assessment to evaluate the employees’ readiness to take on additional responsibility, to create and communicate individual development plans for employees and to identify opportunities that will position them for future professional growth. We supplement our rigorous criteria for assessing employees’ readiness for a promotion with input from a variety of sources, and we seek to create growth opportunities that go beyond promotions.
