ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
The Company is a technology-based developer and manufacturer of diversified lines of products and derives revenue from the production and sale of electronics for medical devices and other applications; environmentally safe chemical products for industrial, medical and cosmetic uses; and, research, development, regulatory and engineering services.
 
The Company is a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 24, 1969. Our operations are conducted through ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. ("ADM") and its subsidiary Sonotron Medical Systems, Inc. ("SMI").
 
COMPANY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
ELECTRONICS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS
 
We develop and manufacture electronic technologies for non-invasive, electrotherapeutic and diagnostic medical devices as well as for veterinary and other applications. The products are manufactured at our Northvale facility which is an FDA-Registered Medical Device Manufacturing facility. We develop and manufacture our own proprietary products as well as on a contract basis for other companies. 
CONTRACT MANUFACTURING 
 
The Company derives revenues from contract manufacturing of electronic medical and other devices from non-affiliated customers. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $320,000 of back-log for electronic products.
ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES
 
We develop, manufacture and sell chemical products to industrial users. Such products consist primarily of the following:
 

● | Water-based primers and adhesives;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Water-based coatings and resins;
--+---------------------------------


● | Water-based chemical additives; and
--+------------------------------------


● | Anti-static conductive paints, coating and other products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
Water-based primers and adhesives are chemical compounds used to bind different plastic films, metal foils and papers. Examples are the binding of polyethylene to polyester, nylon, vinyl, aluminum, polypropylene, paper and cellophane. Our water-based primers and adhesives are similar in function to solvent-based primers that are widely used to bind plastic films, papers and foils. Solvent-based systems have come under criticism since they have been found to be highly pollutant, dangerous to health and generally caustic in nature. Based upon our experience since 1969, including information furnished to us by certain of our customers, we believe that water-based systems have no known polluting effects and pose no known health hazards. There can, of course, be no assurance that any governmental restrictions will not be imposed on our water-based products or that such products will be accepted as replacements for solvent based products. 
 
 


Water-based coatings and resins for the printing industry are used to impart properties to the printed substrate. Our coatings and resins can be used to coat printed material for glossy or aesthetic appeal to make such material virtually impervious to certain types of grease and to impart other characteristics required or desired for various products and specifications.
 
Certain of our water-based chemical additives are used to impart properties to inks and other chemical products used in the food packaging and printing industries. These additives are used for their ability to improve the performance of such products.
 
Through Anti-Static Industries, the assets of which were acquired in July 2009, we now develop and manufacture a full-line of anti-static products for commercial and industrial use through a division of our company that we refer to as “Antistatic Industries”. Antistatic Industries develops and distributes proprietary conductive paints, coatings and other products and accessories which can be used by electronics, computer, pharmaceutical and chemical companies to prevent, reduce or eliminate static electricity. Many industries are concerned with static electricity as it can be hazardous to personnel and damage corporate facilities, computers, electronic equipment and valuable parts. Antistatic Industries has a wide range of products including paints, hoses, garments, floor mats, rugs, strapping, tapes, hook-and-loop, adhesive products and many other specialized items, all with conductive properties. Antistatic Industries has also pioneered low volatile organic compound conductive and antistatic paint and coating formulations that can be used as replacements for paints and coatings made from hazardous solvents. Antistatic Industries seeks to continually develop new products through research and development for new and current customers to aid in their quest for maximum protection with less waste and rejects in their manufacturing processes by reducing or eliminating static electricity.
 
None of our chemical products are protected by patents, although the names of some of such products have been protected by trademarks. We do not believe that any such trademarks are material to our business. As of March 31, 2018, the dollar amount of backlog orders for our chemical products believed by us to be firm was not material. 
 
MEDICAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS
 
The Company has developed several medical and cosmetic topical products. The Company’s proprietary water-based, adhesive and related topical formulations are used for maxillofacial prosthetic medical applications and for professional makeup applications primarily for special makeup effects for film, TV and theatrical productions. 
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY AND ENGINEERING SERVICES
 
The Company provides research, development, regulatory and engineering services to unaffiliated customers for the design, development and manufacturing of medical devices, electronics and other technologies and products (the “Engineering Services”). The Engineering Services are provided by the Company to customers both on a fee-for-services basis and on a project basis.
CUSTOMERS 
 
During the year ended March 31, 2018, three customers accounted for 58% of our net revenue. During the year ended March 31, 2017, one customer accounted for 59% of our net revenue. As of March 31, 2018, three customers accounted for 93% of our accounts receivable. As of March 31, 2017 one customer represented 83% of our accounts receivable. The loss of these major customers could have a material impact on our operations and cash flow.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
 
A majority of our product sales are distributed to customers directly from our headquarters in Northvale, NJ. Customers place purchase orders with us and products are then shipped via common carrier delivery on a "FOB shipping point" basis. A portion of the sales are accomplished through distributors who place purchase orders with us for certain quantities of our products which are shipped by common carrier to the distributor's respective warehouses. These stocking distributors then ship product to the ultimate customer via common carrier from their inventory of our products. Our contract manufacturing customers place orders with us for certain quantities of their products they desire to have us manufacture, typically providing a deposit with each order. Engineering Services are provided through written agreements with customers both on a fee-for-services basis and a project basis.
MANUFACTURER AND SUPPLIERS
 
MANUFACTURER
 
ADM manufactures its electronic and chemical products and SMI and other customers’ electronic products at its facilities located in Northvale, New Jersey.
 
ADM warranties the products it manufactures for SMI against defects in material and workmanship for a period of 90 days after the completion of manufacture. After such 90-day period, ADM has agreed to provide repair services for the products at its customary hourly repair rate plus the cost of any parts, components or items necessary to repair the products. 
 
Under contract manufacturing agreements, all inventions, patentable or otherwise, trade secrets, discoveries, ideas, writings, technology, know-how, improvements or other advances or findings relating to the entities' products and technologies shall be and become the exclusive proprietary and confidential information of such entity or any person to whom such entity may have assigned rights therein. ADM has no rights in any such proprietary or confidential information and is prohibited from using or disclosing any of such proprietary or confidential information for its own benefit or purposes, or for the benefit or purpose of any other person other than the entity without such entity's prior written consent. ADM has also agreed to cooperate with each entity in securing for it any patents, copyrights, trademarks or the like which it may seek to obtain in connection therewith. If ADM breaches any of the confidentiality agreements contained in the manufacturing agreement, or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect the entity's technology or are found to be unenforceable, the entity's competitors could acquire and use information that it considers to be our trade secrets and the entity may not be able to compete effectively.
 
Since ADM is the exclusive manufacturer of all of SMI's current and future products under the manufacturing agreement, if the operations of ADM are interrupted or if orders or orders of other customers of the Company exceed our manufacturing capabilities, we may not be able to deliver products on time and the entities may not be able to deliver their respective products to their respective customers on time. Under the terms of the manufacturing agreement, if ADM is unable to perform its obligations thereunder or is otherwise in breach of any provision thereof, SMI has the right, without penalty, to engage third parties to manufacture some or all of its products. In addition, if SMI elects to utilize a third-party manufacturer to supplement the manufacturing being completed by ADM, SMI has the right to require us to accept delivery of the products from these third-party manufacturers, finalize the manufacture of the products to the extent necessary to comply with FDA regulations and ensure that the design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process have been met.
 
As a manufacturer of medical devices, ADM is required to comply with quality requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. In addition, our manufacturing facility is required to be registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the FDA and is subject to inspection by the FDA. The Company has been registered by the FDA as a Registered Medical Device Establishment since 1988 allowing it to manufacture medical devices in accordance with procedures outlined in FDA regulations, which include quality control and related activities. Such registration is renewable annually and although we do not believe that the registration will fail to be renewed by the FDA, there can be no assurance of such renewal.
 
 


SUPPLIERS 
 
We purchase the raw materials, parts, components and other items required to manufacture our products. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for such raw materials, parts, components and other items. Although there are many suppliers for each of these raw materials, parts, components and other items, we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many of the significant raw materials and components due to our customers’ requirements. We do not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers. The failure to maintain existing relationships with suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect our ability to obtain raw materials and components used in the products in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from our existing suppliers or alternative sources of supply, we may be unable to satisfy orders which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect relationships with our customers.  Accordingly, in order to satisfy its customers' needs, we have maintained an inventory ranging, in dollar amounts, from 15% to 30% of sales of chemical products in the form of either raw materials or finished goods.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
During our fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses with respect to company-sponsored research and development activities were approximately $527,659 and $168,812 respectively. During such fiscal years, we did not expend any funds on customer-sponsored research and development activities with respect thereto, other than contracted research and development from engineering services customers.
COMPETITION
 
Our businesses are highly competitive and substantially all of our competitors possess greater experience, financial resources, operating history and marketing capabilities than us. Although we do not believe that there are one or more dominant competitors in such industries, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete with any or all of our competitors on the basis of price, service or otherwise. Competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions and throughout the economy as a whole. In addition, current and anticipated future consolidation among our competitors and customers may cause us to lose market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. Furthermore, there is a trend in industry toward relocation of manufacturing facilities to lower-cost regions such as Asia. Such relocation may permit some of our competitors to lower their costs and improve their competitive position. If we do not compete successfully, our business, operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected.
 
Our results of operations depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings. We are committed to remaining a competitive producer and believe that our portfolio of new or re-engineered products is strong. However, we may not be able to develop new products, re-engineer existing products successfully or bring them to be competitive, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain customers to which we sell our products.
 
INSURANCE
 
The Company may be exposed to potential product liability claims by those who use our products. Therefore, we maintain a general liability insurance policy, which includes aggregate product liability coverage of $3,000,000 for certain of our products. We believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate for the types of products we currently market. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of March 31, 2018, we had 19 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees. As of such date, we had one salaried employee in an executive or managerial position. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

ADM TRONICS UNLIMITED, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017
 

 NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS
 
ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. ("we", "us", "the Company" or "ADM"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on  November 24, 1969. We are a manufacturing and engineering concern whose principal lines of business are the design, manufacture and sale of electronics of our own products or on a contract manufacturing basis; the production and sale of chemical and antistatic products; and, research, development and engineering services.
 
Electronic equipment is manufactured in accordance with customer specifications on a contract basis. Our electronic device product line consists principally of proprietary devices used in diagnostics and therapeutics of humans and animals and electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. These products are sold to customers located principally in the United States. We are registered with the FDA as a contract manufacturing facility and we manufacture medical devices for customers in accordance with their designs and specifications. Our chemical product line is principally comprised of water-based chemical products used in the food packaging and converting industries, and anti-static conductive paints, coatings and other products. These products are sold to customers located in the United States, Australia, Asia and Europe. We also provide research, development, regulatory and engineering services to customers. Our Sonotron Medical Systems, Inc. subsidiary (“Sonotron”) is involved in medical electronic therapeutic technology.



 NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc. and its subsidiary Sonotron (the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, accordingly, require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates made by management include expected economic life and value of our deferred tax assets, valuation allowance, impairment of long lived assets, fair value of equity instruments for services, allowance for doubtful accounts, and warranty reserves. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
For certain of our financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times,  may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses to date as a result of this policy. Cash and cash equivalents held in these accounts are currently insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to a maximum of $250,000 per institution. At  March 31, 2018, approximately $1,438,000 exceeded the FDIC limit. 
 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
 
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management's best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. Management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances that exceed the due date and estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that will not be collected. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to expenses and a credit to a valuation allowance, based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Allowance for doubtful accounts was increased for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2018 to $125,000, up from $25,000 for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2017.
 
 F-6



REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
ELECTRONICS:
 
We recognize revenue from the sale of our electronic products when they are shipped to the purchaser. We offer a limited 90-day warranty on our electronics products and contract manufacturing and a limited 5-year warranty on our electronic controllers for spas and hot tubs. We have no other post shipment obligations. Based on prior experience, no amounts have been accrued for potential warranty costs and actual costs were less than $2,000, for each of the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2018 and 2017. For contract manufacturing, revenues are recognized after shipment of the completed products.
 
CHEMICAL PRODUCTS:
 
Revenues are recognized when products are shipped to end users. Shipments to distributors are recognized as revenue when no right of return exists.
 
ENGINEERING SERVICES
 
We provide certain engineering services, including research, development, quality control and quality assurance services along with regulatory compliance services. We recognize revenue from engineering services as the services are provided.
WARRANTY LIABILITIES
 
The Company’s provision for estimated future warranty costs is based upon historical relationship of warranty claims to sales. Based upon historical experience, the Company has concluded that no warranty liability is required as of the consolidated balance sheet dates. However, the Company periodically reviews the adequacy of its product warranties and will record an accrued warranty reserve if necessary.
INVENTORIES
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Inventories that are expected to be sold within one operating cycle (1 year) are classified as a current asset. Inventories that are not expected to be sold within 1 year, based on historical trends, are classified as Inventories - long term portion. Obsolete inventory is written off annually.
 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
We record our property and equipment at historical cost. We expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation is provided for by the straight-line method over five to seven years, the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment.
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the Company compares the carrying value of the relevant asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets’ fair value and its carrying value. 
 
 F-7



ADVERTISING COSTS 
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $62,297 and $46,129 for the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS 
 
Shipping and handling costs incurred for the years ended  March 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $2,904 and $6,092, respectively. Such costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
We report the results of our operations as part of a consolidated Federal tax return with our subsidiary. Deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to that portion that is expected to more likely than not be realized.
 
The Company has adopted the authoritative accounting guidance with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which clarified the accounting and disclosures for uncertain tax positions related to income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements and addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
 
The Company files income tax returns in several jurisdictions. The Company’s tax returns remain subject to examination, by major jurisdiction, for the years ended  March 31, as follows:
 
 
Jurisdiction | Fiscal Year 
-------------+----------------
Federal | 2014 and beyond
New Jersey | 2013 and beyond



There are currently no tax years under examination by any major tax jurisdictions.
 
The Company will recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of  March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
 
NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income/loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential shares had been issued and if the additional shares were dilutive. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of net earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.
 
Per share basic and diluted net income amounted to $(0.00) and $0.02 for the fiscal years ended  March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
 
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
Effective  April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective method. This guidance supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The Company has drafted its accounting policy for the new standard based on a detailed review of its business and contracts. Based on the new guidance, the Company expects to continue recognizing revenue at the time it’s products are shipped, and therefore adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, and is not expected to have a material impact in the future. The Company anticipates it will expand its financial statement disclosures in order to comply with the disclosure requirements of the ASC 606 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
 
In  July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 - 11, “ Inventory. Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” This amendment requires companies to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company adopted this amendment in  April of 2017, and the implementation did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
 F-8



In  February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases”, which is intended to improve financial reporting for lease transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets, such as real estate and manufacturing equipment, to recognize both assets and liabilities on their balance sheet for the rights to use those assets for the lease term and obligations to make the lease payments created by those leases that have terms of greater than 12 months. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as finance or operating lease. This ASU will also require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount and timing of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures will include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. This ASU was adopted by the Company in  April of 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
In  June 2016, the FASB issued ASU-2016-13 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses”. This guidance affects organizations that hold financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income. The guidance requires organizations to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2019. The Company is evaluating the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
In  February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement- Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” This guidance gives businesses the option of reclassifying to retained earnings the so-called “stranded tax effects” left in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This amendment is effective for all organizations for fiscal years beginning after  December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is allowed. We do not believe that this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncement, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES
 
At  March 31, 2018, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards, (NOL’s) of approximately $1,973,000, which are due to expire through fiscal 2033. These NOLs  may be used to offset future taxable income through their respective expiration dates and thereby reduce or eliminate our federal and state income taxes otherwise payable. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Ultimate utilization of such NOL’s and credits is dependent upon the Company’s ability to generate taxable income in future periods and  may be significantly curtailed if a significant change in ownership occurs.
 
Significant components of deferred tax assets are as follows as of March 31, 2018 and 2017:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 |
