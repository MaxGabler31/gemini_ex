ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that improve the quality of life for downstream consumers and promote a sustainable future. Our products comprise a broad range of innovative chemicals and formulations that bring color and vibrancy to buildings, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption. We market our products globally to a diversified group of industrial customers through two segments: Titanium Dioxide, which consists of our TiO2 business, and Performance Additives, which consists of our functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including TiO2, color pigments and functional additives, a leading North American producer of timber treatment products and a leading European producer of water treatment products. We operate 24 manufacturing facilities, employ approximately 4,300 associates worldwide and sell our products in more than 110 countries.

We operate in a variety of end markets, including industrial and architectural coatings, construction materials, plastics, paper, printing inks, pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, fibers and films and personal care. Within these end markets, our products serve approximately 4,800 customers globally. Our production capabilities allow us to manufacture a broad range of functional TiO2 products as well as specialty TiO2 products that provide critical performance for our customers and sell at a premium for certain end-use applications. Our color pigments, functional additives and timber treatment products provide essential properties for our customers’ end-use applications by enhancing the color and appearance of construction materials and delivering performance benefits in other applications such as corrosion and fade resistance, water repellence and flame suppression. We believe that our global footprint and broad product offerings differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to better meet our customers’ needs.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had total revenues of $2,265 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $436 million, comprised of $417 million from our Titanium Dioxide segment and $62 million from our Performance Additives segment.
Our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments have been transformed in recent years and we have a well-established position in each of the industries in which we operate. We continue to implement additional business improvements within our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives businesses which will continue to provide incremental improvements in our earnings as these programs are achieved.
The table below summarizes the key products, end markets and applications, representative customers, revenues and sales information by segment as of December 31, 2018.

Recent Developments
Potential Acquisition of Tronox European Paper Laminates Business
On July 16, 2018, we announced that we reached an agreement with Tronox Limited (“Tronox”) to purchase the European paper laminates business (the “8120 Grade”) from Tronox upon the closing of their proposed merger with The National Titanium Dioxide Company Limited ("Cristal"). In connection with the acquisition, Tronox would supply the 8120 Grade to us under a Transitional Supply Agreement until the transfer of the manufacturing of the 8120 Grade to our Greatham, U.K., facility has been completed.
Pori Fire
5

On January 30, 2017, our TiO2 manufacturing facility in Pori, Finland, experienced fire damage. The loss was covered by insurance for property damage as well as business interruption losses subject to retained deductibles of $15 million and 60 days, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $371 million of income related to insurance recoveries in cost of goods sold while $187 million was recognized in 2017. The Pori facility had a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons per year, which represented approximately 17% of our total TiO2 nameplate capacity and approximately 2% of total global TiO2 demand. Prior to the fire, 60% of the site capacity produced specialty products which, on average, contributed greater than 75% of the site EBITDA from January 1, 2015 through January 30, 2017. We have restored 20% of the total prior capacity, which is dedicated to production of specialty products.
On September 12, 2018, following our review of the Pori facility and options within our manufacturing network, and as a result of unanticipated cost escalation and extended timeline associated with reconstruction, we announced that we intend to close our Pori, Finland, TiO2 manufacturing facility and transfer the specialty and differentiated product grades to other sites. We intend to continue to operate the Pori facility at reduced production rates through the transition period, which is expected to last through at least 2022, subject to economic and other factors. We currently plan to transfer certain technology and the production of select product grades, namely for inks, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food grade applications, from Pori to other sites within our network. In addition, and as market conditions warrant, we intend to strengthen the existing manufacturing network by increasing its efficiency and by providing greater manufacturing flexibility. Please see "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-We may be unsuccessful in our announced intentions to close the Pori, Finland site and transfer specialty and differentiated production to other sites within our manufacturing network within the anticipated timeframe and we may not experience the full anticipated benefits of our transfer and strengthen program."
Our Business
We manufacture TiO2, functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment products. Our broad product range, coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. We are a leader in the specialty and differentiated TiO2 industry segments, which includes products that sell at a premium and have more stable margins. We also have complementary functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We have 24 manufacturing facilities operating in 10 countries with a total nameplate production capacity of approximately 1.2 million metric tons per year. We operate eight TiO2 manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia and 16 color pigments, functional additives, water treatment and timber treatment manufacturing and processing facilities in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues were $2,265 million. 
Titanium Dioxide Segment
TiO2 is derived from titanium-bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items, including coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers, food and personal care products. We own a portfolio of brands including the TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC®, UVTITAN® and ALTIRIS® ranges, which are produced in our eight manufacturing facilities around the globe. We service over 1,600 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. Our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global customers, including A. Schulman, AkzoNobel, Ampacet, BASF, Clariant, DSM, Flint, PPG, PolyOne, Sherwin-Williams and Sun Chemical.
We are among the largest global TiO2 producers, with nameplate production capacity of approximately 652,000 metric tons per year. We are able to manufacture a broad range of TiO2 products for functional, differentiated and specialty applications. Our specialty and differentiated product grades generally sell at a premium into more specialized applications such as fibers, catalysts, food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. 
There are two manufacturing processes for the production of TiO2; the sulfate process and the chloride process. We believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately 45% of global production capacity. Most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing route—for example, the inks market prefers sulfate products and the automotive coatings market prefers chloride products. Regional customers typically favor products that are available locally. The sulfate process produces TiO2 in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty applications. Our production capabilities are distinguished from some of our competitors because of our ability to manufacture TiO2 using both sulfate and chloride manufacturing processes, which gives us the flexibility to tailor our products to meet our customers’ needs. By operating both sulfate and chloride processes, we also have the ability to use a wide range of titanium feedstocks, which enhances the competitiveness of our manufacturing operations, by providing flexibility in the selection of raw materials. This helps insulate us from price fluctuations for any particular feedstock and allows us to manage our raw material costs. 
6

Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced using either the chloride or sulfate process, it is “finished” into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. Co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal to comply with environmental regulations. In order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our Titanium Dioxide segment. We sell approximately 60% of the co-products generated by our business.

We have an established broad customer base and have successfully differentiated ourselves by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche market segments where the innovation and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships.

 | Rutile TiO2 | Anatase TiO2 | Nano TiO2 
Characteristics | Most common form of TiO2. Harder and more durable crystal | Softer, less abrasive pigment, preferred for some specialty applications | Very small particles of either rutile or anatase TiO2 (typically less than 100nm in diameter)
Applications | Coatings, printing inks, PVC window frames, plastic masterbatches | Cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, polyester fibers, polyamide fibers | Catalysts and cosmetics 

Performance Additives Segment
Functional Additives. Functional additives are barium and zinc based inorganic chemicals used to make colors more brilliant, coatings shine, plastic more stable and protect products from fading. We are one of the leading global manufacturer of zinc and barium functional additives. The demand dynamics of functional additives are closely aligned with those of functional TiO2 given the overlap in applications served, including coatings and plastics.

Color Pigments. We are a leading global producer of colored inorganic pigments for the construction, coatings, plastics and specialty markets. We are one of three global leaders in the manufacture and processing of liquid, powder and granulated forms of iron oxide color pigments. We also sell natural and synthetic inorganic pigments and metal carboxylate driers. The cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength of iron oxide make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings and plastics. We produce a wide range of color pigments and are the world’s second largest manufacturer of technical grade ultramarine blue pigments, which have a unique blue shade and are widely used to correct colors, giving them a desirable clean, blue undertone. These attributes have resulted in ultramarine blue being used world-wide for polymeric applications such as construction plastics, food packaging, automotive polymers, consumer plastics, coatings and cosmetics.
Our products are sold under a portfolio of brands that are targeted to the construction sector such as DAVIS COLORS®, GRANUFIN® and FERROXIDE® and the following brands HOLLIDAY PIGMENTS, COPPERAS RED® and MAPICO® focused predominantly on the coatings and plastics sectors.
Our products are also used by manufacturers of colorants, rubber, paper, cosmetics, pet food, digital ink, toner and other industrial uses delivering benefits in other applications such as corrosion protection and catalysis.

Iron oxide pigment’s cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings such as paints and plastics. We are one of the three largest synthetic inorganic color pigments producers which together represent more than 50% of the global market for iron oxide pigments. The remaining market share consists primarily of competitors based in China.

Made from clay, our ultramarine blue pigments are non-toxic, weather resistant and thermally stable. Ultramarine blue is used world-wide for food contact applications and is used extensively in plastics and the paint industry. Our synthetic ultramarines are permitted for unrestricted use in certain cosmetics applications. We focus on supplying our customers with technical grade ultramarine blues and violets to high specification markets such as the cosmetics industry.
Copperas, iron and alkali are raw materials for the manufacture of iron oxide pigments. They are used to produce colored pigment particles which are further processed into a finished pigment in powder, liquid, granule or blended powder form.

Timber Treatment and Water Treatment. We manufacture wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications to prolong the service life of wood through protection from decay and fungal or insect attack. Wood that has been treated with our products is sold to consumers through major branded retail outlets.
We manufacture our timber treatment chemicals in the U.S. and market our products primarily in North America through Viance, LLC (“Viance”), our 50%-owned joint venture with Dow Chemical (now “DowDuPont”). Our residential construction products such as ACQ, ECOLIFE™ and Copper Azole are sold for use in decking, fencing and other residential outdoor wood structures. Our industrial construction products such as Chromated Copper Arsenate are sold for use in telephone poles and salt water piers and pilings.
We manufacture our water treatment chemicals in Germany, and these products are used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications. We are one of Europe’s largest suppliers of polyaluminium chloride-based flocculants with approximately 140,000 metric tons of production capacity. Our main markets are municipal and industrial waste water treatment and the paper industry.
Customers, Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Titanium Dioxide Segment
8

We serve over 1,600 customers through our Titanium Dioxide segment. These customers produce paints and coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers and films, pharmaceuticals, food and cosmetics.
Our ten largest customers accounted for 21% of the segment’s sales in 2018 and no single TiO2 customer represented more than 10% of our sales in 2018. Approximately 85% of our TiO2 sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network. This network enables us to work directly with our customers and develop a deep understanding of our customers’ needs and to develop valuable relationships. The remaining 15% of sales are made through our distribution network. We maximize the reach of our distribution network by utilizing specialty distributors in selected markets.
Larger customers are typically served via our own sales network and these customers often have annual volume targets with associated pricing mechanisms. Smaller customers are served through a combination of our global sales teams and a distribution network, and the route to market decision is often dependent upon customer size and end application.
Our focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. For example, we believe that our Titanium Dioxide segment is well-positioned to benefit from growth sectors, such as fibers and films, catalysts, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food, where customers’ needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. We maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected markets. Our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products.
Performance Additives Segment
We serve over 3,500 customers through our Performance Additives segment. These customers produce materials for the construction industry, as well as coatings, plastics, pharmaceutical, personal care and catalyst applications.
Our ten largest customers accounted for 20% of the segment’s sales in 2018 and no single Performance Additives customer represented more than 10% of our sales in 2018. Performance Additives segment sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network, in addition to utilizing specialty distributors. Our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products. We sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through specialty distributors. We sell the majority of our timber treatment products directly to end customers via our joint venture Viance.

Joint Ventures
LPC is our 50%-owned joint venture with Kronos. We share production offtake and operating costs of the plant with Kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. The operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. Our investment in LPC is accounted for using the equity method.
Viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with DowDuPont. Viance markets our timber treatment products. Our joint venture interest in Viance was acquired as part of the Rockwood acquisition. The joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our Harrisburg, North Carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on Viance’s behalf. As a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and as a result, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and operating results of Viance into our consolidated financial statements.
Pacific Iron Products Sdn Bhd ("PIP") is our 50%-owned joint venture with Coogee Chemicals Pty. Ltd. that manufactures products for Venator. It was determined that the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance are raw material supply, manufacturing and sales. In this joint venture we supply all the raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers. 
10

Through a fixed price raw materials supply contract with the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. We concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and as a result we consolidate the assets, liabilities and operating results of PIP into our consolidated financial statements.
Raw Materials
Titanium Dioxide Segment
The primary raw materials that are used to produce TiO2 are various types of titanium feedstock, which include ilmenite, rutile, titanium slag (chloride slag and sulfate slag) and synthetic rutile. The world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the four largest accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. The majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from Canada, Africa, Norway and India. Ore accounts for approximately 50% of TiO2 variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 32% of variable manufacturing costs.
The majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per year. This form of market-based ore contract provides flexibility and responsiveness in terms of pricing and quantity obligations. We expect that there may be increases in raw material costs in our Titanium Dioxide segment in the near term.
Performance Additives Segment
Our primary raw materials for our Performance Additives segment are as follows:

 | FunctionalAdditives | Color Pigments | TimberTreatment | WaterChemicals
Primary raw materials | Barium and zinc based inorganics | Iron oxide particles, scrap iron, copperas, alkali | DCOIT, copper, monoethanolamine | Aluminum oxide


The primary raw materials for functional additives production are barite and zinc. We currently source material barite from China, where we have long standing supplier relationships and pricing is negotiated largely on a purchase by purchase basis. The quality of zinc required for our business is mainly mined in Australia but can also be sourced from Canada and South America. The majority of our zinc is sourced from two key suppliers with whom we have long standing relationships.
We source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from China, the U.S., France and Italy. Key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis.
The primary raw materials for our timber treatment business are dichloro-octylisothiazolinone (“DCOIT”) and copper. We source the raw materials for the majority of our timber treatment business from China and the U.S. DCOIT is sourced on a long-term contract whereas copper is procured from various mid-size and larger producers primarily on a spot contract basis.
The primary raw materials for our water treatment business are aluminum hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which are widely available from a number of sources and typically sourced through long-term contracts. We also use sulfuric acid which we source internally.
Competition
The global markets in which our business operates are highly competitive and vary according to segment.
Titanium Dioxide Segment
Competition within the functional grade TiO2 market is based on price, product quality and service. Our key competitors are The Chemours Company, Tronox Limited, Kronos Worldwide Inc. and the National Titanium Dioxide Company ("Cristal") each of which is a major global producer with the ability to service all global markets and Lomon Billions, a Chinese TiO2 producer with global sales. The sulfate based TiO2 technology used by our Titanium Dioxide segment is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low. The entrance of new competitors 
11

into the industry, the ability of existing or future competitors to increase production in low cost markets, and the development of proprietary technology that enables current or future competitors to produce functional grade products at a significantly lower cost, could render our technology uneconomic and reduce our ability to capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 
Competition within the specialty TiO2 market is based on technical expertise in the customers’ applications, customer service, product attributes (such as product form and quality), and price. Product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. Our primary competitors within specialty and differentiated TiO2 include Fuji Titanium Industry, Kronos Worldwide Inc., ISK, Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Tayca Corporation and Precheza.
Performance Additives Segment
Competition within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and price. Key competitors for barium-based additives include Solvay S.A., Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., 20 Microns Ltd., and various Chinese barium producers. Key competitors for zinc-based additives include various Chinese lithopone producers.
Our primary competitors within color pigments include Lanxess AG, Cathay Pigments Group, Ferro Corporation and Shanghai Yipin Pigments Co., Ltd.
Competition within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology, including sustainable solutions and product range. Our primary competitors are Lonza Group and Koppers Inc. Competition within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. Our primary competitors are Kemira Oyj and Feralco Group.
Intellectual Property
Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. When appropriate, we file patent and trademark applications, often on a global basis, for new product development technologies. For example, we have obtained patents and trademark registrations covering relevant jurisdictions for our new solar reflecting technologies (ALTIRIS® pigments) that are used to keep colored surfaces cooler when they are exposed to the sun. We own a total of approximately 954 issued patents and pending patent applications and 943 trademark registrations and applications for registration. Our patent portfolio includes approximately 56 issued U.S. patents, 629 patents issued in countries outside the U.S., and 269 pending patent applications, worldwide.
We hold numerous patents and, while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner.
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.
In addition to our own patents, patent applications, proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties.
Certain of our products are well-known brand names. Some of these registrations and applications include filings under the Madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. In our Titanium Dioxide segment, we consider our TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC®, UVTITAN®, HOMBIKAT™, DELTIO® and ALTIRIS® trademarks to be valuable 
12

assets. In our Performance Additives segment, we consider BLANC FIXE™, GRANUFIN®, SACHTOLITH®, FERROXIDE®, ECOLIFE™ and NICASAL® trademarks to be valuable assets.
Please also see the section entitled “Part III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
General
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In the U.S., these laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), as well as the state counterparts of these statutes.
In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether. In addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to EHS matters may also be found in other areas of this report including “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 22. Commitments and Contingencies —Other Proceedings and Note 23. Environmental, Health and Safety Matters.”
We are subject to a wide array of laws governing chemicals, including the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) in the U.S., the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) in Europe and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (“CLP”) regulation in Europe. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan. In addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the U.K., have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. Many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for these rules. For example, the Globally Harmonised System (“GHS”) established a uniform system for the classification, labeling and packaging of certain chemical substances and the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) is currently in the process of determining if certain chemicals should be proposed to the European Commission to receive a carcinogenic classification.
Certain of our products are being evaluated under CLP regulation and their classification could negatively impact sales. On May 31, 2016, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (“ANSES”) submitted a proposal to ECHA that would classify TiO2 as a Category 1B Carcinogen classification presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans by inhalation. We, together with other companies, relevant trade associations and the European Chemical Industry Council (“Cefic”), submitted comments opposing any classification of TiO2 as carcinogenic, based on evidence from multiple epidemiological studies covering more than 24,000 production workers at 18 TiO2 manufacturing sites over several decades that found no increased incidence of lung cancer as a result of workplace exposure to TiO2 and other scientific studies that concluded that the response to lung overload studies with poorly soluble particles upon which the ANSES proposed classification is based is unique to the rat and is not seen in other animal species or humans. On June 8, 2017, ECHA’s Committee for Risk Assessment (“RAC”) announced its conclusion that certain evidence meets the criteria under CLP to classify TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen (described by the EU regulation as appropriate for “suspected human carcinogens”) for humans by inhalation, but found such evidence not sufficiently convincing to classify TiO2 in Category 1B (“presumed” to have carcinogenic potential for humans), as was originally proposed by ANSES. The RAC formally adopted the conclusion on September 14, 2017. The European Commission is currently evaluating the RAC report and deciding what, if any, regulatory measures should be taken. We, Cefic and others expect to continue to advocate with the European Commission that the RAC’s report should not justify other than alternative, proportionate regulatory measures for the reasons stated above, among others. The European Commission is likely to reach a determination on whether to progress the classification during the first quarter of 2019. If the European Commission were to subsequently adopt the Category 2

Carcinogen classification, it could require that many end-use products manufactured with TiO2 be classified as containing a potential carcinogenic component, which could negatively impact public perception of products containing TiO2, limit the marketability of and demand for TiO2 or products containing TiO2 and potentially have spill-over, restrictive effects under other EU laws, e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives. Such a classification could also require that all waste containing greater than 1% TiO2 be handled as hazardous waste, thus resulting in significant impacts on our customers’ products, wastes from our operations and the implementation of Circular Economy efforts within the EU. Such classifications would also affect manufacturing operations by subjecting us to new workplace safety requirements that could significantly increase costs. Finally, the classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen could lead the ECHA to evaluate other products with similar particle size characteristics such as iron oxides or functional additives for carcinogenic potential by inhalation for humans as well, which may ultimately have similar negative impacts to other of our products if classified as potentially carcinogenic. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Systems
We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. We cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage EHS legal requirements without incurring substantial costs. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us.
Environmental Remediation
We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. Based on available information, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost to remediate contaminated sites.
We are in the process of closing several facilities in the EU and we will be required to make a detailed assessment of the environmental status of these facilities as part of the closure processes. The assessment of the environmental status may lead to a requirement for environmental remediation as a part of any closure process. Based on available information, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Under CERCLA and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property in the U.S. may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. Outside the U.S., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in the EU, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. We have not been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at former facilities or third-party sites, including, but not limited to, sites listed under CERCLA.
Under the RCRA in the U.S. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit. Some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. We are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. Similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing facilities.
During 2018, China implemented new laws and regulations covering environmental contamination and created the Ministry for Environment Protection. Based on available information we do not believe that these regulatory changes will have a material effect on our financial statements.
Climate Change
Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. At the Durban 
14

negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the EU, agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the EU GHG Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions in the EU, continues in its third phase. The European Parliament has used a process to formalize “backloading”—the withholding of GHG allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices. As backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. The European Commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience. The reserve will start operating in 2019. In addition, the EU has announced the binding target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. The EU has set a binding target of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU’s energy consumption by 2030, and additional proposals have been made to increase the target to 35%.
In addition, at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, the U.S. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which entered into effect in November 2016 (the “Paris Agreement”). Although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017 the U.S. informed the United Nations that it is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four year exit process.
Federal climate change legislation in the U.S. appears unlikely in the near‑term. As a result, domestic efforts to curb GHG emissions will continue to be led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) GHG regulations and similar programs of certain states. To the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the EPA’s GHG regulations and/or state GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the CAA’s requirements for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs. Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs.
We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to U.S. federal and state requirements, Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or ETS requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that GHG emission restrictions may increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other extreme climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. For example, our operations in low lying areas may be at increased risk due to flooding, rising sea levels or disruption of operations from more frequent and severe weather events.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,300 associates in our operations around the world. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
We place considerable value on the involvement of our associates and ensure that we keep them informed on matters affecting them, the overall organization as well as on the performance of the Company. 
We conduct formal and informal meetings with associates, and maintain a Company intranet website with key information and other matters of interest.

We are committed to a policy of recruitment and promotion on the basis of competence and ability without discrimination of any kind. Management actively pursues both the employment of disabled persons whenever a suitable vacancy arises and the continued employment and retraining of associates who become disabled while employed by the Company. Training and development are undertaken for all associates, including disabled persons.
