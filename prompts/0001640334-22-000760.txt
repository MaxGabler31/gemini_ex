General Overview

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 30, 2007 under the name “Utalk Communications Inc.”. At inception, we were a development stage corporation engaged in the business of developing and marketing a call-back service using a call-back platform. Because we were not successful in implementing our business plan, we considered various alternatives to ensure the viability and solvency of our company.

On August 31, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent with Nevada Lithium regarding a business combination which may be effected in one of several different ways, including an asset acquisition, merger of our company and Nevada Lithium, or a share exchange whereby we would purchase the shares of Nevada Lithium from its shareholders in exchange for restricted shares of our common stock.

Effective September 30, 2009, we effected a 1 old for 60 new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and our issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,470,000 shares of common stock to 268,200,000 shares of common stock.

Also effective September 30, 2009, we changed our name from “Utalk Communications, Inc.” to “Lithium Corporation”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Lithium Corporation, which was formed solely for the change of name. The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on October 1, 2009 under the stock symbol “LTUM”. Our CUSIP number is 536804 107.

On October 9, 2009, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Nevada Lithium and the shareholders of Nevada Lithium. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the share exchange agreement and the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock in the capital of Nevada Lithium occurred on October 19, 2009. In accordance with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued 12,350,000 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Nevada Lithium in exchange for the acquisition, by our company, of all of the 12,350,000 issued and outstanding shares of Nevada Lithium. Also, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, a director of our company cancelled 220,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. Nevada Lithium’s corporate status was allowed to lapse and the company’s status with the Nevada Secretary of State has been revoked.

In June 2009 we optioned the Fish Lake Valley property in Esmeralda County Nevada, and ultimately earned a 100% interest in the property through a combination of exploration expenditures and share issuances. Lithium Corporation performed geophysical, geochemical and drilling work in the area into early 2016 at which time we entered into an agreement with the forerunner of American Lithium Corporation (TSX-V:Li) who could have earned an undivided 80% interest (with the residual 20% interest being purchasable post earn-in) in the property by incurring exploration expenses, making cash and share payments over a period of three years. American Lithium relinquished all interest in the property/option agreement in April 2019. In April 2021 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Altura Mining Limited whereby Altura (now Morella Corporation ASX:1MC, OTC-QB: ALTAF) may earn a 60% interest in the property by incurring exploration expenses, and making staged cash and share payments to Lithium Corporation over the next four years. Morella Corporation is the single largest shareholder in Lithium Corporation with over 10%, having acquired an interest through a non-brokered private placement in the Company in 2012. Subsequent to the initial consideration share issue for the Fish Lake Valley transaction Lithium Corporation is now in the top 20 shareholders of Morella.

In 2010 the Company acquired the San Emidio property through the staking of claims on open Bureau of Land Management administered Federal land in Washoe County Nevada. The company conducted geochemical, geophysical and drilling work over the next several years, and eventually optioned them off to American Lithium Corporation in May 2016 for a combination of exploration work, cash and share payments over the following three years. American Lithium allowed the option to lapse in 2018. In September 2021 Surge Battery Metals (TSX-V: Nili) entered into an option to earn an 80% interest in the property by incurring exploration expenses and making staged cash and share payments over the next five years.

In June 2013, we purchased a claim in the Sugar Lake area of British Columbia for 250,000 shares of our common stock. Known as the BC Sugar Property this property has expanded and contracted over time as we allowed a number of the less prospective claims to lapse. In January, 2014, we agreed to buy back the shares issued pursuant to the June 2013 agreement for $2,500. After doing considerable work up until spring 2019 all but approximately 203 acres (82.33 Hectares) of claims were allowed to lapse, and the property sat dormant. The market for flake graphite is improving, and the Company’s holdings here are currently approximately 2,947 acres (1,192.61 hectares), and we are planning a work program here this year. 

Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold 25%, and are active “Managing Members”. Our company’s initial capital contribution to Summa, LLC was $125,000, of which $100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date we have contributed an additional $31,700 in cash, and also over the years an indeterminate amount of casual geological expertise to Summa, LLC. In recognition, Summa transferred five urban lots in Tonopah of indeterminate value in 2020, and since Jan 2021 have issued checks to the company for $138,000. The Tonopah property was optioned in early 2020, and the Optionee has earned a 100% interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1% (LTUM’s share 0.25%) Net Smelter Royalty on the property, as well as other interests around the state of Nevada.

In April of 2016, our Company established a wholly owned subsidiary called Lithium Royalty Corp. The subsidiary was a Nevada Corporation and was the entity through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties. Also that April Lithium Royalty Corp acquired through staking the North Big Smoky Prospect, a block of placer mineral claims in Nye County Nevada. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100% of the interest in the North Big Smoky property through a Property Acquisition Agreement with 1069934 Nevada Ltd. (“Purchaser”) a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of mainly of 300,000 shares in the “Purchaser Parent”, 1069934 B.C. Ltd.  By agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp. and compensation under the agreement was received on November 2, 2017. The North Big Smoky claims were abandoned by the Purchaser in 2017 and recently the Company has re-staked claims in the general area. 

On February 16, 2017, we issued a news release announcing that we had signed a letter of intent with Nevada Sunrise Gold Corp., (“NEV” (TSX-V - NEV, OTC - NVSGF)) with respect to our Salt Wells lithium-in-brine prospect located in Churchill County Nevada. Under the terms of the agreement NEV was to earn a 100% interest in the property subject to a 2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR), and by making staged payments of cash and shares over the next two years. Issues arose with respect to the claim block and Nevada Sunrise’s understanding of the placement of the block, and ultimately it was determined that the Company would be best served by cancelling the agreement and refunding the money (minus bank fees) that Nevada Sunrise had sent. An informal letter agreement releasing the parties of all obligations save for the Area of Mutual Interest clause was executed by both parties on May 5, 2017 and funds in the amount of $24,950 were returned to NEV. The company no longer has any claims in this area.

Our Current Business

We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals with a focus on lithium mineralization on properties located in Nevada, and graphite and other energy metals properties in British Columbia.

Our current operational focus is to conduct generative exploration activities in Nevada, and on our titanium/REE and graphite properties, in British Columbia. 

In April of 2016, our Company established a wholly owned subsidiary called Lithium Royalty Corp. The subsidiary was a Nevada Corporation and was the entity through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties. Also that April Lithium Royalty Corp acquired through staking the North Big Smoky Prospect, a block of placer mineral claims in Nye County Nevada. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100% of the interest in the North Big Smoky Property through a Property Acquisition Agreement with 1069934 Nevada Ltd. (“Purchaser”) a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of mainly of 300,000 shares in the “Purchaser Parent”, 1069934 B.C. Ltd.  By agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp (successor corporation) and the North Big Smoky claims were allowed to lapse. This area was subsequently re-staked by Lithium Corporation in March 2022. 

On September 16th 2021 Lithium Corporation signed an agreement with Surge Battery Metals whereby Surge may earn an 80% interest in the Company’s San Emidio lithium-in-brine prospect in Washoe County Nevada, by paying an initial $50,000 and issuing 200,000 shares of Surge (TSX-V:Nili). Surge has undertaken to incur expenditures on the property of:
Year 1 – $100,000
Year 2 – cumulative total of, $250,000
Year 3 – cumulative total of, $400,000
Year 4 – cumulative total of, $700,000
Year 5 – cumulative total of, $1,000,000

And make annual payments on the agreement anniversary of:

Year 1 – $70,000, and $30,000 worth of Surge common stock
Year 2 – $70,000, and $30,000 worth of Surge common stock
Year 3 – $70,000, and $50,000 worth of Surge common stock
Year 4 – $70,000, and $70,000 worth of Surge common stock
Year 5 – $70,000, and $90,000 worth of Surge common stock

Upon fulfillment of the aforementioned commitments Surge will be deemed to have earned their undivided 80% interest and will form a joint venture with the Company. Should either company default on funding further development of the property their interest will revert to a 2.5% Net Smelter royalty should they be diluted below a 10% interest. Effective May 3, 2016, our company entered in to an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1067323 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our San Emidio property. The terms of the formal agreement were; payment of $100,000, issuance of 300,000 common shares of 1067323 B.C. Ltd., or of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property by the Optionee in the amount of $600,000 over the following three years to earn an 80% interest in the property. 1067323 then had a subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation’s remaining 20% working interest within three years of earning the 80% by paying our company a further $1,000,000, at which point our company would retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1067323 for an additional $1,000,000. 1067323 B.C. Ltd. merged with American Lithium Corp., and the first tranche of cash and shares were issued in June of 2016. The Company waived the work requirement for the first year and received extra shares of American Lithium Corp as consideration for the amendment to the Agreement. In June 2018, the Company received notification that the purchaser was relinquishing any right to earn an interest in the property and, as such, $202,901 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $217,668 allowance for the property which then had a net book value of $Nil. Surge has recently announced that they have completed geochemical work on the prospect block, and are contemplating geophysics and eventually drilling for our claims here.

On April 29, 2021 we signed a Letter Of Intent (LOI) with Altura Mining Limited (now Morella Corporation after a name change) an Australian Lithium explorer and developer and related party, whereby Morella can earn a 60% interest in the Fish Lake Valley lithium-in-brine property in Esmeralda County, Nevada by paying the Company $675,000, issuing the equivalent of $500,000 worth of Morella stock, and expending $2,000,000 of exploration work over the next four years. To date Morella is current with its obligations under the formal agreement ratified on October 12th 2021, having paid the initial $50,000 on signing the LOI, the $100,000 due on signing the formal agreement, and has issued 28,176,951 shares of Morella (1MC:ASX, Altaf:OTC-QB) common stock. On February 16, 2016, Lithium Corp had issued a news release announcing that our company had entered into a letter of intent with 1032701 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our Fish Lake Valley property. On March 10, 2016 we issued a news release announcing the signing of the Fish Lake Valley Earn-In Agreement. The terms of the Earn-In Agreement allowed 1032701 to earn an 80% interest in Fish Lake Valley for payments over three years totaling $300,000 and issuance of 400,000 common shares of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property over three years in the amount of $1,100,000. 1032701 then had a Subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation’s remaining 20% working interest within one year of earning the 80% by paying the Company a further $1,000,000, at that point the Company would retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1032701 for an additional $1,000,000. Menika Mining, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange trading under the symbol MML announced on March 8, 2016 that it intended to acquire 1032701 B.C. Ltd and the right to acquire the Fish Lake Valley Property. Menika Mining completed the acquisition of 1032701 B.C. and fulfilled the initial obligations of the Fish Lake Valley Earn-In-Agreement in April of 2016. Meninka later changed their name to American Lithium. While the Purchaser did comply with all terms of the agreement with respect to cash and share payments the Company received formal notice of the relinquishment of the Purchasers right to earn an interest in the property on April 30th 2019. As this was the termination of the option agreement $443,308 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $159,859 allowance for the properties and at that time had a net book value of $Nil. Recently Morella has indicated that they have completed phase I of a passive seismic survey, and are looking to progress onto phase II. Also they have recently shipped an initial brine sample for further bench testing for amenability to direct lithium extraction (DLE). 

On March 2, 2017 we issued a news release announcing that we had signed a letter of intent with Bormal Resources Inc. with respect to three tantalum-niobium (Ta-Nb) properties (Michael, Yeehaw, and Three Valley Gap) located in British Columbia, Canada. The Michael property in the Trail Creek Mining Division was originally staked to cover one of the most compelling tantalum in stream sediment anomalies as seen in the government RGS database in British Columbia. Bormal conducted a stream sediment sampling program in 2014, and determined that the tantalum-niobium in stream sediment anomaly here is bona fide, and in the order of 6 kilometers in length. In November of 2016 Lithium Corporation conducted a short soil geochemistry orientation program on the property as part of its due diligence, and determined that there are elevated levels of tantalum-niobium in soils here.

Also in the general area of the Michael property, the Yeehaw property had been staked over a similar but lower amplitude tantalum/total rare earth elements (TREE’s) in stream sediment anomaly. Both properties are situated within the Eocene Coryell Batholith, and at the time it was thought that these anomalies may arise from either carbonatite or pegmatite type deposits. The Company conducted a helicopter borne bio-geochemical survey on these two properties in June 2017, which did return anomalous results. This was followed up by a geological and geochemical examination of the Yeehaw property in early July 2017, and additional work of a similar nature later in July, and again in early October 2017. These examinations uncovered a zone roughly 30 meters wide which included an interval that is mineralized with approximately 0.75% TREE’s. While markedly anomalous it is not exceedingly enriched in TREE’s. However this zone may not be the “main event” in the area but a harbinger of bigger and better things, and also it is enriched in titanium (Ti), which could possibly be in the form of Perovskite, a mineral of considerable interest for the next generation of photo-voltaic cells. Preliminary geological and geochemical work were performed on the Michael property in October of 2016, followed by a brief airborne biogeochemical survey in June of 2017, and additional ground geological and geochemical assessment work in early October, 2017. The third property – Three Valley Gap, is in the Revelstoke Mining Division and is situated in a locale where several Nb-Ta enriched carbonatites have been noted to occur. A brief field program by Bormal in 2015 located one of these carbonatites, and concurrent soil sampling determined that the soils here are enriched with Nb-Ta over the known carbonatite, and indicated that there are other geochemical anomalies locally that may indicate that more carbonatites exist here and are shallowly buried.

On February 23, 2018 we issued a news release announcing that we had dropped any interest in the Michael and Three Valley Gap properties, and had renegotiated the final share payment as required in the agreement from 750,000 to 400,000 shares. The final consideration shares were issued and the Yeehaw property has been transferred by Bormal. During 2017 the Company conducted initial stream, rock and magnetometer surveys on the property, and discovered a 30 meter wide lamprophyric dyke (Horseshoe Bend showing) that exhibits anomalous titanium/REE mineralization. The company staked an additional 5227 acre (2115.51 hectares) mineral claim and conducted a brief exploration program in Spring 2018 of geological mapping and rock and soil sampling on the property. This program discovered a slightly stronger zone of similar mineralization approximately 660 feet (200 meters) to the northwest of the Horseshoe Bend, and similar float mineralization another 0.75 miles (1.2 kms) further to the northwest. Additional work was performed on the property in 2019 and 2020 which extended the known strike of the Horseshoe Bend showing approximately 50 meters to the west, and mineralized float was found that possibly indicates it could continue to the east for another several hundred meters. The Company has recently increased its land position here to approximately 5,438 acres (2200.93 hectares) and is currently in the planning stages for field season 2022.

At the BC Sugar property in the Okanagan Highlands to the east of Vernon British Columbia the Company revised its trenching permit in 2017 and conducted a program of 12 mechanized test pits in May 2018. This work was done in an area ranging from 1 to 1.5 kilometers to the east of the Weather Station Zone in a zone of numerous discrete conductors detected during the 2015 FDEM geophysical survey. Three of these pits intercepted weathered weak to moderately mineralized graphitic material with the best assay being 2.62% graphitic, carbon, and six test pits bottomed in non-mineralized bedrock. The remaining three did not reach bedrock or intercept graphitic material prior to reaching the maximum digging capability of the excavating equipment used. The Company had reduced its acreage holdings here to approximately 203 acres (82 hectares) for several years and placed this prospect on the “back burner”, however with the flake graphite market improving recently and predictions of further growth in that sector, the Company has recently re-acquired claims in the area covering the three most prospective areas, with approximately 1626 acres (657.95 hectares) of claims covering the Sugarland prospect to the east, and approximately 1321 acres (534.66 hectares) of claims covering the Weather Station and Taylor Creek showings to the west. The Company is currently in the planning stages with respect to the work to be done on these prospects this summer.

Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold a 25% membership. Summa was formed to acquire and administer the residual lands that originated in the 60’s and 70’s through Howard Hughes’s – Hughes Corporation, which went on a mining property buying spree at that time. Our company’s capital contribution to Summa, LLC was $125,000, of which $100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date we have contributed an additional $31,700 in cash, and also over the years an indeterminate amount of casual geological and land expertise to Summa, LLC. In recognition, Summa transferred five urban lots in Tonopah of indeterminate value in 2020, and since Jan 2021 have issued checks to the company for $138,000. The Tonopah property was optioned in early 2020, and the Optionee has earned a 100% interest in the property. Summa still retains a 1% (LTUM’s share 0.25%) Net Smelter Royalty on the property. Recently Summa entered into an agreement with North American Silver Corporation (TSX-V:NSC) whereby NSC can earn a 100% interest with respect to Summa’s Belmont Nevada claims (not to be confused with the Belmont mine in Tonopah) by paying $200,000 in cash or at Optionor’s discretion shares over 5 years, and election must be made by the sixth agreement anniversary to purchase the lands (69.96 acres) at $10,000 per acre. Should NSC earn their interest Summa, LLC would retain a 1% Net Smelter Royalty – 50% of which may be subsequently purchased by the Optionor. Summa, LLC still retains a 100% interest (subject to a 2% NSR in favor of Summa Corp. (the successor entity to the Hughes Corporation) in a further five project areas in the state of Nevada, and Lithium Corporation remains committed to casually helping them move the projects along so that they may be optioned eventually. 

Competition

The mining industry is intensely competitive. We compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major mining companies, which have substantially greater technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for access to funds. There are other competitors that have operations in the area and the presence of these competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete for financing and obtain the service providers, staff or equipment necessary for the exploration and exploitation of our properties.
Compliance with Government Regulation

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in United States and Canada, as well as other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters.

We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States and Canada. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.

Research and Development

We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.

Intellectual Property

We do not currently have any intellectual property, other than our domain name and website, www.lithiumcorporation.com.

Employees

We have no employees. Our officers and directors provide their services to our company as independent consultants.
