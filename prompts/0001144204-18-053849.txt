ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Rezolute, Inc. (“Rezolute”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of innovative drug therapies to improve the lives of patients with metabolic and orphan diseases.
 
We leverage metabolic and corporate development expertise to bring forward a compelling portfolio. This past year, we advanced a strategy we feel will be increasingly attractive to investors. This included executing our in- / out-licensing model, with two successful program acquisitions, closing down in-house manufacturing, and plans to seek a strategic partner for AB101 upon completion of its Phase 1 study during calendar year 2019.
 
Our Pipeline
 
RZ358
 
RZ358 is the leading asset within our portfolio. We intend to fully develop and market this compound.
 
On December 6, 2017, we licensed from XOMA LLC (“XOMA”) the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize XOMA 358 (now RZ358) for an orphan indication, Congenital Hyperinsulinism (“CHI”).
 
CHI is a rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 30,000 newborns. It is also the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in children. About 60 percent of infants with CHI experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood.
 
Ordinarily, beta cells in the pancreas secrete just enough insulin to keep blood sugar in the normal range. With CHI, the secretion of insulin is not properly regulated as the beta cells secrete too much insulin resulting in excessive low blood sugar, severe hypoglycemia.
 
In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by lethargy, irritability, and difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia increase the risk of serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, coma, and possibly death.
 
To avoid hypoglycemia, many children require frequent glucose monitoring and feeding, including intravenous or intestinal administration of sugar solutions, particularly overnight. This burdensome treatment regimen has a substantially negative effect on the quality of life for these children and their families.
 
A significant number of children cannot be adequately treated with, or do not tolerate, existing medical therapies. Surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas is a cornerstone of management for many children, but is invasive and diabetes inducing.
 
RZ358 is a first-in-class fully human monoclonal antibody that counteracts the effects of elevated insulin (hyperinsulinemia) by, in effect, turning down the insulin receptor when too much insulin is present. As such, it is well-suited as a treatment for severe, persistent hypoglycemia. XOMA demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept for RZ358 in Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies.
 
RZ358 has designated orphan status in the US and EU.
 
We plan to launch Phase 2b studies in calendar year 2018 or 2019 with the potential to accelerate late-stage pivotal trials for an abbreviated path-to-market strategy.

RZ402 and RZ602
 
On August 4, 2017, we licensed from ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ActiveSite”) their oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor portfolio (“Portfolio”) targeting the treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”) and other plasma kallikrein-medicated diseases such as hereditary angioedema (“HAE”).
 
RZ402
 
It is estimated that approximately 50 million individuals worldwide suffer from vision-threatening complications of diabetes, including DME, which is one of the main causes of vision loss in working-age adults globally. With the growth of diabetes, DME is expected to increase in prevalence beyond its current estimate of 750,000 individuals in the US and 21 million worldwide.
 
DME is a metabolic disease that results from an increase in retinal vascular permeability (RVP) in the setting of diabetic retinopathy (abnormal retinal blood vessel growth caused by poorly controlled blood sugar levels). Vascular leakage from retinal blood vessels leads to swelling of the retina, including the macula, an area of the retina that is very important for vision. The kinin system and the production of bradykinin have been implicated in the vascular leakage associated with DME.
 
Current treatment approaches are onerous, involving injections into the eye by retinal specialists on a monthly or bimonthly basis. In addition to a segment of the DME population that does not respond to these treatments, the extent of therapeutic benefit directly correlates with adherence to this route of administration and regimen. Intravitreal injection represents a route of administration with significant burden for both patients and their healthcare providers, leading to high rates of non-adherence and ultimately, suboptimal therapeutic outcomes.
 
RZ402 is a potential new therapy for DME from the PKI portfolio. RZ402 has been shown to normalize RVP in clinically-relevant animal models of macular edema as effectively as the current injectable treatments, thereby supporting its potential as a stand-alone therapy for macular edema resulting from diabetes and other causes.
 
We plan to file an IND for RZ402 in calendar year 2019 and afterwards, embark upon Phase 1 studies.
 
RZ602
 
Approximately one in 50,000 patients worldwide have HAE.
 
HAE is an orphan disease characterized by recurring attacks of sudden and extreme swelling that can affect the face and mucous membranes, abdomen, and genitalia. Attacks can be painful, debilitating, varied in frequency and even life-threatening, due to swelling around the airway.
 
The disease is caused by a problem with a gene that controls the management of a specific protein, the C1 inhibitor. When there is an imbalance in the C1 inhibitor, there may be excessive bradykinin production causing tiny blood vessels to “leak” or push fluid into parts of the patient’s body, resulting in an HAE attack. The trigger for an attack is variable from person to person and even time to time.
 
Currently available therapies target the prevention or termination of attacks, but are highly invasive and inconvenient due to the subcutaneous / intravenous routes of administration or have an undesirable side effect profile.
 
RZ602 is a potential new therapy for HAE from the PKI portfolio. Similar to our efforts with RZ402 for DME, the objective of RZ602 is to stop the inflammatory cascade by inhibiting the production of kallikrein and thereby halting the downstream release of bradykinin and eventual swelling.
 
We plan to file an IND for RZ602 in calendar year 2020 and afterwards, embark upon Phase 1 studies.

AB101
 
Our next product candidate (“AB101”), a microsphere formulation of PEGylated human recombinant insulin, is being developed as an extended acting basal insulin intended for once-weekly subcutaneous injection, for use alone and in combination with bolus prandial insulin or oral glucose lowering therapies, to improve glycemic control in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
 
We believe AB101 has the potential to provide a near peak-less, slow and uniform release of basal insulin. The current standard of care in the $11 billion basal insulin market is daily or twice-a-day injections.
 
In July of 2017, we dosed our first patient in our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of AB101. The Phase 1 clinical trial is a first-in-human single ascending dose study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AB101 in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
 
The first study part will be sequential cohort dose ranging of AB101, while an optional second study part will compare one or more tested doses of AB101 from part 1 to active comparator Lantus® (insulin glargine).  In addition to safety and pharmacokinetic assessments, the time-action pharmacology of AB101 (onset, peak, and end of action) will be evaluated using several measures of glycemic response, including the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique, continuous glucose monitoring, and background insulin use.
 
Following the completion of the first part of the study, we expect to review data and high-level results within calendar year 2018 or 2019. Afterwards, we will evaluate out-licensing potential.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and in the development and acquisition of technologies.
 
There are a handful of companies developing therapies for CHI that could pose as potential competitors to RZ358. Zealand Pharma, Xeris Pharma, and Hanmi are three such companies.
 
There are a handful of companies developing therapies for diabetic macular edema that could pose as potential competitors to the plasma kallikrein inhibitor therapy we recently acquired from ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals. KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Verseon, and Thrombogenics are three such companies.
 
If successfully commercialized, AB101 would compete directly against Sanofi’s Lantus and Toujeo, Novo Nordisk’s Levemir and Tresiba, Eli Lilly’s Basaglar as well as any other branded or biosimilar basal insulin therapies that obtain regulatory approval in advance of AB101.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the US and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. All of our potential products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical therapies are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of such products.
