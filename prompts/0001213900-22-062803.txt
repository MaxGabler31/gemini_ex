Overview



At SunHydrogen, our goal is to replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable hydrogen.



Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. When hydrogen fuel is used to power transportation and industry, the only byproduct left behind is pure water, unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas that emit carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is rare – so rare, in fact, that today about 95% of hydrogen is produced from steam reforming of natural gas (Source: US Department of Energy, Hydrogen Fuel Basics). This process is both economically and environmentally unsound.



The SunHydrogen solution offers an efficient and cost-effective way to produce truly green hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water. Our core technology is a self-contained, nanoparticle-based hydrogen generator that mimics photosynthesis to split water molecules, resulting in hydrogen. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level, we believe we have developed a low-cost method to potentially produce environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen.



We believe renewable hydrogen has already proven itself to be a key solution in helping the world meet climate targets, and we believe our technology potentially offers solutions to the challenges that the hydrogen future presents, including cost of production and transportation.



Because our process only requires sunlight and water, our technology can be installed near the point of hydrogen use. This eliminates the need for pipelines and trucks that result in high carbon emissions and high capital investment. Additionally, because our process directly uses the electrical charges created by sunlight to generate hydrogen, our nanoparticle technology does not rely on grid power or require the costly power electronics that conventional electrolyzers do.



With a target cost of $2.50/kg., we aspire for our technology to be cost-competitive with brown hydrogen and below the cost of clean hydrogen competitors. We believe our solution has the potential to clear a path for green hydrogen to compete with natural gas hydrogen and gain mass market acceptance as a true replacement for fossil fuels.



Our technology is primarily developed at three laboratories – our independent laboratory in Coralville, Iowa, the SunHydrogen laboratory at the University of Iowa, and the Singh laboratory at University of Michigan.



A longtime development partner to SunHydrogen, The Iowa research team has worked over the past several years to lead the scale-up of our technology.



We started 2022 with the addition of an additional research and development laboratory to fuel our goal of scaling up our nanoparticle-based green hydrogen technology. The Coralville, Iowa laboratory space has enabled us to hire several new senior engineers and chemists and accelerate our developmental targets toward commercialization.



Led by Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Syed Mubeen and Director of Technology Dr. Joun Lee, the Iowa research team is focused on building tandem photoelectrosynthetic heterostructures (nanoparticle-based tandem semiconductor units) and evaluating their manufacturability at scales relevant for commercialization. This involves porous substrate fabrication and development of SunHydrogen’s two proprietary semiconductor nanoparticle units within these porous substrates (dual junction devices).

In the past year, the Iowa team has met several key developmental milestones in the path to achieving a production-quality prototype of our nanoparticle technology, including the following:




(1) | Developed a robust fabrication toolkit to scale porous anodic alumina on transparent conducting oxide substrates in which the tandem nanoparticle units will be fabricated. This achievement aided SunHydrogen’s industry partner InRedox in successfully developing a high-throughput substrate fabrication process.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Developed facile deposition chemistries to fabricate semiconductors, interconnects, and contacts needed for tandem nanoparticle devices. This achievement aided the work of our industry partner MSC Co. LTD, who is supplying SunHydrogen with bulk chemicals for nanoparticle growth.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Successfully fabricated both of our proprietary semiconductor units and demonstrated photocurrents greater than 10 mA/cm2 for each unit and photovoltages greater than 800 mV for each unit in substrates relevant for prototype demonstration.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Demonstrated dual junction devices with photovoltages that exceed the theoretical voltage needed for water-splitting.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In June 2022, we announced that we achieved successful fabrication of one of our two proprietary semiconductor units at production-quality prototype scale. The Iowa team thoroughly tested its ability for hydrogen production using sunlight and water containing organics derived from biomass resources.



In this announcement, we also shared that persisting supply chain challenges have delayed fabrication of our second proprietary semiconductor unit at production-quality prototype scale. However, the Iowa research team has identified alternate solutions to successfully fabricate our second proprietary nanoparticle semiconductor unit at production-quality prototype scale. These solutions include pairing one of the SunHydrogen’s proprietary semiconductor unit on Silicon Heterojunction solar cells, Perovskite solar cells, or CdTe-based solar cells. The Iowa team recently had success in pairing one of SunHydrogen’s proprietary semiconductor units with Silicon and Perovskite cells and demonstrated solar hydrogen production. The team is currently optimizing this alternate approach to maximize solar-to-hydrogen efficiency using device housing developed by SunHydrogen’s industry partners. Moving forward, the team will develop novel deposition chemistry that is vendor independent for growing the second semiconductor unit while working with other solar cells in parallel. Solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for both the approaches will be evaluated using devices fabricated in prototype relevant scales.



Outside of our central research and development hub in Iowa, we’ve entered into a sponsored research agreement with the University of Michigan and further expanded our industrial partnerships across the U.S., Germany, South Korea, and Japan. Our current industrial partners include: SCHMID Group of Germany; MSC Co. LTD of South Korea; Geomatec of Japan; Ionomr Innovations of British Columbia; Chromis Technologies of New Jersey; Optimum Anode of California; and RuC2N of South Korea.



By diversifying our commercialization strategy in this way, we have been able to form relationships with industrial partners who are specialized in individual components of our technology such as electroplating, substrate processing and catalyst/membrane integration.



SCHMID Group will focus on the design and engineering of our generator housing as we continue scaling our technology to larger dimensions. InRedox and MSC Co. LTD are focused on substrate manufacturing and electroplating chemistries, respectively. Geomatec is also working to facilitate our transition to large-scale substrate manufacturing.



We are working with Ionomr Innovations and Chromis Technologies to integrate both proton exchange membranes (PEM) and anion exchange membranes (AEM) into our proprietary substrates and evaluate performance metrics for sustainable hydrogen production.

With our newest partners, Optimum Anode and RuC2N, we are working to achieve successful catalyst integration and identify the best catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen production.



Led by Dr. Nirala Singh, one of the lead inventors on SunHydrogen Patent No. 9,593,053B1, the University of Michigan team is focused on understanding the requirements of the generator housing and optimizing and testing potential oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts to accelerate scaleup and increase efficiency of photoelectrochemically active heterostructures. In the past year, they have demonstrated deposition of oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution catalysts through atomic layer deposition and tested these materials for their ability to catalyze oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen evolution catalysts match the best performing catalysts and can be deposited on our solar cell materials with low thickness to mitigate parasitic light absorption. The atomic layer deposited oxygen evolution catalyst did not match the necessary metrics for further evaluation. However, using a sputtering technique, they synthesized an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst that can match the state-of-the-art oxygen evolution catalysts in the open literature. With these two catalysts, the solar cell voltage provided upon illumination is sufficient to produce hydrogen at high rates. These catalysts are being integrated with the systems used at University of Iowa.



University of Michigan also identified membrane-to-light absorber integration strategies to help optimize the generator housing dimensions, in collaboration with InRedox. They evaluated the voltage losses in various potential systems to identify the most promising configurations and eliminate configurations that would result in significant energy losses. The most promising systems were sent to Ionomr Innovations and Chromis Technologies to integrate membranes for testing of energy losses and stability. A model to scale up to multi-wafer systems was developed and is being validated. This model incorporated the entire system including generator housing, oxygen evolution catalyst, and hydrogen evolution catalyst and also helps identify the most important components for further increasing hydrogen production efficiency.



Looking ahead to the final months of 2022, we continue making steady progress toward the developmental targets we initially set for the year, which include:




● | Successful fabrication of semiconductor units at production-quality prototype scales
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Successful integration of membranes at production-quality prototype scales
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Successful integration of catalysts at production-quality prototype scales
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Successful testing and demonstration of production-quality prototype units
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------




We have a dedicated scientific and executive team, a growing number of respected industrial partners, and we will continue doing our best to push past any setbacks or supply chain challenges that come our way. 



Additionally, we are well-capitalized to begin pursuing strategic investments in the hydrogen space. We are actively pursuing opportunities for investment and acquisition of complimentary hydrogen technologies, and we are fortunate to have the resources to maximize our impact in this fast-growing industry.



Market Opportunity



Hydrogen generation is projected to become a $1 trillion per year market by 2050 (Source: Goldman Sachs, Carbonomics: The clean hydrogen revolution). Current fossil fuels can’t sustain future energy requirements environmentally or economically, and hydrogen fuel technologies are being adopted across all sectors as the world moves toward renewable alternatives.



Over 110 countries have set goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and as governments are looking to clean energy sources like hydrogen to help them meet their targets (Source: United Nations, The race to zero emissions, and why the world depends on it). It is estimated that nearly 25% of global energy will come from clean hydrogen alone by 2050 (Source: Goldman Sachs, Green Hydrogen: The next transformational driver of the Utilities industry).



In the US, California is leading the way in hydrogen strategies, with more fuel cell passenger vehicles on the road than any other state and one of the largest hydrogen refueling station networks in the world (Source: Sierra Nevada Ally, Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles are Building Momentum in California). Globally, over 320 green hydrogen production demonstration projects have been announced, and governments around the world have put forth ambitious strategies to utilize hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across all sectors of the economy including transportation, feedstock and industrial heat use (Source: International Energy Agency, Hydrogen Projects Database).

Existing Market Growth 



In August 2022, The Inflation Reduction Act, which allots $369 billion to renewable energy and climate projects, was signed into law in the US, and it is already reshaping the hydrogen market and the larger clean energy market as we know it. “Among its features, the law has a 10-year extension of solar and wind tax credits and incentives to support new technology, with hydrogen and energy storage set to be the greatest beneficiaries,” according to Morningstar’s chief US market strategist Dave Sekera (Source: Markets Insider, Clean energy stocks are set to be the big winners of the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act just signed by Biden, Morningstar says).



Specifically, the Act includes a new tax credit that will award up to $3/kg for low carbon hydrogen, with exact credit amounts to be determined by calculating a given project’s greenhouse gas emissions (Source: S&P Global, Hydrogen tax credits preserved in new US Inflation Reduction Act).



The Inflation Reduction Act’s passage also followed a summer of surging gas prices and increased demand for gasoline. As supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts continue to affect fuel prices globally, the hydrogen market is rallying support and interest from consumers and governments alike.



An additional factor currently driving the global hydrogen market is the need to reduce sulfur content in petroleum products. U.S. federal and state governments have adopted various programs, including the Tier 3 program, to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline, motor oil and diesel. Particularly, there is a growing demand for petroleum products from developing countries. Hydrogen is used in various refining processes including hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization to crack bigger molecules into lighter ones and produce more usable products.



For all these reasons and more, we believe our renewable hydrogen-producing technology possesses significant early market opportunity, especially as innovation and infrastructure continue to develop.



Hydrogen Mobility



The auto manufacturing and vehicle industries are among the most recognized applications for hydrogen fuel technologies. According to a 2022 study by Information Trends, close to 44,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles had been sold by year-end 2021 since their sales first began. Historically, sales have been held back due to the lack of a solid hydrogen refueling infrastructure, but the numbers are projected to rise quickly, and fuel cell vehicles are gaining momentum around the world. In another study, Information Trends projected that close to 600,000 hydrogen fuel cell buses and minibuses will be in service by 2035 (Source: Information Trends, Global Market for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Buses).



In California, labor leaders and CEOs of some of the world’s leading auto and energy companies including Toyota, Hyundai, Chevron, Shell, and more are urging Governor Gavin Newsom to invest in hydrogen to meet climate goals. The joint letter, published in August 2022, calls on Newsom to allocate $300 million in the state budget to fund the final construction of 1,000 hydrogen fueling stations statewide in the next decade (Source: California Hydrogen Coalition, Labor Leaders, CEOs Call on Governor Newson to Invest in Hydrogen to Meet Climate Goals).



Additionally, hydrogen has emerged as an ideal solution for a myriad of mobility-related applications beyond fuel cell vehicles.



In a 2022 report from the Ocean Conservancy, researchers concluded that green hydrogen-based fuels are the best option to transition the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. “Producing green hydrogen-based fuels can kickstart the transition to new shipping fuels along promising green corridor routes within the U.S. and can make key down payments that will drive further investment in renewable energy and feed the demand for climate action within the global transportation sector,” said Daniel Hubbell, shipping emissions campaign manager for Ocean Conservancy (Source: Ocean Conservancy, Green Hydrogen-Based Fuels are the Best Option to Transition the Shipping Industry Away from Fossil Fuels, New Report Finds).

In the long-haul trucking industry, hydrogen fuel cells present a zero-emission solution where battery-electric vehicles would be “too heavy for the job” (Source: Truck News, Hydrogen fuel cells ready for work in work trucks). According to speakers at the 2022 Green Truck Summit, however, hydrogen fuel cells may also be well-suited for work trucks that make shorter-term journeys. “Very high utilization vehicles, to go zero emission, absolutely need hydrogen,” said Craig Knight, CEO of Hyzon Motors. “The sweet spot for fuel cells is the dead zone for diesel engines. These are the vehicles that stop and start all the time. These are the vehicles that spend so much time on idle. These are the vehicles with massive PTO loads or refrigeration,” Knight continued. “So, the best use cases are drayage, refrigerated trucks, concrete trucks, garbage trucks – all these things with the significant auxiliary loads.” (Source: Truck News, Hydrogen fuel cells ready for work in work trucks).



In August 2022, Germany introduced the first-ever rail line to be entirely run on hydrogen-powered trains. “Fourteen hydrogen trains powered by fuel cell propulsion will exclusively run on the route in Bremervörde, Lower Saxony,” CNN reported. The trains have a range of 1,000 kilometers, meaning they can run for an entire day on the network on a single tank of hydrogen, and a hydrogen filing station has already been established on the route (Source: CNN, The world’s first hydrogen-powered passenger trains are here).



Hydrogen is even powering factory forklifts for commerce leaders like Walmart and Amazon: In April 2022, Walmart purchased hydrogen from Plug Power to fuel as many as 9,500 machines across the retailer’s fulfillment and distribution centers (Source: Bloomberg, Walmart Will Run Forklifts on ‘Green’ Hydrogen in Plug Power Deal). Amazon and Plug Power entered a similar agreement in August 2022, with Plug Power providing Amazon with 10,950 tons of liquefied hydrogen per year that will be used to fuel transportation and building operations starting in 2025 (Source: Forbes, Amazon To Buy Plug Power’s ‘Green’ Hydrogen In Deal with $2.1 Billion Stock Option). Along with fuel for forklifts, Amazon may also use hydrogen to power a range of vehicles used in delivery operations, including long-haul trucks, the article stated.



Whether in traditional vehicles, marine ships, long-haul trucks, trains, or even factory forklifts, it is clear that hydrogen has already made a significant mark on the mobility industry, and we only expect it to become more prolific as governments continue to support the development of relevant infrastructure that the hydrogen future calls for.



Our Technology



Technology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight and Water



Powered by solar energy, billions of our microscopic nanoparticles split apart water at the molecular level, extracting hydrogen for use as a clean energy source and leaving behind only clean oxygen as a byproduct. This process is similar to what happens inside a plant cell during photosynthesis: Each Photoelectrosynthetically Active Heterostructures (or PAH) nanoparticle is a microscopic machine, composed of multiple layers enabling the solar electrolysis reaction to take place.
Water Splitting



In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds. Essentially, manufactured hydrogen serves as a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable, such as solar or wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.





5







While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following industry-wide challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:




● | Energy Inefficiency — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional electrolysis methods lose much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes resulting in only a small portion of electricity making it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. We intend to address this problem with our low-cost and energy-efficient nanoparticle technology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for Clean Water — Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using large quantities of available water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. Our technology is being designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology



Water electrolysis in its simplest form is the transfer of “input electrons” in the following chemical reactions:




● | Cathode (reduction): 2H2O + 2e- ® H2 + 2OH-
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Anode (oxidation): 4OH- ® O2 + 2H2O + 4 e-
--+-------------------------------------------




From these equations, one can deduce that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split each water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.



SunHydrogen Panel™



Since our particles are intended to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis, directly producing hydrogen and oxygen without the need for costly intermediate power conversions, they can be housed in very low-cost reactors. To facilitate the commercial use of our self-contained particle technology, we are developing a modular system that will enable the onsite daily production and storage of hydrogen for any-time use in electricity generation.



We refer to our potential product as the SunHydrogen Panel which is comprised of the following components:




1. | The Generator Housing - Our novel device design is the first of its kind to safely separate oxygen and hydrogen in the photoelectrochemical process, minimizing the sacrifice of solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. This device houses the water and the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a novel ion-exchange membrane integration strategy for separating the oxygen from the hydrogen products, efficient ion transport safely enables efficient solar hydrogen production.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The NanoParticle or Solar Cell - Powered by solar energy, billions of our microscopic nanoparticle solar cells split apart water at the molecular level, extracting hydrogen for use as a clean energy source and leaving behind only clean oxygen as a byproduct.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Oxygen Evolution Catalyst - Uniformly applied to the solar cell or nanoparticle, an oxygen evolution catalyst efficiently oxidizes water molecules to generate oxygen gas. The oxygen evolution catalyst must be robust to withstand long operating hours under acidic and alkaline conditions.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst - Necessary for collecting electrons to reduce protons for generating hydrogen gas, we have identified a strategy to minimize the use of precious metal-based catalysts and integrated the hydrogen catalyst into our generator system for efficient solar hydrogen production.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Coating Technologies - Two major coating technologies were developed to protect the nanoparticles and solar cells from photocorrosion under water: A transparent conductive coating to protect our nanoparticles and solar cells from photocorrosion during the water splitting process and efficiently transfer charges to catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions; and a polymer combination that protects the semiconductor solar cells that would otherwise fail in aquatic environments, instead ensuring a long lifetime for solar hydrogen production.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the process of optimizing our nanoparticles to be efficient and only use earth abundant materials (an ongoing process), we experimented with commercially available triple junction solar cells to perform tests with our generator housing and other components. Through this experimentation, our discovery led us to believe that we could bring a system (Gen 1) to market utilizing these readily available cells while our nanoparticles are still being optimized. While these solar cells also absorb sunlight and produce the necessary charge for splitting the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, their efficiency is low, thus we have made the strategic decision to focus on our NanoParticle strategy (Gen 2) and use the Gen 1 hydrogen generators for proof of concept purposes only.



Our business and commercialization plan utilizes our second generation of hydrogen panels featuring the nanoparticle-based technology where billions of autonomous solar cells are electrodeposited onto protective porous sheets and manufactured in a roll to roll process or wafer process and inserted into our proprietary panels. For this generation, we have received multiple patents and our target cost of hydrogen production is $2.50 per kilogram before pressurization.



In addition to our sponsored research agreements with the University of Iowa and University of Michigan, we are working with a growing group of specialized industrial partners to help commercialize our renewable hydrogen panels that use sunlight and water to generate hydrogen. Our current industrial partners include: SCHMID Group of Germany; MSC Co. LTD of South Korea; Geomatec of Japan; Ionomr Innovations of British Columbia; Chromis Technologies of New Jersey; Optimum Anode of California; and RuC2N of South Korea.



SCHMID Group will focus on the design and engineering of our generator housing as we continue scaling our technology to larger dimensions. InRedox and MSC Co. LTD are focused on substrate manufacturing and electroplating chemistries, respectively. Geomatec is also working to facilitate our transition to large-scale substrate manufacturing. Ionomr Innovations and Chromis Technologies are working to integrate both proton exchange membranes (PEM) and anion exchange membranes (AEM) into our proprietary substrates and evaluate performance metrics for sustainable hydrogen production. With Optimum Anode and RuC2N, we are working to achieve successful catalyst integration and identify the best catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen production. 



Intellectual Property



On November 14, 2011, we filed a provisional application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property rights for “Photoelectrosynthetically Active Heterostructures” A year later on November 14, 2012, we filed a non-provisional application claiming priority to the provisional application. On March 14, 2017, a first patent covering the structural design of Photoelectrosynthetically Active Heterostructures (PAH) was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053B1. A divisional application claiming priority to the foregoing applications was filed, and on April 3, 2018, a second patent covering the method for manufacturing PAH was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053B2. These patents protect the Company’s proprietary design and manufacturing method of a self-contained solar-to-hydrogen device made up of billions of solar-powered water-splitting nanoparticles, per square centimeter. These nanoparticles are separated by a protective coating that prevents corrosion during extended periods of hydrogen production. The aim of producing these nanoparticles is to achieve high solar -to-hydrogen conversion efficiency at low cost. These patents expire on November 14, 2032.



An important aspect of the patented technology referred to in the preceding paragraph is the integrated structures of high-density arrays of nano-sized solar cells as part of hydrogen production nanoparticles. The technology enables manufacturing of ultra-thin sheets for solar hydrogen production, requiring substantially less material as compared to conventional solar cells used in rooftop power applications. 



On March 21, 2014, we jointly filed a provisional application with the University of California, Santa Barbara for the “Multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cell with enhanced photovoltages.” Thereafter, we filed a non-provisional application on March 16, 2015 and a corresponding PCT Application on March 17, 2015. These applications cover our semiconductor designs to enhance the photovoltages of the nano-sized solar cells in the PAH structures. The semiconductor designs stacking multiple junctions inside the PAH structures would be an efficient and economical solution for the photovoltaic and the photoelectrochemical industries. Patents were granted in Australia in April of 2018, China and Europe in March of 2019, and in the U.S. as United States Patent No. 10,100,415 in October of 2018. A patent application is currently pending in India. This patent expires on October 21, 2036.



On September 26, 2016, we filed jointly with the University of Iowa a provisional application for “Integrated Membrane Solar Fuel Production Assembly” to protect the intellectual property for our generator housing system that safely separates oxygen and hydrogen in the water-splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gases. Utilizing a special architecture that integrates membranes for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. On September 26, 2017, we filed a PCT Application that was later nationalized in the U.S. on March 26, 2019. The U.S. patent application for this important invention is pending and prosecution is ongoing.

Strategic Partners



As of October 1, 2022, we have renewed our sponsored research agreement with the University of Iowa. In the event the research agreement is terminated by the sponsor, the sponsor shall pay all costs accrued by the University as of the date of termination, including non-cancellable obligations. This term of the research agreement runs through September 30, 2023.



As of October 1, 2022, the sponsored research agreement with the University of Michigan has been extended through September 30, 2023.



In February 2021, we entered into a cooperation agreement with SCHMID Group of Freudenstadt, Germany. Due to delays associated with supply chain challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the cooperation agreement was extended to fully complete the work scope with no additional cost to the company. Through the collaboration, we identified key manufacturing needs in the areas of electroplating chemistries, substrate processing and membrane and catalyst integration that require collaboration with specialized industry partners. To address these scale-up challenges, we have since adopted a more diversified scale-up strategy. Our work with SCHMID Group continues with a narrowed concentration. SCHMID Group will focus on the design and engineering of our generator housing as we continue scaling our technology to larger dimensions.



Competition



Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. Key players in the traditional hydrogen production industry include Linde, Air Liquide, Air Products, Praxair, and more.



At this time, however, we view our primary competition as companies that have developed or are currently developing renewable hydrogen production technology. Green or renewable hydrogen can be produced through electrolyzers if the electrolyzers are powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind. Some of these companies include:



Plug Power: Plug Power (Stock symbol: PLUG) is engaged in the development of hydrogen fuel cell systems that replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles powered by electricity. The company is currently building green hydrogen plants to produce at least 70 tons of liquid green hydrogen daily by the end of 2022 and 500 tons daily by 2025.



NEL Hydrogen: NEL Hydrogen (Stock symbol: NLLSF) delivers solutions to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen from renewable energy. The company’s hydrogen solutions cover the entire value chain from hydrogen production technologies to hydrogen fueling stations, enabling industries to transition to green hydrogen.



Fusion Fuel: Fusion Fuel (Stock symbol: HTOO) has developed a modular solar to hydrogen solution, combining proven solar concentration technology with a proprietary micro-electrolyzer that allows it to produce zero-emissions green hydrogen at highly competitive costs. The company sells its HEVO-Solar technology to customers interested in producing their own green hydrogen. It also develops company-owned green hydrogen farms.



ITM Power: ITM Power (Stock symbol: ITMPF) designs, manufactures, and integrates electrolyzers based on proton exchange membrane technology to produce green hydrogen using renewable electricity and tap water. ITM Power works with strategic partners including Linde, Shell, Snam, Hyundai, and Honda to scale its impact and industrial reach.



McPhy: McPhy (Stock symbol: MCPHY) specializes in the design, production and integration of high pressure alkaline electrolyzers and hydrogen stations. McPhy has five development, engineering and production sites in France, Italy, and Germany, and it is backed by solid and constantly-evolving European industrial foundations.





8







If not powered by renewable sources, electrolyzers require external electricity most likely created by coal, gas or oil. We believe that our process when fully developed may potentially offer a competitive advantage as we anticipate it will be fully renewable and utilize no external power other than the sun. However, it should be noted that the renewable hydrogen market is rich with competitors, like the companies mentioned above, who have already successfully commercialized green hydrogen production technologies. We anticipate that existing leaders will continue to hone the efficiency of their products and drive down cost of green hydrogen per kilogram, thus creating a more competitive, challenging environment for emerging, not-yet-commercialized technologies such as our own.
