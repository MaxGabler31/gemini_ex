Company Overview 
 American Software, Inc. (American Software or the Company) was incorporated as a Georgia corporation in 1970. We develop, market and support a portfolio of software and services that deliver supply chain and advanced retail planning solutions, product lifecycle management, supply chain management, product sourcing, vendor compliance and enterprise management to the global marketplace. Our software and services are designed to bring business value to enterprises by supporting their operations over cloud-based Internet-architected solutions. References to the Company, our products, our software, our services and similar references include the appropriate business segment actually providing the product or service. 
 We provide our software solutions through three major operating segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups. The three operating segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (SCM), (2) Information Technology (IT) Consulting and (3) Other. Today, our customer base is approximately 1,350 companies located in more than 80 countries. 
 
1 
 
The SCM segment consists of (i) Logility, Inc. (Logility) which provides supply chain optimization and advance retail planning solutions, as an integrated suite of sales and operations planning, demand optimization, inventory optimization, manufacturing planning and scheduling, supply optimization, retail allocation and merchandise planning, as well as (ii) Demand Management, Inc. (DMI or Demand Management) , which provides Software as a Service (SaaS) architected supply chain planning solutions to streamline the forecasting, inventory, production, supply, allocation, distribution and management of products between trading partners, (iii) New Generation Computing (NGC), which provides cloud solutions for supply chain management, product lifecycle management, vendor quality, and vendor compliance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) for both brand retailers and manufacturers, and (iv) Halo, which provides advanced analytics and business intelligence solutions for the supply chain market. The SCM solutions are marketed and sold through both a direct sales team as well as an indirect global VAR (value added reseller) distribution network. 
 The IT Consulting segment consists of The Proven Method, Inc., an IT staffing and consulting services firm, which provides support for their customers products, such as software enhancements, documentation, updates, customer education, consulting, systems integration services, maintenance and support services. The Other segment consists of American Software ERP, which provides purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, e-commerce and traditional manufacturing solutions, and unallocated corporate overhead expenses. 
 Previously, we maintained three operating segments: (1) SCM, (2) IT and (3) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Following the organizational realignment during the third quarter fiscal 2018, NGC was repositioned out of the ERP segment and into the SCM segment due to the launch of the new Andromeda platform for Supply Chain Management. There were no changes to the IT segment. Certain prior year amounts have been recasted to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation. The change in reportable segments had no effect on our previously reported consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 We derive revenues primarily from four sources: subscriptions, software licenses, services, and maintenance. We generally determine software license and SaaS subscription fees based on the depth of functionality, number of software modules, users and/or sites licensed and/or subscribed. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, consulting services, SaaS, hosting, and managed services. We bill primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognize revenues as we perform services. Subscription and maintenance agreements typically are for a one- to three-year term, commencing at the time of the initial contract. We generally bill these fees annually in advance and then recognize the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the agreement. Deferred revenues represent advance payments or billings for subscriptions, software licenses, services and maintenance billed in advance of the time we recognize the related revenues. 
 Our cost of revenues for licenses includes amortization of developed technology and capitalized computer software development costs, salaries and benefits and value-added reseller (VAR) commissions. Costs for maintenance and services revenues include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations, customer support and consulting, and other personnel-related expenses as well as agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect channel. 
 Our sales and marketing expenses generally include the salaries and commissions we pay to our direct sales professionals, along with marketing, promotional, travel and associated costs. Our general and administrative expenses generally include the salaries and benefits we pay to executive, corporate and support personnel, as well as office rent, utilities, communications expenses, and various professional fees. 
 Industry Background 
 Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners (customers, suppliers, and carriers) within the extended enterprise or across global supply chain networks can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, improved customer service, and increased revenue. Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners to forecast demand, source, manufacture, distribute and deliver goods and services to their customers. Supply chain management involves both the activities related to supplying products or services (source, make, move, buy, store, and deliver) as well as the sales and marketing activities that influence the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. The extended enterprise includes sourcing materials and vendor compliance for those activities, as well as product delivery to the customers customer.

Today, several market trends are driving organizations to expand collaboration with trading partners along the supply chain. Todays leading manufacturers and distributors have become more responsive to retailers and consumers, often referred to as omni-channel and more recently as Unified Commerce, which has increased the demand for improved planning and business analytics capabilities to model more complexity and effectively position inventory. At the same time, global economic conditions and competitive pressures are forcing businesses to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies. As a result, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to improve manufacturing efficiency and logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands. These pressures are compounded by the rate of product churn, increasing globalization and complexity of the interactions among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers. 
 To compete in global markets, businesses must improve the performance of their supply chains, as well as the key functions, processes and technologies that make up an integrated supply chain network. Supply chain planning software solutions create a competitive advantage by modeling the time-phased need for products at a specific location in the business network and enables reducing the cost of goods sold, improving customer service, building global brands and increasing global supply chain visibility as companies move product to the market quicker. Our customers goal is to provide the right product in the right place at the right time at a competitive price. 
 The supply chain planning process focuses on demand forecasting, supply and inventory optimization, global sourcing, distribution, transportation and manufacturing planning and scheduling, product lifecycle management (PLM), product sourcing and vendor compliance. Planning software is designed to increase revenues, improve forecast accuracy, optimize production scheduling, streamline global sourcing, reduce inventory costs, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs, and improve customer service. The supply chain execution function addresses procuring, vendor compliance, manufacturing, warehousing, fulfilling orders and distributing products throughout the supply chain. 
 In order to effectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require integrated business planning (IBP), sales and operations planning (S&OP), supply chain planning, allocation, sourcing, supply chain execution, supply chain management and supply chain analytics software that provide enterprise systems for integrated communication, optimization and collaboration among the various constituents throughout the supply chain network. This enhanced collaboration synchronizes production plans with demand forecasts, thereby minimizing bottlenecks that lead to production delays, excess inventory and distribution network problems. 
 Business Segments 
 Segment 1Supply Chain Management

Logility derives revenues primarily from four sources: subscriptions, software licenses, services, and maintenance. Logility generally determines software license and SaaS fees based on the depth of functionality, number of production deployments, users and/or sites licensed. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, consulting services associated with the implementation and support of Logility products. Logility bills for these services primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognizes revenues as it performs services. SaaS, hosting, managed services and maintenance agreements typically are for a one- to three-year term, commencing at the time of the initial product license. Logility generally bills maintenance fees annually in advance under agreements with terms of one to three years, and then recognizes the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. Deferred revenues represent advance payments or billings for subscriptions, software licenses, services and maintenance billed in advance of the time Logility recognizes the related revenues. 
 Logilitys cost of revenues for licenses includes amortization of developed technology and capitalized computer software development costs, salaries and benefits along with VAR commissions. Costs for maintenance and services revenues include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations, customer support and consulting, and other personnel-related expenses as well as agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect sales channel. 
 Logilitys selling expenses generally include the salaries and commissions it pays to its direct sales professionals, along with marketing, promotion, travel and associated costs. Logilitys general and administrative expenses generally include the salaries and benefits it pays to executive, corporate and support personnel, as well as office rent, utilities, communications expenses, and various professional fees. 
 Demand Management, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Logility, was incorporated in 1985. Demand Management is a leading global provider of supply chain planning software that is designed to be deployed in the cloud, however some customers may deploy on premise.

 Demand Management markets and sells the Demand Solutions® DSX to brand owners, manufacturers and distributors seeking an efficient supply chain management system delivering a single platform designed for rapid deployment and a simplified operational experience. 
 Supply Chain and Retail Industry Background 
 In response to omni-channel and the new Unified Commerce reality (consumers expectations to buy anywhere, deliver anywhere and return anywhere), increasing global competition, volatile market demand, shorter product life cycles, reduced lead times, and the consumers expectations for responsibly sourced materials; companies are continually seeking new ways to enhance the productivity, profitability and compliance of their supply chain and retail operations. Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners within the extended enterprise network or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, greater customer loyalty, reduced stock-outs, more efficient sourcing, reduced inventory levels, synchronized supply and demand, and increased revenue. Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex global network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners (customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers) to forecast, source, manufacture, store, allocate and deliver goods and services to the end customer. Supply chain management involves the activities related to merchandizing, sourcing, and supplying products or services (source, make, move, buy, store, and deliver) as well as the sales and marketing activities that influence the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. 
 Today, several market trends are driving organizations to invest in supply chain and retail planning initiatives. Global economic conditions and competitive pressures are forcing companies to focus on customer desires while reducing costs, decreasing order cycle times and improving operating efficiencies along with omni-channel and Unified Commerce initiatives that are driving the need for more flexibility and better leverage of inventory to meet the needs of customers which include wholesale, branded retail and direct to consumer channels. As a result, manufacturers, brand owners, distributors and retailers are under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to reduce costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and accelerate logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands. These pressures are compounded by the increasing complexity and globalization of the interactions among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers.

Companies are increasingly deploying supply chain optimization, supply chain management, sourcing and advanced retail planning applications to address their forecasting, supply chain planning, inventory optimization, allocation and distribution requirements. Supply chain optimization and retail planning functions involve the use of information and analysis to facilitate the on-time delivery of the right products to the correct location at the right time and at the optimal total cost. The planning process focuses on forecasting and demand management, inventory and supply optimization, distribution, manufacturing planning and scheduling, sales and operations planning, and retail financial planning and allocation. Supply chain management involves product life cycle management (PLM), sourcing and compliance to get the right products that meets consumer expectations to market on time. Planning software is designed to increase revenues, improve forecast accuracy, optimize manufacturing scheduling, better leverage inventory investments, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs, and improve customer service. Customers are showing increasing interest in planning, sourcing and optimization software that is implemented and accessed in the cloud, known as SaaS. 
 The supply chain functions also address sourcing, fulfilling orders, distributing products, and delivery to customers throughout the global network. Within the supply chain execution function, organizations are increasing their focus on vendor compliance and sourcing linked with supply chain planning and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in both the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors. These multi-enterprise supply chains have heightened the need for robust supply chain master data management (MDM) to provide an accurate digital twin of the supply chain network, allowing enterprise businesses to plan strategically and quickly and accurately respond to dynamic market conditions to harness business opportunities and mitigate risk. 
 The March 28, 2018 Gartner Inc. report, Forecast: Enterprise Application Software, Worldwide 2016-2022, 1Q18 Update, predicts spending on Supply Chain Management software solutions will exceed $15 billion by 2019 and $20 billion by 2022. This represents a CAGR of 9.7% through 2022. 
 In order to effectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require demand planning, supply planning, inventory optimization, global sourcing product lifecycle management, compliance, retail merchandise planning and allocation, master data management and advanced analytics software that provides for integrated communication, optimization and collaboration among the various stakeholders throughout the supply chain network. This enhanced collaboration optimizes supply chain operations and minimizes bottlenecks that lead to production delays, excess inventory, storage constraints, distribution network problems and out of stock conditions. 
 We believe that traditional ERP systems alone do not provide the visibility, depth, flexibility or optimization techniques required to effectively meet the planning demands of todays intensely competitive and increasingly dynamic global business environment. Organizations are demanding supply chain solutions that are both modular and scalable to extend ERP functionality, fit the dynamic needs of their businesses, deploy quickly and deliver rapid time-to-benefit.
Additionally, business drivers for more sophisticated supply chain solutions are finding their way downstream. Issues that multi-billion dollar companies faced ten years ago are impacting even the lower end of the under-served SME market today. Increasingly, Logilitys customers have to manage offshore sourcing and manufacturing requirements, which often extend lead times and time-to-market. With new, increasingly complex data management needs to monitor global supply networks and deal with the retailers demand for accurate forecasts, greater supply visibility and higher in-stock performance, the SME market is outgrowing spreadsheets for supply chain planning and turning to proven supply and demand, inventory and replenishment management software, thus extending the addressable market for Logilitys software offerings. 
 Logility Products and Services 
 Leveraging more than 45 years of planning solutions expertise, Logility has been an innovator in developing and deploying supply chain optimization and advanced retail planning solutions, with its first Internet-based collaborative planning software application implemented in 1996. Logility continues to invest and expand its award-winning solutions, which support the global planning, optimization, collaboration, S&OP as well as merchandise and assortment planning and allocations for retailers. 
 Logilitys experience indicates that distribution-intensive industries face considerable competitive pressure, which is intensified by the high cost of inventory and distribution investments, dynamically changing consumer needs, and variability in overall supply chain performance. These companies need solutions that are capable of delivering significant financial benefits by quickly solving problems that arise in sourcing, manufacturing and distribution operations. Logility solutions are capable of helping these companies collaborate with their trading partners to improve customer service and optimize their sourcing, manufacturing, inventory, distribution and retail networks.

 Our enterprise solutions are the culmination of more than four decades of customer-driven supply chain functionality providing comprehensive global solutions that link critical functions throughout an enterprise. All of our enterprise solutions support our e-business functions. 
 The e-Intelliprise solution is a web-based ERP system that a customer can run over the Internet, or on their intranet or extranet utilizing the IBM iSeries servers. This allows functions within the ERP system to be easily deployed over the Internet using a dynamic role-based web page capability. Customers can support multiple e-businesses and traditional businesses with full front-to-back office integration, which is critical to successful fulfillment and seamless processing and reporting throughout the enterprise. The e-Intelliprise solution is a global system, capable of operating in multiple languages, financial and logistics organizations. e-Intelliprise was developed on a flexible enterprise architecture that enables centralized management of enterprise wide processes while allowing delegation of other business process decisions to other levels of the organization. 
 Our e-applications are solutions for conducting business on the Internet that can web-enable specific business functions through integration with existing ERP or legacy systems. Currently, e-applications are available for the following applications: e-procurement, e-store, e-expenses, e-forms, Purchase Order Tracking and Vendor Collaboration, Requisition Tracking, Shipment Tracking, e-process management and e-connect, a seamless, XML-enabled data exchange.

We do not have a customer who has more than 10% of fiscal 2018 revenues. We typically experience a slight degree of seasonality, reflected in a slowing of services revenues during the annual winter holiday season, which occurs in the third quarter of our fiscal year. We are not reliant on government-sector customers. 
 Integrated System Design 
 While customers can use our software applications individually, we have designed them to be combined as integrated systems to meet unique customer requirements. The user may select virtually any combination of modules to form an integrated solution for a particular business problem. The license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi-module, multiple-user solution incorporating the full range of our products. 
 Customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support/maintenance agreement. To meet those customers needs, we established a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting, on-site installation, system-to-system interfacing and extensive training. We provide these services, frequently referred to as systems integration services, for an additional fee, normally under a separate contract based upon time and materials utilized. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We globally market our products through direct and indirect sales channels. We conduct our principal sales and marketing activities from corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and have North American sales and/or support offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, New York, St. Louis, Miami, Pittsburgh and San Diego. We manage sales and/or support outside of North America from our international offices in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, The Netherlands, India, New Zealand and Australia. 
 In addition to our employee sales force, we have developed a network of Value Added Resellers (VAR) who assist in selling our products globally. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. These independent distributors and resellers, located in North America, South America, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region, distribute our product lines domestically and in foreign countries. These vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with contracts for our products. Our global distribution channel consists of approximately 36 organizations with sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in more than 80 countries. 
 We support our sales activities by conducting a variety of marketing programs including public relations, direct marketing, advertising, trade shows, product seminars, industry speakers, user group conferences and ongoing customer communication and industry analyst programs. We also participate in industry conferences such as those organized by the Association for Operations Management (APICS), the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), formerly called the Council of Logistics Management (CLM), and the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). 
 We also engage in third-party software alliance programs with other software vendors. These programs generally provide some type of assistance for developing or marketing software products, which are compatible or complimentary with products of the other party. Under one such program, DMI was designated a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner to provide integrated supply chain products for Microsofts Dynamics GP and NAV solutions. 
 Licenses and Subscriptions 
 Like many business application software firms, our software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licensing our software products. In consideration of the payment of license fees, we typically grant non-exclusive, nontransferable, perpetual licenses, which are primarily business segment- and user-specific and geographically restricted. Our standard license agreement contains provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software. In these agreements, we warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation. 
 The prices for our products are typically functions of the depth of functionality, number of production deployments, users and sites for which the solution is deployed. 
 A growing segment of product revenue is coming from Software as a Service (SaaS) contracts where the SaaS subscription fees are based on the depth of functionality, number of production deployments, users and/or sites licensed.

Customer Service and Support 
 We provide the following services and support to our customers: 
 Cloud and Managed Services. We offer our customers the option to deploy Voyager, Demand Solutions and New Generation Solutions in a SaaS, hosted or on-premise model. Cloud Services provides companies a choice in deployment methodology and services that best suit their individual needs and allows them to evolve as their business changes; moving between SaaS, on-premise, and managed services as their IT strategies transform. Managed Services leverage our resources to assist and augment the customers technical and operational needs on a day-to-day basis. 
 Implementation Support. We offer our customers a professional and proven implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products. Our consultants help customers define the nature of their project and subsequently proceed through the implementation process. We provide training for all users and managers involved. We first establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation. Additional services beyond implementation can include post-implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to customers. 
 Implementation: General Training Services. We offer our customers post-delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services, for which we typically charge on a daily basis. Customers that purchase implementation services receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing software applications and databases. Implementation of our products typically requires three to nine months, depending on factors such as the complexity of a customers existing systems, the number of modules purchased, and the number of end users. 
 Product Maintenance and Updates: Support Services. We provide our customers with ongoing product support services. Typically, we enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one- to three-year term, billed annually in advance, at the time of the product license with renewal for additional periods thereafter. Under these contracts, we provide telephone consulting, product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. We provide ongoing support and maintenance services on a seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day basis through telephone, electronic mail and web-based support, using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance. 
 Research and Development 
 Our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet. 
 Logilitys current release of Logility Voyager Solutions is version 1704, released in January 2018. Version 1704 uses a cloud-based architecture for maximum scalability and messaging functionality that supports the increasingly distributed nature of supply chain planning, global sourcing, supply chain execution, collaborative commerce and advanced retail planning. Logility Voyager Solutions interfaces with software from leading ERP vendors such as SAP, Oracle and Infor through its industry leading supply chain MDM solution, Logility Voyager AdapLink which offers data validation, harmonized transformation simplified with standardized integration templates. 
 The current release of the traditional Demand Solutions products is DSX which was introduced in January 2014. These products are designed to work with a wide variety of MRP, ERP and legacy enterprise applications. 
 Our cloud-architected solutions designed for SaaS deployment with master data management built in will be important for our long-term growth. As of April 30, 2018, we employed 98 persons in product research, development and enhancement activities. 
 Competition 
 Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain, retail and general enterprise application market. Our existing competitors include but are not limited to: 

 | Large ERP application software vendors such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, each of which offers sophisticated ERP solutions that currently, or may in the future, incorporate supply chain management, advanced planning and scheduling, warehouse management, transportation, collaboration or sales and operations planning software modules;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15 
 

 | Vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market, including, but not limited to, vendors such as JDA Software, ToolsGroup and Kinaxis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of, supply chain management software; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for advanced retail planning and supply chain management software and/or introduce new products and technologies. In addition, current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. 
 The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products and related services such as customer support, training and implementation services. Other factors important to customers and prospects include: 
 

 | customer service and satisfaction;
--+-----------------------------------


 | ability to provide relevant customer references;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with industry-specific requirements and standards;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to generate business benefits;
--+---------------------------------------


 | rapid payback and measurable return on investment;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | vendor financial stability and company as well as product reputation; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | initial license price, cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, and a larger installed base of customers than we have. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices, payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. In order to be successful in the future, we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors innovations. We may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. 
 We believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive, single platform solutions, our list of referenceable customers, the ability of our solutions to quickly generate business benefits for our customers, our substantial investment in product development, our deep domain expertise, the ease of use of our software products, our customer support and implementation services, our ability to deploy quickly, and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our customers. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, which may afford only limited protection. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws, we also believe that factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Generally, copyrights on our products expire 95 years after the year of first publication of each product. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and customers, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information and deliver only object code (compiled source code) to our customers. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks. 
 
16 
 
We provide our software products to customers under non-exclusive license agreements. As is customary in the software industry, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers. Although the license agreements place restrictions on the customers use of our products, unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur. 
 Despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 In the future, we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. In addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such claims against us, with or without merit, as well as claims initiated by us against third parties, can be time consuming and expensive to defend, prosecute or resolve. Moreover, an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require a substantial amount of attention from management, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. To the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 We have re-licensed, and expect in the future to re-license, certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products. There can be no assurance that these third-party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The termination of any such licenses or product offerings, or the failure of the third-party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products, could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources. Any required replacement licenses could prove costly. Further, any such delay, if it becomes extended, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Company Strategy 
 Our objective is to become a leading provider of collaborative supply chain optimization, advanced retail planning and supply chain management solutions to enable small, midsize, large and Fortune 500 companies to optimize their operations associated with the planning, sourcing, manufacture, storage, distribution and allocation of products. Our strategy includes the following key elements: 
 Leverage and Expand Installed Base of Customers. We currently target businesses in the consumer goods, food and beverage, retail, apparel and sewn products, life sciences, chemicals, and wholesale distribution industries. We intend to continue to leverage our installed base of more than 1,250 customers to introduce additional functionality, product upgrades, and complementary modules. In addition, we intend to expand sales to new customers in our existing vertical markets and to target additional vertical markets over time. We will continue our focus on offering a best-in-class cloud solution and expect the growth trends we have experienced in this area to continue because many new and existing customers are pursuing cloud strategies for their business applications. 
 Continue to Expand Sales and Marketing. We intend to continue to pursue an increased share of the market for supply chain software solutions by expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe our competitive advantages include providing rapid implementation, easy-to-maintain configuration, and quick time-to-benefit across the full spectrum of customer operations. Logility intends to continue building a direct sales force that is focused on selected vertical markets, such as consumer goods, retail, life sciences, wholesale distribution and manufacturing supply chains. NGC Software intends to continue to focus on the fashion product industries such as apparel, footwear, sewn products, and furniture, adding sales and marketing resources when appropriate. 
 Expand Indirect Channels to Increase Market Penetration. We believe that key relationships with VARs will increase sales and expand market penetration of our products and services. This experienced global distribution network significantly expands Logilitys reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in more than 80 countries. 
 
17 
 
Maintain Technology Leadership. We believe we are a technology leader in the field of collaborative supply chain optimization solutions and advanced business analytics. We intend to continue to provide innovative, advanced solutions and services to this market. We believe that Logility was one of the earliest providers of SCM software solutions on a client/server platform and on Windows, and the first to introduce a collaborative supply chain planning solution that operates over the Internet. We intend to continue developing and introducing new and enhanced products and keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. 
 Invest Aggressively to Build Market Share. We intend to continue investing to expand our sales force, research and development efforts, and consulting infrastructure, balanced with our goal of increasing profitability. We believe these investments are necessary to increase our market share and to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the market. 
 Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses, Products and Technologies. We believe that select acquisitions or investments may provide opportunities to broaden our product offering to provide more advanced solutions for our target markets. We will evaluate acquisitions or investments that will provide us with complementary products and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, penetrate additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently meet, and further solidify our leadership position within the SCM market. In fiscal 2015, we acquired MID Retail, Inc. (MRI), announced on May 30, 2014, to extend our reach into retail operations and expand our ability to help customers improve their Omni-Channel performance. On August 23, 2016 we announced the acquisition of AdapChain to provide supply chain Master Data Management and streamlined integration between our portfolio of planning and optimization solutions to third party software applications. In fiscal 2018, we acquired certain assets of privately held Innovare Holding Co., Incorporated, a Delaware corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Halo) effective November 21, 2017. Halo is a supplier of advanced analytics and business intelligence solutions, for the supply chain market. . These enriched analytics will leverage interactive visualization, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI) to transform both structured and unstructured data to accelerate business planning performance and proactively identify new business opportunities or mitigate risks. 
 Focus on Integrated Collaborative Planning and Supply Chain Execution Solution. We believe Logility is one of the few providers of truly integrated SCM software solutions addressing demand, supply and advanced retail planning as well as transportation logistics requirements. Logility Voyager Solutions provides a comprehensive suite for supply chain planning and transportation management with collaboration at its core, streamlining business processes between both internal and external trading partners. We intend to continue focusing Logilitys development initiatives on enhancing its end-to-end solution, expanding its embedded performance management architecture and introducing additional capabilities that complement its integrated solution suite. 
 Increase Penetration of International Markets. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2018, we generated 19% of our total revenues from international sales, resulting from marketing relationships with a number of international distributors. Logility, along with its subsidiary, DMI, has over 36 VARs in its indirect channel where the majority of the VARs are international. This experienced global distribution network expands Logilitys reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources, serving customers in more than 80 countries. We intend to further expand our international presence by creating additional relationships with distributors in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. 
 Expand Strategic Relationships. We intend to develop strategic relationships with leading enterprise software, systems integrators and service providers to integrate our software solutions into their services and products and to create joint marketing opportunities. In addition, Logility has developed a network of international agents who assist in the sale and support of its products. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. 
 Continue to Focus on Providing High Quality Customer Service. Providing high quality customer service is a critical element of our strategy. We intend to continue investing in technology and personnel to accommodate the needs of our growing customer base. We will continue to seek new ways to improve service to our customers. 
 Leverage Cloud Strategy. Our cloud computing initiative accelerates customers deployment of our industry leading supply chain and advanced retail planning solutions. Our cloud strategy includes SaaS licensing and services designed to enable the optimization of the customers supply chain to reflect their global business needs. 
 Serve Small, Midsize and Large Business Markets. Our broad product portfolio allows us to address the unique business needs and complexity of a wide range of enterprises with small, midsize and large global operations. 
 There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in implementing the strategies outlined above.
