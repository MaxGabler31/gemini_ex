Our operating subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the research, development, manufacture, sale and support of the products and systems described below. Their respective businesses are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” See also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Forward-Looking Information.”
We are continually seeking ways to reduce our overall operating costs, streamline business processes and enhance the branding of our products and services. For example, during 2020 Doble consolidated its headquarters operations into a single, more cost-efficient facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and in 2021 it closed its facility in Toronto, Ontario and consolidated its Manta product line into its existing production capacity for Doble instruments.
We are also continually seeking opportunities to supplement our growth by making strategic acquisitions. In October 2020 we acquired Advanced Technology Machining, Inc. (ATM) and its sister company TECC Grinding, Inc.; in July 2021 we acquired I.S.A Altanova Group S.r.l. and its affiliated companies (Altanova); in August 2021 we acquired the assets of Phenix Technologies Inc. (Phenix); and in November 2021 we acquired Networks Electronic Company, LLC (NEco), a provider of miniature electro-explosive components and subsystems supporting mission, flight, and life-critical applications to the aerospace and defense end-markets. Information about these acquired businesses is provided in the following section, “Products,” and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2019, we sold the businesses comprising our former Technical Packaging segment and used the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and for other corporate purposes. The Technical Packaging segment was reported as Discontinued Operations in 2020. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Products
Our principal products are described below. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information regarding business segments and 10% customers.
A&D
Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we renamed our Filtration/Fluid Flow segment as Aerospace & Defense to better reflect the composition of the segment’s products, end markets and customer characteristics. The A&D segment’s individual legal and operating entities and historical financial results are unchanged from what was formerly presented as Filtration/Fluid Flow.
The A&D segment accounted for approximately 41%, 44% and 48% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This segment has seven facilities in the United States and one in Mexico.
Our companies within this segment primarily design and manufacture specialty filtration, fluid control and naval products, including hydraulic filter elements, fluid control devices, and precision-tolerance machined components used in aerospace and defense applications, unique filter mechanisms used in micro-propulsion devices for satellites, custom designed filters for manned aircraft and submarines, products and systems to reduce vibration and/or acoustic signatures and otherwise reduce or obscure a vessel’s signature, and other communications, sealing, surface control and hydrodynamic related applications to enhance U.S. Navy maritime survivability; and miniature electro-explosive devices for military aircraft ejection seats and missile arming devices.
USG
Our USG segment accounted for approximately 32%, 28% and 26% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This segment has seven facilities in the United States, one in Canada, and eight outside North America.
Doble is an industry leader in the development, manufacture and delivery of diagnostic testing and data management solutions that enable electric power grid operators to assess the integrity of high-voltage power delivery equipment. It combines three core elements for customers – diagnostic test instruments and condition monitoring systems, expert consulting, and testing services. The acquisition of Phenix’s assets has enhanced Doble’s high voltage, high current, high power test systems, components and solutions. NRG is a global market leader in the design and manufacture of decision support tools for the renewable energy industry, primarily wind and solar. 

2



Altanova, headquartered in Taino, Italy, provides products and services in more than 100 countries. Its strong market share in Europe and Asia creates a significant international platform for our USG segment and fills important product gaps and geographies not previously served by our existing products and solutions. Doble’s offices outside North America have been consolidated with Altanova’s, and going forward we expect that Altanova will represent their combined businesses in markets outside the U.S. and Canada.
Test
Our Test segment accounted for approximately 27%, 28% and 26% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This segment has four facilities in the United States and six outside the United States.
ETS-Lindgren is an industry leader in designing and manufacturing products which provide its customers with the ability to measure and contain magnetic, electromagnetic and acoustic energy. It supplies its customers with a broad range of isolated environments and turnkey systems, including RF test facilities, acoustic test enclosures, RF and magnetically shielded rooms, secure communication facilities, RF measurement systems and broadcast and recording studios. Many of these facilities include proprietary features such as shielded doors and windows. ETS-Lindgren also provides the design, program management, installation and integration services required to successfully complete these types of facilities.
ETS-Lindgren also supplies customers with a broad range of components including RF absorptive materials, RF filters, active compensation systems, antennas, antenna masts, turntables and electric and magnetic probes, RF test cells, proprietary measurement software and other test accessories required to perform a variety of tests. ETS-Lindgren offers a variety of services including calibration for antennas and field probes, chamber certification, field surveys, customer training and a variety of product tests. ETS-Lindgren’s test labs are accredited by the following organizations: American Association for Laboratory Accreditation, National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program and CTIA-The Wireless Association Accredited Test Lab. ETS-Lindgren serves the acoustics, medical, health and safety, electronics, wireless communications, automotive and defense markets. 
Marketing and Sales
Our products generally are distributed to customers through a domestic and foreign network of distributors, sales representatives, direct sales teams and in-house sales personnel.
Our sales to international customers accounted for approximately 30%, 28% and 27% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by geographic area. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of risks related to our international operations.

Government Contracts
Some of our products are sold to the U.S. Government either directly under contracts with the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as other Government agencies or indirectly under subcontracts with their prime contractors. Direct and indirect sales to the U.S. Government, primarily related to the A&D segment, accounted for approximately 27%, 26% and 28% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our Government contracts primarily include firm fixed-price contracts under which work is performed and paid for at a fixed amount without adjustment for the actual costs experienced in connection with the contracts. All Government prime contracts and virtually all of our Government subcontracts provide that they may be terminated at the convenience of the Government or the customer. Upon a termination for convenience, we are entitled to receive equitable compensation from the customer for the work we completed prior to termination.
All of our facilities are in material compliance with appliable COVID-related Government regulations and executive orders.
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of risks related to our Government business.

Intellectual Property
We own or have other rights in various forms of intellectual property (i.e., patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, mask works, trade secrets and other items). As a major supplier of engineered products to industrial and commercial markets, we emphasize developing intellectual property and protecting our rights therein. However, the legal protection afforded by intellectual property rights is often uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual issues. Some intellectual property rights, such as patents, have a 

3



limited term, and there can be no assurance that third parties will not infringe or design around our intellectual property. Policing the unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult, and infringement and misappropriation are persistent problems for many companies, particularly in some international markets, and in some cases, we may elect not to pursue an unauthorized user due to the high costs and uncertainties associated with litigation. Further, there can be no assurance that courts will ultimately hold issued patents or other intellectual property valid and enforceable. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
A number of products in the Aerospace & Defense segment are based on patented or otherwise proprietary technology that sets them apart from the competition, such as VACCO’s proprietary quieting technology and Westland’s signature reduction solutions. In addition, Globe has developed significant manufacturing and logistics capability useful for special hull treatments for submarines. 
In the USG segment, our policy is to seek patent and/or other forms of intellectual property protection on new and improved products, components of products, and methods of operation for our businesses, as such developments are made. Doble has obtained and is pursuing additional patent protection on improvements to its line of diagnostic equipment and NERC CIP compliance tools and its newly-introduced Calisto R9 dissolved gas analyzer. Doble also holds an extensive library of apparatus performance information useful to entities that generate, distribute or consume electric energy, and it makes part of this library available to registered users via an Internet portal. Altonova has obtained and is pursuing additional patent protection on instruments and methods for detecting partial discharges in electrical apparatus. NRG has intellectual property related to certain LIDAR technology and applications, and has obtained and is pursuing additional patent protection on its line of bat deterrent systems, which are designed to significantly reduce bat mortality at windfarms and in other applications where bat conservation is a concern.
In the Test segment, we have sought patent protection for significant inventions. Examples of such inventions include novel designs for window and door assemblies used in shielded enclosures and anechoic chambers, improved acoustic techniques for sound isolation and a variety of unique antennas. In addition, the Test segment holds a number of patents, and has patents pending, on products used to perform wireless device testing.
We consider our patents and other intellectual property to be of significant value to each of our segments.

Backlog
Total Company backlog of firm orders at September 30, 2022 was $695.0 million, representing an increase of $103.0 million (17.4%) from the backlog of $592.0 million at September 30, 2021. By segment, the backlog at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, was $408.3 million and $367.2 million for A&D; $128.1 million and $91.6 million for USG; and $158.6 million and $133.2. million for Test. We estimate that as of September 30, 2022 domestic customers accounted for approximately 70% of our total firm orders and international customers accounted for approximately 30%. Of our total backlog at September 30, 2022, approximately 80% is expected to be completed in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.

Purchased Components and Raw Materials
Our products require a wide variety of components and materials. Although we have multiple sources of supply for most of our materials requirements, certain components and raw materials are supplied by sole source vendors, and our ability to perform certain contracts depends on their timely performance. In the past, these required raw materials and various purchased components generally have been available in sufficient quantities. However, we do have some risk of shortages of materials or components due to reliance on sole or limited sources of supply; and supplies of components and materials are periodically impacted by supply chain disruptions, as well as complications due to current or future trade policies. Where feasible, we engineer and qualify substitute products to avoid short-term supply issues; however, we are subject to the same supply chain risks as other electronics manufacturers. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver our products on-time and to meet the expectations of our customers. Additionally, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, an increase in the costs of doing business, including increasing raw material prices and transportation costs, which have and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our A&D segment purchases supplies from a wide array of vendors. In most instances, multiple vendors of raw materials are screened during a qualification process to ensure that there will not be an interruption of supply should one of them underperform or discontinue operations. Nonetheless, in some situations, there is a risk of shortages due to reliance on a limited number of suppliers or because of price fluctuations due to the nature of the raw materials. For example, aerospace-grade titanium and gaseous helium, important raw materials for our A&D segment subsidiaries, may at times be in short supply.
Our USG segment manufactures electronic instrumentation through a network of regional contract manufacturers under long-term contracts. In general, USG purchases the same kinds of component parts as do other electronic products manufacturers, and these 

4



electronic components can be subject to supply chain constraints. USG purchases only a limited amount of raw materials, although some USG products require helium, which may at times be in short supply.
Our Test segment is a vertically integrated supplier of electro-magnetic (EM) shielding and RF absorbing products, producing most of its critical RF components itself. This segment purchases significant quantities of raw materials such as polyurethane foam, polystyrene beads, steel, aluminum, copper, nickel and wood. Accordingly, it is subject to price fluctuations in the worldwide raw materials markets. While ETS-Lindgren has long-term contracts with a number of its suppliers, performance of these contracts is vulnerable to the risks described in Item 1A.

Competition
Competition in our major markets is broadly based and global in scope. This competition can be particularly intense during periods of economic slowdown, and we have experienced this in some of our markets. Although we are a leading supplier in several of the markets we serve, we maintain a relatively small share of the business in many of our other markets. Individual competitors range in size from annual revenues of less than $1 million to billion-dollar enterprises. Because of the specialized nature of our products, our competitive position with respect to our products cannot be precisely stated. In our major served markets, competition is driven primarily by quality, technology, price and delivery performance. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Primary competitors of our A&D segment include Pall Corporation, Moog, Inc., Safran (Sofrance), CLARCOR Inc., TransDigm (PneuDraulics), Marotta Controls, and Parker Hannifin.
Significant competitors of our USG segment include OMICRON electronics Corp., Megger Group Limited, Vaisala, and Qualitrol Company LLC (a subsidiary of Fortive Corporation).
Our Test segment is a global leader in EM shielding. Significant competitors in this market include Rohde & Schwarz GMBH, Microwave Vision SA (MVG), TDK RF Solutions Inc., Albatross GmbH, IMEDCO AG, and Universal Shielding Corp.

Research and Development
Research and development and our technological expertise are important factors in our business. Our research and development programs are designed to develop technology for new products or to extend or upgrade the capability of existing products, and to enhance their commercial potential. We perform research and development at our own expense, and also engage in research and development funded by our customers. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about our research and development expenditures.

Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup relating to environmental matters. It is difficult to estimate the potential costs of these matters and the possible impact of these costs on the Company at this time due in part to: the uncertainty regarding the extent of pollution; the complexity and changing nature of Government laws and regulations and their interpretations; the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; the uncertain level of insurance or other types of cost recovery; the uncertain level of our responsibility for any contamination; the possibility of joint and several liability with other contributors under applicable law; and the ability of other contributors to make required contributions toward cleanup costs. Based on information currently available, we do not believe that the aggregate costs involved in the resolution of environmental matters or compliance with Governmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Human Capital Management
As of September 30, 2022, we employed 2,922 persons, including 2,894 full time employees 18% of whom were located in 17 foreign countries.
We strive to be a responsible member of the communities in which we operate, and we are dedicated to preserving operational excellence and remaining an employer of choice. We provide and maintain a work environment that attracts, develops and retains top talent by offering our employees an engaging work experience that contributes to their career development. Through our charitable Foundation and wellness activities we provide opportunities for civic involvement that not only support our communities and provides our employees with meaningful experiences that promote collaborative and rewarding work environments. We strive to maintain a culture that enables all employees to be treated with dignity and respect while performing their jobs to the best of their abilities. We 

5



operate in a supportive culture that incorporates strong ethical behavior and reinforces our human rights commitment through annual training on ethics, human rights, anti-human trafficking and anti-harassment.
Our subsidiaries enjoy modest turnover at about half the national average for our industry. Fewer than 6% of our workforce are contingent workers. We invest in creating a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment which will inspire our employees to give their best efforts every day. In fact, nearly half of our employee base comes from diverse backgrounds.
We generally conduct formal compensation benchmarking reviews every 1-2 years to ensure wages are competitive in local markets and support our retention and recruiting efforts. Additionally, we invest time and resources in reviewing pay equity within our workforce. The majority of full-time domestic and international employees are eligible for bonus or commission plans, most of which are designed to incentivize and reward performance based on results such as EPS, EBIT, cash flow, quality and backlog reduction, or other measures.
We recognize that our success is based on the talents and dedication of those we employ, and we are invested in their success. Significant investments are made in the areas of talent development, technical skills and compliance training in areas such as supervisor training, employee coaching, ethics, safety, hazmat, ITAR, etc. For succession planning purposes, we focus on identifying high-potential future leaders and working with them on individual development plans and executive coaching.
Attracting and retaining a talented workforce is of utmost importance. Given the ever-changing talent market, we have looked to broaden the ways in which we can recognize and reward performance, including more frequent merit increases, market adjustments, spot bonuses, and other creative ways to recognize and reward employees. While utilizing these and other measures, at the end of our fiscal year the average tenure of our workforce was nine years. One third of employees have been with us for 10 or more years and more than 50% of employees have been with us for five or more years.
We are committed to the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families by encouraging participation in wellness programs. Generally, all our full-time employees, both domestic and international, are offered health and welfare benefits. We remain committed to our communities through financial support from our employees and the ESCO Foundation, and through personal participation of our employees with a variety of local organizations, such as food banks, blood drives, the Boys & Girls Club, and Habitat for Humanity. We believe strong human capital is a competitive differentiator, and we focus on ensuring we have the right domestic and international talent in place to drive our strategic initiatives not only today but well into the future.
