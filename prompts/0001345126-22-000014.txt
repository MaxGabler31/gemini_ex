ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Compass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust (“Holdings”, or the “Trust”), was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “LLC”), was also formed on November 18, 2005. The Trust and the LLC (collectively, the “Company”) were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. The Trust is the sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests, as defined in our LLC Agreement, of the LLC. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Trust owns an identical number of Trust Interests in the LLC as exist for the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. 
The Trust was previously treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes but elected, effective September 1, 2021, to be taxed as an association taxable as a corporation. Following this tax election, Trust shareholders should generally only be subject to taxation from holding Trust shares in connection with disposition of Trust shares and receipt of taxable dividends from the Trust. Trust shareholders subject to tax rules regarding “unrelated business taxable income” (or “UBTI”) will no longer be allocated UBTI from the Trust. 
The LLC is the operating entity with a board of directors whose corporate governance responsibilities are similar to that of a Delaware corporation. The LLC’s board of directors oversees the management of the Company and our businesses and the performance of Compass Group Management LLC (“CGM” or our “Manager”). Certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation as beneficial owners of 57.8% through Sostratus LLC of the Allocation Interests in us, as defined in our LLC Agreement.
Overview
We acquire controlling interests in and actively manage businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, (ii) have positive and stable cash flows, (iii) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence, and (iv) have strong management teams largely in place. We offer investors a unique opportunity to own a diverse group of leading middle-market businesses in the niche-industrial and branded-consumer sectors. 
Our disciplined approach to our target markets provides opportunities to methodically purchase attractive businesses at values that are accretive to our shareholders. For sellers of businesses, our unique financial structure allows us to acquire businesses efficiently with little or no third party financing contingencies and, following acquisition, to provide our businesses with substantial access to growth capital. In addition, our permanent capital model and ample liquidity allows us to acquire businesses at any point across economic cycles, ensuring that we are able to act quickly when the opportunity presents itself to do so and that we’re not paralyzed when markets are volatile. 
We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their business units may consider us an attractive purchaser because of our ability to:
•provide ongoing strategic and financial support for their businesses, including professionalization of our subsidiaries at scale;
•maintain a long-term outlook as to the ownership of those businesses; 
•sustainably invest in growth capital and/or add-on acquisitions where appropriate; and
•consummate transactions efficiently without being dependent on third-party transaction financing.
In particular, we believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many private company operators and parent companies may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses. 
Finally, it has been our experience, that our ability to acquire businesses without the cumbersome delays and conditions typical of third party transactional financing is appealing to sellers of businesses who are interested in confidentiality, speed and certainty to close.
We believe our management team’s strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us substantial opportunities to assess small to middle market businesses available for acquisition. In addition, the 
flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.
In terms of the businesses in which we have a controlling interest as of December 31, 2021, we believe that these businesses have strong management teams, operate in strong markets with defensible market niches and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") tailwinds, and maintain long-standing customer relationships. 
We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups (i) branded consumer businesses and, (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product categories. Niche industrial businesses are those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sectors.

Tax Reporting
On August 3, 2021, the shareholders of CODI approved amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust and the Fifth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Company to allow the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to cause the Trust to elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “tax reclassification”) and, at its discretion in the future, cause the Trust to be converted to a corporation. Following the shareholder vote, the Board resolved to cause the Trust to elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust was taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes since January 1, 2007 and until the tax reclassification became effective on September 1, 2021.
The Trust will be treated as a corporation for any taxable period beginning on or after the tax reclassification. Income, gain, loss, deduction and credit from the Trust will no longer be passed through to the Trust shareholders. The Trust will issue its final Schedule K-1s for the taxable period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending August 31, 2021, the last day on which the Trust was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thereafter the Trust will stop issuing annual Form 1065, Schedule K-1s and Trust shareholders will no longer be subject to current taxation on the Trust’s earnings. Trust shareholders subject to rules regarding “unrelated business taxable income” (or “UBTI”) will no longer be allocated UBTI from the Trust.
The Trust will be required to file Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return on an annual basis and for all taxable periods beginning on or after the tax reclassification. In addition, distribution with respect to Trust shares (including Trust preferred shares) will now be reported on Form 1099-DIV, instead of on Schedule K-1.
WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC" or the "Commission"), including Forms S-1 and S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which include exhibits, schedules and amendments to those reports, as well as other filings required by the SEC.

Our Manager
Our Manager, CGM, has been engaged to manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and to execute our strategy, as discussed below. Collectively, our management team has extensive experience in acquiring and managing small and middle market businesses. We believe our Manager is unique in the marketplace in terms of the success and experience of its employees in acquiring and managing diverse businesses of the size and general nature of our businesses. We believe this experience will provide us with an advantage in executing our overall strategy. Our management team devotes substantially all of its time to the affairs of the Company.
We have entered into a management services agreement, (the “Management Services Agreement” or “MSA”) pursuant to which our Manager manages the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and oversees the management and operations of our businesses. We pay our Manager a quarterly management fee for the services it performs on our behalf. In addition, certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation with respect to its Allocation Interests in us. All of the Allocation Interests in us are owned by Sostratus LLC. Payment of profit allocations to Sostratus LLC can occur for each of our subsidiaries during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (a "Holding Event") to the extent contribution based profit has been earned and upon the sale of a subsidiary from which there is a realizable gain (a "Sale Event"). See Part III, Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” for further descriptions of the management fees and profit allocations.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager and have been seconded to us. Neither the Trust nor the LLC has any other employees. Although our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager, they report directly to the LLC’s board of directors. The management fee paid to our Manager covers all expenses related to the services performed by our Manager, including the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other personnel providing services to us. The LLC reimburses our Manager for the compensation and related costs and expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and his staff, who dedicate substantially all of their time to the affairs of the Company.
See Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Market Opportunity
We acquire and actively manage small and middle market businesses. We characterize small to middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $100 million per year. We believe that the acquisition market for these businesses is highly fragmented and often provides opportunities to purchase at more attractive prices and achieve better outcomes for our shareholders. We believe this is driven by the following factors:
•third-party financing for these acquisitions is often less available or terms are less favorable for the borrower;
•sellers of these businesses frequently consider non-economic factors, such as legacy or the effect of the sale on their employees;
•these businesses are more likely to be sold outside of an auction process or as part of a limited process; and
•"add-on" acquisitions can often be completed at attractive multiples of cash flow.
Frequently, opportunities exist to support and augment existing management at such businesses and improve the performance of these businesses upon their acquisition through active management. We are business builders rather than asset traders. In the past, our management team has acquired businesses that were owned by entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our management team has frequently found opportunities to profitably invest in areas of the acquired businesses beyond levels that existed at the time of acquisition. In addition, our management team has frequently found that processes such as financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, leading to improvements in reporting and operations and ultimately earnings and cash flow. Finally, our management team often acts as a business development arm for our businesses to pursue organic or external growth strategies that may not have been pursued by their previous owners.
Our Strategy 
CODI’s permanent capital structure enables us to invest in people, processes, culture, and growth opportunities that drive transformational change. We have two primary strategies that we use to support long-term value creation. First, we focus on growing the earnings and cash flow from our acquired businesses and help them professionalize at scale. We believe that the scale and scope of our businesses give us a diverse base of cash flow upon which to further build. Second, we identify, perform due diligence on, negotiate and consummate additional platform acquisitions of small to middle market businesses in attractive industry sectors in accordance with acquisition criteria established by the board of directors.
Management Strategy
Our management strategy involves the proactive financial and operational management of the businesses we own in order to increase cash flows and shareholder value. Our Manager actively oversees and supports the management teams of each of our businesses by, among other things:
•recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses using structured incentive compensation programs, including non-controlling equity ownership, tailored to each business;
•regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;
•identifying and aligning with external policy and performance tailwinds such as those influenced by growing climate, health, and social justice concerns (and similar environmental, social and governance ("ESG") drivers);
•assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies;
•identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities;
•assisting management in controlling and right-sizing overhead costs;
•nurturing an internal culture of transparency, alignment, accountability and governance, including regular reporting; 
•professionalizing our subsidiaries at scale; and
•forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.
Specifically, while our businesses have different growth opportunities and potential rates of growth, we expect our Manager to work with the management teams of each of our businesses to increase the value of, and cash generated by, each business through various initiatives, including:
•making selective capital investments to expand geographic reach, increase capacity, or reduce manufacturing costs of our businesses;
•investing in product research and development for new products, processes or services for customers;
•improving and expanding existing sales and marketing programs;
•pursuing reductions in operating costs through improved operational efficiency or outsourcing of certain processes and products; and
•consolidating or improving management of certain overhead functions.
Our businesses typically acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We believe that complementary add-on acquisitions improve our overall financial and operational performance by allowing us to:
•leverage manufacturing and distribution operations;
•leverage branding and marketing programs, as well as customer relationships;
•add experienced management or management expertise;
•increase market share and penetrate new markets; and
•realize cost synergies by allocating the corporate overhead expenses of our businesses across a larger number of businesses and by implementing and coordinating improved management practices.
Acquisition Strategy
Our acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that we expect to produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow. In this respect, we expect to make platform acquisitions in industries other than those in which our businesses currently operate if we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity. We believe that attractive opportunities will continue to present themselves, as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in long-standing and privately-held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core” operations.
Our ideal acquisition candidate has the following characteristics:
•is a leading branded consumer or niche industrial company headquartered in North America;
•maintains highly defensible position in the markets it serves and with customers;
•operates in an industry with favorable long-term macroeconomic trends;
•has a strong management team, either currently in place or previously identified, and meaningful incentives;
•has low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and
•maintains a diversified customer and supplier base.
We benefit from our Manager’s ability to identify potential diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we rely upon our management team’s experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, on our behalf, our Manager:
•engages in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence;
•critically evaluates the target management team;
•identifies and assesses any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of the target business;
•analyzes comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors;
•actively researches and evaluates information on the relevant industry; and
•thoroughly negotiates appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition.
The process of acquiring new businesses is both time-consuming and complex. Our management team historically has taken from two to twenty-four months to perform due diligence, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although our management team is at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be periods of time during which our management team does not recommend any new acquisitions to us. Even if an acquisition is recommended by our management team, our board of directors may not approve it.
A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent company level largely through our existing credit facility. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third-party financing, provides us with an advantage in successfully acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In addition, our strategy of providing this intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of principle on these intercompany loans.
Upon acquisition of a new business, we rely on our Manager’s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a successful business plan.
Strategic Advantages
Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our management team has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our management team has a successful track record of acquiring and managing small-to-middle market businesses in various industries. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our management team has been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations.
Our management team has a large network that we estimate to be approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team’s proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our management team also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our acquired businesses.
Finally, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, we expect to minimize the delays and closing conditions typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage can be a powerful one, especially in a tight credit environment, and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.
Valuation and Due Diligence
When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, our management team performs rigorous due diligence and a financial evaluations process including an evaluation of the operations of the target business and the outlook for its industry. While valuation of a business is a subjective process, we define valuations under a variety of analyses, including:
•discounted cash flow analyses;
•evaluation of trading values of comparable companies;
•expected value matrices; and
•examination of comparable recent transactions.
One outcome of this process is a projection of the expected cash flows from the target business. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that with detailed due diligence, future cash flows will be better estimated and the prospects for operating the business in the future better evaluated. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.
A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses is the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute our business plan for the target business. Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business.
Environmental, Social and Governance Practices
In the last few years, companies, investors and policymakers have focused more attention on - and have made investments in - companies that are considered leaders in ESG practices. Another way to think about ESG practices is to consider them, collectively, to be long-term performance factors designed to enable real owners to oversee their investments and balance the needs of important stakeholders in doing so. That same concept is mirrored in Compass Diversified’s business model: by bringing the virtues of a diverse set of middle market businesses that are typically privately held to public markets - including to individual investors who would not otherwise have access - we are helping to democratize market access while preserving professional oversight protections.
Our long-term, do-good-by-doing-well, real owners approach is reflected in the companies we acquire and manage, which, among them, provide products and services that support: 
•medical and first responder needs; 
•education programs; 
•outdoor health and recreational pursuits; and 
•e-commerce and technology providers. 
In addition, a number of our businesses have created robust recycling and responsible sourcing programs, strong human capital management and diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") programs. We believe each of these creates long-term financial sustainability as well as making our shared world a better place.
Our long-term responsible approach is also reflected in how we manage ourselves. We have been and remain committed to being a responsible partner to our subsidiaries and are proud stewards of corporate citizenship. 
Financing
We incur third party debt financing almost entirely at the Company level, which we use, in combination with our equity capital, to provide debt financing to each of our businesses and to acquire additional businesses. We believe this financing structure is beneficial to the financial and operational activities of each of our businesses by aligning our interests as both equity holders of, and lenders to, our businesses, in a manner that we believe is more efficient than each of our businesses borrowing from third-party lenders.
Debt Financing

The proceeds from the sale of the 2032 Notes was used to repay debt outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility.
On March 23, 2021, we consummated the issuance and sale of $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.250% Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes") offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Equity Financing
Trust Common Shares
The Trust is authorized to issue 500,000,000 Trust common shares and the Company is authorized to issue a corresponding number of LLC interests. The Company will, at all times have an equal amount of LLC interests outstanding as Trust shares. At December 31, 2021, there were 68.7 million Trust common shares outstanding.
Common Share Offering
On September 7, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may, but we have no obligation to, issue and sell up to $500 million shares of the common shares of the Trust in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions, the trading price of Trust common shares and determinations by us regarding appropriate sources of funding. In connection with this offering, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“B. Riley”) and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman”) pursuant to which we may sell common shares of the Trust having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million, from time to time through B. Riley and Goldman, acting as sales agents and/or principals. We sold 3,837,885 Trust common shares during the year ended December 31, 2021 and received net proceeds of approximately $115.1 million.

Trust Preferred Shares
The Trust is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 million Trust preferred shares and the Company is authorized to issue a corresponding number of Trust Interests.

We intend to finance future acquisitions through our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, cash on hand and, if necessary, additional equity and debt financings. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with the capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third party financing specifically related to the acquisition of individual businesses, provides us with an advantage in acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In this respect, we believe that in the future, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financings, or offer equity in Holdings or target businesses to the sellers of such target businesses, in order to fund multiple future acquisitions. 
Our Businesses
We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses, and (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.
The following table represents the percentage of net revenue and operating income each of our businesses contributed to our consolidated results since the date of acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and the total assets of each of our businesses as a percentage of the consolidated total as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Today, 5.11 continues to design and innovate for these professionals with the added purpose of delivering that unique functional expertise to everyday consumers. Management believes 5.11's large and growing community of everyday consumers associate with the 5.11 brand heritage and authenticity and values 5.11's high-quality product design and functionality.
Headquartered in Irvine, California, 5.11 operates sales offices and distribution centers globally. 5.11 products are widely distributed in uniform stores, military exchanges, outdoor retail stores, its own retail stores and through e-commerce channels, including 511tactical.com.
History of 5.11
5.11's heritage dates back to the 1970’s when 5.11 pants were originally designed by Royal Robbins for elite rock climbers. These climbers wanted durable yet flexible and comfortable pants as they scaled the most extreme rock walls in Yosemite National Park. In the early 1990’s, the same 5.11 pant was adopted by the F.B.I. National Academy and became standard training issue because of its superior design and performance. Trusted by law enforcement and military professionals ever since, 5.11's innovative products have formed the cornerstone of the brand. 5.11 is an outfitter of choice for our heroes who require rugged, functional, durable, and technically-advanced products capable of withstanding harsh conditions without sacrificing comfort. Consumers’ needs and aspirations fuel 5.11's product innovation engine. 5.11 leveraged this foundation to expand their product expertise to a significantly larger market of underserved lifestyle-oriented consumers who identify with 5.11's brand positioning, appreciate their superior designs and share the "Always Be Ready" ("ABR") mindset. 
We acquired a majority interest in 5.11 on August 31, 2016.
Industry
5.11 participates in the global professional and consumer soft goods market for tactical gear and apparel; the addressable global soft goods market was estimated by management to be approximately $79 billion. 5.11 products are designed for use in a wide variety of activities, from professional to recreational and outdoor and indoor, and can be used all year long. As a result, the markets and consumers 5.11 serves are broad and deep. 
Products, Customers and Distribution
Products
Product innovation is at the core of 5.11’s heritage and identity. Since its inception, 5.11 has continuously developed and introduced innovative apparel, footwear and gear that are highly functional, technically-advanced and expertly designed setting the industry standard in each product category. 5.11’s product portfolio consists of technical apparel, footwear and gear designed with patented materials and functional features to their customers from head-to-toe. 5.11’s purpose-built products are durable, functional and comfortable. 5.11 serves a community of consumers inspired to live a life bigger than themselves and aligned with the “Always Be Ready” mindset. 5.11 offers a portfolio of head-to-toe purpose-built gear with patented functional features for both professional and recreational use. 5.11 focuses their product offering across three categories: apparel, footwear and gear. Leveraging in-field testing and design feedback from professional collaborations and in-house design and engineering expertise, 5.11 is able to create high quality products in each of its core segments. Innovating around the material and functional needs of professionals, 5.11 then broadens the application of their technical functionality into a range of consumer products within each category. This evolution of 5.11’s product lines creates tremendous leverage for their purpose-built functionality, allowing 5.11 to benefit from their growing and broad crossover appeal. 5.11’s innovations have not been limited to just apparel and textiles, as 5.11 has also proven their abilities within their footwear and gear categories. 
Apparel - Apparel represents 5.11’s largest product category at 66%, 65% and 67%, respectively, of net sales for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Within this category, 5.11 offers a broad assortment of men’s and women’s pants, shorts, shirts, outerwear, polos, and base layers. Apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort, durability, and utility. 5.11 has historically designed and developed innovative “families” of products around proprietary fabrics that 5.11 has created to meet the needs of its consumers. These product “families” typically start with a purpose-built pant and then expand into other products. 
•Pants - for many consumers, 5.11 technical purpose-built pants are the gateway into the 5.11 brand. 5.11 offers a wide range of pants to tackle any mission in a broad range of waist sizes and in seams for men and women. The fit, proprietary or patented fabrics and purpose-built designs deliver high levels of comfort, utility and durability. Among the most popular pants today are Stryke, Taclite, Apex, Fast-Tac and Defender-Flex, which have price ranges from $55.00 to $85.00. 5.11 offers five distinct pant lines, which anchor five different apparel families. The top selling pants include Taclite, which is built with a lighter and stronger fabric to outperform 5.11's original canvas pant, Stryke, which uses our patented FlexTac fabric, Apex, which leverages 5.11's Flex-Tac technology, and 5.11's highly durable FastTac all with stain and water-resistant properties, and Defender-Flex, 5.11’s performance denim.
•Shirts, T-shirts and Polos – 5.11 tops are feature rich just like their pants. Patented document pockets, pen pockets, venting for heat, stain resistant, easy care and snag resistance are among some of these key features. Many of the shirts fabrics are lighter versions of 5.11’s patented or proprietary fabrics used in their best-selling pants. Taclite shirts $55.00 to $60.00, Stryke shirts $75.00 to $80.00 and Fast-Tac $45.00 to $50.00 are among this product category as examples. These shirts can be used as uniforms and/or casual wear. 5.11's polos are also well known for their comfort, durability and utility. 5.11 offers them in a range of proprietary fabrics that are highly fade resistant, and among some of the most popular styles are Performance Polo, Professional Polo and Utility Polo, which have price ranges from $30.00 to $45.00.

Outerwear used on the job offer features not commonly found in lifestyle outerwear such as blood borne pathogen resistance or large areas of reflective materials. Technical system jackets, hard and soft shell as well as fleece pieces are designed to work individually or as a system. Features include innovations such as quick access side zippers and conceal pockets. 5.11 also offers technical survival outerwear systems engineered specifically for missions in extreme conditions. Products include base layers and briefs, pullovers, softshell jackets, wind pants, rain pants and jackets made of advanced fabrics. 
Gear - Gear represented 24%, 25% and 23%, respectively, of 2021, 2020 and 2019 net sales, which includes multi-use backpacks, cases, load-bearing equipment, range bags, duffels, field knives, watches and gloves. 5.11 bags, pouches, and packs provide reliable, multifunctional storage options designed to excel in a wide range of operational and recreational settings. The bag offering meets the critical needs of emergency medical, public safety, and military professionals in the field, outdoor adventure enthusiasts going off the grid, and anyone who needs to maximize space and convenience packing for a weekend getaway.

Allowing users to have different sets per mission specific needs and attached pouches in 8 directions vs just up or down like the other systems. 5.11 also offers a wide assortment of complementary accessories including belts, hats, flashlights, gloves, watches, knives and patches.
Footwear - Footwear represented 10% of net revenue in each of the years ending 2021, 2020 and 2019 and includes a full line of functional boots, low-profile tactical shoes, trainers, and socks. First embraced by 5.11 professional customers through their field boots, 5.11 has developed and tested footwear that stands up to extreme temperatures and weather conditions. 5.11 has evolved into the current lineup of trainers, casual sneakers and oxfords that afford 5.11's consumers the same level of comfort, protection, durability and style they expect from 5.11. 5.11 trainers feature All Terrain Load Assistance System (A.T.L.A.S.) technology, which is built to help 5.11's consumers undergo the most strenuous of workouts. The 5.11 A/T Trainer adds comfort and substantially increased agility, flexibility, and durability to cross training, functional fitness and heavy workouts. 
Customers and Distribution Channels
Management believes the brand’s empowering message, innovative product quality, and technically advanced designs appeal to a broad and growing consumer base. Based on the cross-over appeal of its products, 5.11 consumers fall into two core groups, professional “Prosumers” and “Everyday Consumers.” The 5.11 community was initially built by Prosumers, which consists of groups such as U.S. military personnel, law enforcement, first responders, and frontline workers, who require unwavering durability and reliability, but also value the design and comfort of the 5.11 products, providing the versatility to wear its products both on and off duty. Over time, 5.11 has expanded its reach into functionally focused Everyday Consumers, who, management believes, are inspired by Prosumers to live a life bigger than themselves and share the always be ready "ABR" mindset. 5.11 products resonate with a diverse group of Prosumers and Consumers, laying the foundation for continued expansion of a loyal and engaged consumer base into the future.
•Everyday Consumers: A blend of active, challenge-seeking and achievement-oriented gear consumers who thrive on fitness and adventure. Inspired by 5.11’s Prosumers to live a life bigger than themselves with the “Always Be Ready” mindset, these Everyday Consumers engage in a range of activities from fitness and training, to outdoor experiences such as hunting, hiking and overlanding, and purchase 5.11 products for everyday casual use. They prioritize maintaining high performance and, we believe, recognize that the functional superiority of 5.11 products aligns with their own achievement-oriented goals. They also appreciate the aesthetic and functional design of 5.11 products, which can take them from the comfort of their home to a favorite nearby hike, as well as 5.11 apparel, footwear and gear, which are as dynamic as they are. We believe the Everyday Consumers align with 5.11 products’ price points and superior value proposition.
•Prosumers: Includes everyone from the most elite U.S. military and law enforcement special forces units on the planet to everyday heroes including first responders, frontline workers, and other professionals, both on duty in mission-critical situations and off-duty. Prosumers are devoted to service, on and off-the-clock, and 5.11 endeavors to match their dedication and commitment as it produces superior technical products for every aspect of their lives. 5.11’s unique combination of durability, functional excellence, and comfort allows Prosumers to turn to 5.11 seamlessly across a variety of use-cases, whether on-duty, training, spending a weekend overlanding, backpacking, or camping. Many of the Prosumers are never fully off-duty, making the ability to serve them comfortably and reliably in all aspects of their lives a top priority. 5.11 enables them to “Always Be Ready” to meet any challenges that cross their path.
The strength of the 5.11 business model is the ability to serve the consumer however they prefer to engage while simultaneously reinforcing the 5.11 brand’s premium association and authenticity. Rather than taking the traditional channel approach to the business which management believes limits 5.11's potential, 5.11 enters a trade area with the right mix of owned stores, Consumer Wholesale, Professional Wholesale, eCommerce and marketplaces. By approaching trade areas in this manner, 5.11 shares inventory between stores and eCommerce and optimizes speed and efficiency with logistics that meet consumers’ needs wherever they prefer to shop, rather than directing them into a particular channel. This principle of product accessibility and experiential shopping drives brand building 
and organic lead generation. Though each channel is able to function profitability on an individual basis, the value derived from these channels working in concert is a unique competitive strength 5.11 employs in every market in which it operates.
Direct to Consumer - 5.11’s DTC channel is comprised of its digital platform, 511tactical.com, its growing network of retail stores as well as its third-party marketplace partners. 5.11 has significantly expanded its DTC mix in the past five years, with DTC now comprising 43%, 39% and 32% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 5.11’s website has grown significantly and drives a significant portion of its online sales. 5.11 also operates 87 company owned retail stores in 27 states, with plans to grow its footprint further. Both the online and company owned retail stores enable 5.11 to maintain direct relationships with consumers, influence the brand experience and better understand shopping preferences and behavior. 
•eCommerce. 5.11 has grown its ecommerce substantially in the last few years, which has been enabled by continued investment in digital infrastructure capabilities, enhanced consumer experience through increased customization and curation, and a growing global supply chain. Since 2017, 5.11 has invested over $35 million in capabilities to further its eCommerce infrastructure, including a scalable, ERP system and new locations that enable more cost effective and timely delivery for its eCommerce orders. 
•Retail. Since 2011, 5.11 has grown to 87 branded and owned retail locations around the U.S. as of December 31, 2021. Its locations provide an opportunity for 5.11 to showcase its diverse product assortment. Retail also provides an opportunity to further engage with consumers through the ABR mindset, with in-person, local community events and educational opportunities that elevate the experiential retail experience.
•Third-party marketplaces. 5.11’s third-party marketplace partners, such as Amazon, are invaluable tools for its omnichannel presence. The collaboration with the some of the largest retailers brings 5.11 increased opportunity from sales and revenue to increased marketing opportunities and brand awareness. Yet at the same time, 5.11 is strategic about protecting its 5.11 brand and delivering a consistent consumer experience in the third-party marketplace.
Wholesale - The Wholesale channel is comprised of Professional Wholesale, Consumer Wholesale and International business. Wholesale sales were 57%, 61% and 68% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Professional Wholesale channel specializes in demand creation for formal procurement through specification of 5.11 on government contracts around the world. The Consumer Wholesale channel is comprised of dealers, outdoor specialty retailers, and military exchanges, serving predominantly Everyday Consumers. The International business includes retail locations and International eCommerce sites. International products are currently distributed in over 120 countries across the globe, but management believes there is significant opportunity for continued International expansion. 
•Professional Wholesale. The Professional Wholesale channel consists of Prosumer sales relationships, and is comprised of dealers and resellers of 5.11 technical apparel, footwear and gear through governmental departments and agencies, including their retail front and eCommerce services that cater to Prosumers that need additional services, such as tailoring of their uniforms, in a one-stop-shop experience. Requirements of outfitting entire agencies or departments necessitates carrying numerous, often infrequently used, sizes and colors of a given product. In addition, 5.11’s years of handling these types of customized orders has resulted in 5.11 having a dedicated team with specialized expertise, a skillset that is unique in the industry. We believe 5.11’s significant investment in inventory provides a competitive advantage versus smaller less well capitalized competitors that carry low levels of inventory. 
•Consumer Wholesale. The Consumer Wholesale channel consists of Everyday Consumer sales relationships, and is comprised of third-party retailers and their eCommerce sites. 5.11 consumers can find its products at well-known big box sports, outdoor specialty retailers and military exchanges, in addition to third-party online only retailers who focus on product sales in similar apparel, footwear and gear categories as we do. Shop-in-shop concepts at key retailers who also attract the 5.11 customer base gives consumers a tactile experience with 5.11 products, by which they can feel, try on, and compare 5.11 product offerings. Additionally, 5.11 gains online traction from discussion boards and forums that bring professional and everyday enthusiasts together to discuss 5.11 products and the category in general. Both avenues serve as catalysts to attract new customers and keep long time consumers loyal to the 5.11 brand. 
•International. In addition to domestic whitespace, management believes there is opportunity to expand internationally as International only represented 18% of net sales in 2021. While 5.11 products are currently distributed in 120 countries across the globe, 5.11 has limited penetration in many of these countries with limited distribution in certain countries and certain dealers only carrying select styles. As such, management 
believes there is significant opportunity for continued international expansion and plan to expand in EMEA, Mexico, Asia, Australia, and Canada, and will leverage third-party logistics facilities in Europe and China as well as 5.11’s owned warehouse in Australia to drive this. 5.11 sees additional opportunities to further expand internationally and plan to methodically continue the expansion of its business.
No individual customer represented greater than 10% of 5.11’s net revenues in 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 5.11 had approximately $40.7 million and $21.8 million, respectively, in firm backlog.
Market Opportunities
5.11 products are designed for use in a wide variety of activities, from professional to recreational and outdoor and indoor, and can be used all year long. As a result, the markets and consumers 5.11 serves are broad and deep. The market opportunity is both significant and supported by the demand of 5.11’s innovative products providing an opportunity for future, profitable growth. As a category-defining brand, management believes its innovative products serving Everyday Consumers and Prosumers will continue to expand its addressable market. 
•U.S. Everyday Consumer Opportunity. 5.11 products address a large and broad Everyday Consumer base consisting of individuals from all walks of life. Everyday Consumers include small business owners, teachers, lawyers, farmers, homemakers and others, who enjoy wearing 5.11 during work, after work and on their weekend adventures. Management believes the Everyday Consumers are multi-generational, though skewing younger. These younger consumers are representative of an expanding, technically-focused consumer base looking for performance in every aspect of their daily lives. 5.11 caters to Everyday Consumers across all regions of the U.S., though management believes Everyday Consumers are located primarily in urban and suburban locations. 
•U.S. Prosumer Opportunity. 5.11’s premium product offering addresses a large Prosumer base, including first responders, military personnel, on and off-duty public servants, non-active military and other functionally focused professionals such as contractors, utility workers, hospital professionals and others using 5.11 for professional applications. Management believes Prosumers are multi-generational, though primarily middle-aged males. Similar to our Everyday Consumers, 5.11 caters to Prosumers across all regions of the U.S. and believes Prosumers are located primarily in urban and rural locations. The Prosumer market is a stable, recurring source of demand for our products. Management believes that Prosumer demand is resilient through economic cycles as Prosumers continue to depend on 5.11 products regardless of the economic environment. 
•International Opportunity. In addition to the domestic whitespace opportunity, management believes there is opportunity to expand to a large global market, as International only represented 18% of net sales in 2021. 5.11 products are currently distributed in 120 countries across the globe with our market entry point being the Professional Wholesale Channel. Most countries outside the US are under-penetrated with limited distribution and select dealers only carrying a portion of available styles. As such, management believes there is significant opportunity for continued international expansion and plan to expand in EMEA, Mexico, Asia, Australia, and Canada. 5.11’s approach will be to build out each region uniquely based on the size of the opportunity and the complexity of conducting business in a particular country. This approach currently utilizes a mixture of Professional and Consumer wholesale channels, distributors, wholesale partner stores, third party ecommerce sites as well as owned ecommerce websites and retail stores. To build this business 5.11 plans to leverage its third-party logistics facilities in Europe and China as well as its owned warehouses in Australia and the US for supply chain logistics. 5.11 sees additional opportunities to further expand internationally and plan to methodically continue the expansion of its business.
Business Strategies
Increase Brand Awareness and Grow the Passionate 5.11 Community - 5.11 has proven the profitability of its core product offerings and broad geographic relevance, while demonstrating clear brand authenticity and versatility. Though 5.11 is a brand and industry leader in the tactical and functional fitness communities, management believes it still has substantial room to grow through continuing to broaden its brand awareness. 5.11 has a large, growing community of deeply loyal consumers who share an authentic connection to the brand. 5.11 brand awareness is driven largely by its authentic association with public safety and the military, who rely on 5.11 gear for performance both on-duty and off-duty. To increase brand awareness, 5.11 designs and executes a variety of dynamic, high impact marketing strategies to engage existing consumers and reach new consumers, both domestically in the U.S. and internationally. 
5.11’s innovative brand and marketing strategy has been able to deliver significant brand awareness growth with relatively low marketing spend to date. The reason this has been so successful is due to the outsized returns from 5.11’s positive, community-driven word-of-mouth, stemming from consumers who share an emotional connection to 5.11. While 5.11’s marketing competencies extend well beyond traditional and digital media; 5.11 is a leader in content development and influencer marketing. 5.11 has built a community with major brand ambassadors and brand partners. 5.11 also partners with other leading brands across categories, such as Spartan in fitness and Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon in gaming. These strategic partnerships reinforce 5.11’s authentic and premium branding while simultaneously engaging a broad and passionate customer base of potential 5.11 consumers. Through its deep relationships, history of mutually beneficial partnerships, community, and social events such as “ABR Academies,” as well as its recognized leadership position, management believes 5.11 has become a partner of choice for influencers worldwide, leading to a significant competitive advantage. These marketing efforts deliver authentic, aspirational experiences and exclusive content that drive loyalty and engagement. 5.11 pairs this emotional brand marketing with sophisticated, data-driven performance marketing to further drive profitable customer acquisition, retention and high lifetime value. Through investment in these marketing strategies, 5.11 intends to drive passionate 5.11 connections within its community. 
Continued Execution of Integrated Omnichannel Platform to Drive Disciplined Growth - Management believes 5.11 has built a solid omnichannel distribution strategy, comprised of a rapidly growing DTC channel, which includes its owned retail locations, proprietary website, and third-party marketplace partners like Amazon, and a recurring Wholesale channel, which encompasses our Professional Wholesale, Consumer Wholesale, and International business. Rather than taking the traditional channel approach to the business which management believes limits 5.11's potential, 5.11 enters trade areas with a tailored DTC and wholesale strategy for that market. To best serve its consumers’ needs and to profitably accelerate growth, 5.11 continues to make investments in its omnichannel distribution strategy. To increase connectivity and reach a larger quantum of consumers, 5.11 is accelerating digital growth through the utilization of data analytics, targeted digital tactics and integrated marketing campaigns. In parallel, 5.11 continues to improve its website functionality as measured through strong site traffic, conversion and average order value. 5.11’s digital growth is complemented by the potential to expand its retail footprint. Currently, 5.11 has 87 physical stores, which represents an increase of 83 since 2015. Ultimately, the expansion of both channels presents an accessible near-term opportunity to accelerate growth and better serve evolving consumer preferences. 
Leverage Innovation Capabilities to Continue Developing New Products - At its core, 5.11 is an innovator that prides itself on making purpose-built technical apparel, footwear and gear for all of life’s most demanding missions. Throughout its history, 5.11 developed a diverse product portfolio that has helped grow its brand to be an industry leader in both its Wholesale and DTC businesses. Through its product innovation, 5.11 developed brand affinity, built on the foundation of its strong professional business. By serving its Prosumer, 5.11 increased demand in its Everyday Consumer segment, creating a large whitespace for growth. Moving forward, 5.11 is looking to grow share of its consumers’ wardrobe with a continued focus on everyday and weekend wear. In order to accelerate growth and meet consumer preferences, 5.11 plans to continue its consumer product innovation and expand its lifestyle product offering and other ancillary categories. 5.11 built a foundation of infrastructure and processes that allows it to have shorter lead time on product and design. 5.11 will continue to refine this in order to accelerate growth and take market share in the consumer business through an expanded product portfolio. Management believes that continued product innovation for 5.11's Prosumers drives brand loyalty with its Everyday Consumers. 5.11’s efforts to tailor products for its Prosumers drives innovation and credibility, which in turn yields superior functionality and appeal to Everyday Consumers. As 5.11 continues to scale, its broader consumer base allows it to reinvest resources back into its technical and functional expertise, further driving continued innovation for its professional consumers. 
Disciplined International Expansion - International represents 18% of net sales in 2021 and management believes 5.11 has a large opportunity to expand this business. Management believes Prosumers internationally view U.S. first responders, military and public servants as being among the best in the world, and want the same apparel, footwear and gear that they use both on and off duty. 5.11’s international strategy parallels the success it has enjoyed in the US by seeding the market through the Prosumer channels, which creates brand awareness and Everyday Consumer demand. 
Currently 5.11 products are distributed in over 120 countries across the globe. 5.11 leverages its proven playbook to invest in the largest, most successful international regions to grow its business. This strategy starts with the Professional Wholesale channel which establishes a profitable recurring revenue stream. As that grows, 5.11 builds a Consumer Wholesale channel and finally a DTC business is established in the most mature markets. While the 
strategic approach is consistent, each region is uniquely built based on the size of the opportunity and the complexity of conducting business in a particular country. Management believes there is a significant opportunity to continue 5.11's international expansion with a focus on EMEA, Mexico, Asia, Australia and Canada. 5.11’s ability to supply the same superior apparel, footwear and equipment to global markets allows it to expand its already profitable international business to Everyday Consumers living by the ABR mindset around the world.
Competitive Strengths
Authentic Global Lifestyle Brand with Passionate Following - Since inception, 5.11 has been a trusted brand by military, law enforcement, public safety, first responders and frontline workers and other service professionals around the world. No matter the mission or how demanding the environment, management believes 5.11 makes the apparel, footwear and gear of choice for professionals both on and off duty. This loyalty and trust, proven over decades from when the FBI Academy first adopted 5.11 pants in 1992, is a powerful tool. This stamp of approval from the elite professional community creates a brand halo effect that propels the Everyday Consumer business, allowing 5.11 to appeal to a broad range of consumers who embrace an active lifestyle, and who also appreciate 5.11 products’ superior technical performance for everyday use. 
5.11’s loyal consumers act as brand advocates, proudly wearing branded 5.11 gear and displaying 5.11 banners, decals and patches. Management believes that 5.11's brand advocacy through social media or by word-of-mouth, coupled with its varied marketing efforts, has extended its appeal to the broader community. As 5.11 has expanded its product lines, and broadened its marketing messaging, it has cultivated an increasingly diverse audience of both men and women living throughout the United States and, increasingly, in international markets. Management believes 5.11's loyal customers, alongside its heritage of authenticity and high-quality product performance create such a strong connection to the 5.11 brand. 
Deep Knowledge of Our Consumers Drives Our Product Development and Marketing - Management believe much of the 5.11 brand success is accredited to the loyalty of 5.11's consumers. 5.11 continuously strives to understand their evolving needs. Utilizing consumer insights through proprietary research, data, and analytics, 5.11 informs its product design and development teams to meet the demands and expectations of its loyal consumers. Having innovated closely with its Prosumers since 2003, 5.11 has a deep understanding and appreciation for the tactical issues they deal with daily. Seeing itself as problem-solvers first-and-foremost, 5.11 designs products that provide solutions to the obstacles they encounter while on duty, enhancing the daily regimens of its professional end-users. 5.11 consumers are passionate about their work and activities, and 5.11 matches that passion as it continuously strives to build functional, durable, and comfortable products. Not only is this insight helpful in product design and development, but also in outbound marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally. 5.11 supports and builds its brand through a fully integrated, high-impact marketing strategy which includes innovative and exclusive content, digital and social media, dedicated weekly Podcast, community-outreach, television and movie product placement and integrations, sponsorships, and local store activations and events that foster consumer engagement. 
Purpose-Built, Innovation-Led and High-Quality Product Offering - 5.11’s DNA is readiness. 5.11 addresses the needs of elite professionals around the world, outfitting them with the top-quality gear and equipment necessary to complete their missions. From this powerful foundation, 5.11 develops products to both address the specific needs of these professionals and have broad appeal. The process for development starts with a rigorous analysis of the most important functional qualities for 5.11 Prosumers. 5.11 then engages with the broader community, along with industry and trade professionals, to help find specific voids in the market worth targeting. 5.11 uses this data and insights to develop head-to-toe assortments to serve its consumers holistically whether they are at the office, exercising, experiencing the outdoors, or simply embracing the ABR lifestyle in their daily lives. 
5.11 delivers a comprehensive lineup that enables its customer to enjoy high-quality functionality without having to sacrifice lifestyle, comfort, or style. Management believes 5.11's ability to deliver this balance is a deep competitive advantage that is unrivaled and where most of its competitors have proven to be unsuccessful. 
Integrated Omnichannel Distribution Strategy - The foundation of 5.11's business model is to continue to strengthen its ability to serve the Everyday Consumer and Prosumer however they prefer to engage and purchase with 5.11, while simultaneously reinforcing 5.11's brand’s association and authenticity. Rather than taking the traditional channel approach to the business which management believes limits 5.11's potential, 5.11 enters trade areas with a tailored DTC and wholesale strategy for that market. By approaching trade areas in this manner, we believe 5.11 is able to share inventory between our stores and eCommerce, which allowed for 29% of eCommerce orders to be fulfilled out of store locations in late 2020, following the implementation of 5.11's Buy Online Ship From 
Store functions. This optimizes speed and efficiency with logistics that truly meet 5.11's Prosumers’ and Everyday Consumers’ needs wherever they prefer to shop, rather than directing them into a particular channel. We believe this principle of product accessibility and adopting to consumers’ shopping choices drives brand building and organic lead generation. Though each channel is able to function profitability on an individual basis, the value 5.11 derives from its channels working in concert is a competitive strength.
Scalable Infrastructure and High-Performance Team to Support Growth - 5.11 has invested approximately $70 million in capital expenditures in the last five years to not only improve operating and fulfillment performance in its current growth phase, but also as a foundation to support continued future growth. 5.11’s investment has included implementing a variety of strategic and operational improvements, including hiring experienced senior executives, expanding its company owned retail stores, executing merchandising improvements, enhancing distribution and supply chain capabilities and implementing data-driven digital marketing campaigns. 5.11’s current infrastructure allows it to fulfill orders accurately and effectively across all channels, including making certain shipments direct from the source to bypass distribution centers, while still providing buffer capacity capabilities to support future expansion. 
Competition
5.11 competes in the global marketplace for purpose-built technical apparel, footwear and gear. Management believes 5.11 has competitive advantages through its global omnichannel business model, which is comprised of a rapidly growing DTC channel and recurring Wholesale channel. 5.11 competes against activewear, outdoor and specialty apparel brands such as Nike, Under Armour, The North Face, Patagonia, Lululemon, Arc’teryx, Carhartt, Propper and Fecheimer Brothers. 5.11 competes with footwear brands such as Timberland, Bates and Danner, and with gear and bag brands such as Camelbak, Osprey and YETI. 5.11 also competes with specialty retailers such as REI, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Galls.
Suppliers
5.11 has built a supply chain that is optimized for its business, through which 5.11 controls the design, development and fulfillment of its products. 
Sourcing and Manufacturing 
5.11 does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead, it chooses to contract with third-party suppliers for materials (fabric and trims) and manufacturers for finished goods. 5.11 partners with high-quality vendors and retains complete control of all intellectual property associated with its products. 5.11 product design, technical design and development teams work directly with its vendors to incorporate innovative materials that meet the high-quality product standards demanded by its customers. 5.11’s primary product specifications include characteristics like durability, protection, functionality, and comfort. 5.11 collaborates with leading fabric suppliers to develop fabrics that it ultimately trademarks for brand recognition whenever possible. 
The materials used in 5.11 products are developed in partnership between its material vendors and its design, product development and sourcing teams, then sourced by its manufacturers from a limited number of pre-approved suppliers. To enhance efficiency and profitability, 5.11 recently adopted 3D design capabilities for virtual prototyping allowing it to make better and quicker decisions prior to creating physical prototypes. Additionally, 5.11 recently partnered with one of our apparel manufacturers to create a development center with dedicated resources to facilitate rapid prototyping. 
All 5.11 products are manufactured by third-parties. 5.11 works with a group of 60+ vendors, 15 of which produced approximately 80% of its products in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 44% of 5.11 products at cost were produced in Bangladesh, approximately 36% in Vietnam, and the remainder in China, Cambodia, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Africa, Central America and the United States. 5.11 does not have any long-term agreements requiring it to use any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce its products in the long term. 5.11 purchases from suppliers on a purchase order basis informed by capacity forecasts. 5.11 measures supplier performance through various performance indicators and partner closely with them to continually improve efficiency, cost, and quality. Management believes that 5.11's principal manufacturers have the additional capacity to accommodate future growth. 
As a company devoted to the needs of public safety and mission-oriented professionals, 5.11 has developed secure relationships with a number of its vendors and take great care to ensure that they share its commitment to quality 
and ethics. Under its supplier agreements, suppliers must follow 5.11’s established product design specifications and quality assurance programs to meet specified standards. To ensure vendor reliability and quality, 5.11 has established a sourcing office in Hong Kong, which employs approximately 59 individuals whose primary functions include vendor management, commercialization, product development, production planning, vendor compliance, and quality assurance. 
5.11 requires its vendors to comply with its Vendor Code of Conduct relating to working conditions as well as certain environmental, employment and sourcing practices. 5.11 requires all vendors to contractually commit to upholding these standards. Additionally, in alignment with its values, 5.11 encourages its manufacturers to be certified through the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) program, which is an independent organization dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing. Once a vendor is part of 5.11’s production network, its in-house production team work together with third-party inspectors to closely monitor each partner’s compliance with applicable laws and standards on an ongoing basis. 
5.11 regularly sources new suppliers and manufacturers to support its ongoing growth and carefully evaluates all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share its standards for quality and integrity. To mitigate supplier concentration risk, 5.11 commercializes its top key items at multiple factories to ensure it can balance geographic risks as well as respond quickly to spikes in business. 5.11 also continuously seeks out additional suppliers and manufacturers to enable contingency plans that minimize disruptions, as well as support its future growth. 
Distribution
5.11 leases and operates a distribution facility in Manteca, California to support its fulfillment needs across the Americas (North, Central & South). Additionally, 5.11 operates a small distribution facility in New South Wales, Australia to serve the Australia and New Zealand markets. 5.11 utilizes global third-party logistics providers to fulfill customer orders in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, which are located in Sweden and China, respectively. These third-party logistics providers manage all various distribution activities in their regional markets, including product receiving, storing, limited product inspection activities, and outbound shipping. 
Intellectual Property 
To establish and protect its proprietary rights, 5.11 relies on a combination of trademark (including trade dress), patent, design, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions in license agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contracts. 5.11’s intellectual property is an important component of its business, and management believes that 5.11's know-how and continuing innovation are important to developing and maintaining its competitive position. Management also believes having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable on 5.11's products is an important factor in continuing to build its brand and distinguish its products. 5.11 considers the 5.11 name and logo trademarks, together with 58 issued and pending patents and 374 registered trademarks, both in the United States and internationally, to be among its most valuable intellectual property assets. 
Regulatory Environment
In the United States and the other jurisdictions in which 5.11 operates, it is subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of fulfillment centers and privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, in the United States, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR") in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, the U.K. GDPR and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018 in the United Kingdom, and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law in Brazil, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementing and supplementing laws in the European Economic Area. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 5.11 products sold outside of the United States may be subject to tariffs, treaties and various trade agreements, as well as laws affecting the importation of consumer goods. 5.11 monitors changes in these laws and management believes that 5.11 is in material compliance with applicable laws. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. A portion of sales generated by its International business is derived from sales to foreign government agencies, and management believes 5.11 is in material compliance with related applicable laws. 
Human Capital
Mission-Driven, Innovative and Supportive Culture – From the beginning, 5.11’s company culture has always been focused on serving those who serve—military, law enforcement officers, public safety and first responders and frontline workers from around the world. The passion for serving these top professionals inspires 5.11 to extend serving its consumers into their everyday lives, to be prepared for whatever life throws their way. 5.11’s teams embrace its ABR mindset, and its core values allow 5.11 to attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to succeed and share the vision of becoming “an iconic global brand rooted in innovating purpose-built gear for the most demanding missions while inspiring the world to always be ready.” 
5.11’s work environment is open and collaborative, spanning a global organization from its headquarters in Irvine, CA and offices in Hong Kong, Mexico, Sweden and Australia, to its distribution center in Manteca, CA, and to its U.S. retail stores. Its employees around the world are 5.11’s most valuable and important brand ambassadors. Their commitment to 5.11 and its mission, and their knowledge and passion for 5.11 products allows 5.11 to execute its company strategy and strengthens its brand loyalty. Additionally, 5.11 store employees are critical to 5.11’s success and often represent members of its communities, with many of them retired military, law enforcement officers and first responders. 
5.11 prides itself in its ability to work directly with top professionals around the world, innovating to solve their greatest needs in the most mission-critical settings. 5.11 maintains a global footprint, with employees working in thirty-three states and eighteen countries. At December 31, 2021, 5.11 had 861 full-time employees and 185 part-time employees. 5.11 strives to create a welcoming and caring environment across the entire organization and celebrate the passion its team members bring forward in serving its consumers. 5.11 believes it has created a company culture focused on attracting, retaining, and developing talent, which enables it to exceed consumers’ expectations and meet its growth objectives. 5.11 prioritizes building a diverse, inclusive, equitable and supportive team that is driven by creativity and purposeful innovation.
BOA
Overview
BOA, creator of the revolutionary, award-winning, patented BOA Fit System, partners with market-leading brands to make the best gear even better. Delivering fit solutions purpose-built for performance, the BOA Fit System is featured in footwear across snow sports, cycling, hiking/trekking, golf, running, court sports, workwear as well as headwear and medical bracing. The system consists of three integral parts: a micro-adjustable dial, high-tensile lightweight laces, and low friction lace guides creating a superior alternative to laces, buckles, Velcro, and other traditional closure mechanisms. Each unique BOA configuration is engineered for fast, effortless, precision fit, and is backed by The BOA Lifetime Guarantee. BOA is headquartered in Denver, Colorado and has offices in Austria, Greater China, South Korea, and Japan.
History of BOA
BOA was founded in 2001 by Gary Hammerslag, a snowboarder, surfer, and entrepreneur. Gary moved to Steamboat, Colorado in the mid-90’s after successfully selling his previous company, which created innovative catheter solutions that improved angioplasty procedure speed and effectiveness. After arriving in Steamboat and frequently snowboarding, Gary envisioned a possibility to dramatically improve the fit and performance of snowboard boots by applying elements of his learnings in the medical device field. Gary developed a fit system as an alternative to traditional laces for snowboard boots and partnered with K2 and Vans to launch the first BOA-equipped snowboard boots to consumers in the winter of 2001. After a successful launch, BOA became widely adopted on snowboard boots. 
BOA’s next phase of growth was largely in the outdoor sporting and recreation markets. In 2005, BOA expanded its focus to hiking and trail-related footwear, followed by cycling and golf in 2006 and hunting and fishing in 2007, at which point BOA surpassed 1 million users worldwide. From 2008 to 2011, having gained credibility in consumer markets, BOA introduced products for the workwear footwear market as well as products for the medical bracing market. In 2013, the company entered the running and training footwear market. 
In 2019, BOA launched its state-of-the-art Performance Fit Lab ("PFL") to quantitatively measure the impact of BOA-equipped footwear on athletic performance. The PFL is used to advance performance footwear fit technology by testing, refining, and improving footwear products in collaboration with the company’s major brand partners and serves as a catalyst for innovation. In 2021, BOA surpassed 25 million users worldwide.
We purchased a majority interest in BOA on October 16, 2020.
Industry
BOA participates broadly in the global footwear market, representing approximately 10 billion pairs of shoes sold annually. BOA’s addressable market is identified based on product type, price lane, and geography. BOA targets the premium segment, where applicable price lanes tend to be at the upper end of each category. With respect to product type, the overall market is segmented into various subcategories, of which BOA primarily targets footwear for active performance sports, outdoor applications, and kids. Based on target footwear categories and applicable price lanes, management estimates BOA’s addressable market to be approximately 750 million pairs of shoes sold annually. Management estimates the company has approximately 3-4% share within its addressable market. 
Products, Customers and Distribution Channels
Products
The BOA Fit System consists of a durable lace, which is guided by low-friction guides and attached to a dial that is typically mounted on the footwear heel, tongue or eye-stay for micro-adjustability to enhance performance fit. BOA’s current product portfolio has four platforms, H, L, M, and S-Series, which vary in cost, weight, tension, and use case. Each dial design can be customized with over 220 colors allowing the product to fit cohesively with each brand partners’ specific designs and colorways.
All platforms share the distinctive characteristics that differentiate BOA from competing offerings: micro-adjustability to achieve the perfect fit, measurable performance benefits validated by the company’s testing lab, durability and quality proven in extensive field testing, a lifetime guarantee on the end-product’s dial and laces, and the distinctive BOA sound heard when turning the dial.
Each platform is designed and engineered to address the specific performance fit needs of the end user by use case. Factors such as size and shape of dial, level of torque, internal mechanics, and weight vary amongst platforms, and each platform is further segmented into product collections that differ in aesthetic, optimal placement on the shoe, and cost. Within each product collection, dial designs and materials differ to accommodate preferences of the end user and retail price points of the end product.
Customers and Distribution Channels
BOA has approximately 300 global brand partners, including leading footwear companies such as Adidas, Specialized, Shimano, Fizik, ASICS, Burton, La Sportiva, K2, Vans and FootJoy who feature BOA systems across a variety of sporting and professional industries including snow sports, cycling, outdoor, athletic, workwear and medical. BOA typically sells directly to the manufacturing partner responsible for final assembly of the brand partner’s product. BOA works with 470+ brand partner factories with limited revenue concentration. Most brand partner factories are located in Asia, primarily in China and Vietnam, and are in relatively close proximity to BOA’s supply chain. 
Rather than being solely an OEM part supplier, BOA maintains highly collaborative relationships with its brand partners to actively co-develop innovative, performance-driven footwear, helmets and bracing. BOA contributes substantial design and testing resources to ensure its system is used in a way that maximizes performance based on dial placement and configuration. The BOA system is not simply a “lace replacement” or plug and play option, but rather a solution that must be integrated into each product model through a 6-18 month development cycle to create a system that works specifically with a product’s unique structural design. This process allows BOA to ensure brand image consistency, end product quality and the best performance fit. 
Footwear, headwear, and medical bracing products featuring BOA systems are primarily sold through brick-and-mortar sporting goods retailers, specialty sport retailers, online retailers, or brand partners’ owned retail and online channels. According to management’s estimates, end consumption is geographically diverse, with approximately 15-20% of products consumed in North America, 30-35% in Europe, and 45-50% in Asia. 
No individual customer or brand partner factory represented greater than 8% of BOA’s net revenues in 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, BOA had approximately $31.7 million and $15.2 million in order backlog, respectively.
Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths
Business Strategies
Continued Share Growth in Established Categories - BOA has established a strong presence in certain core categories in Northern Europe, Korea, Japan, and the United States where BOA has proven efficacy and established strong brand partner relationships. In these core categories, BOA is focused on building a community to cross market to and is actively working to reimagine product solutions to deliver the best product to consumers. 
Going forward, BOA intends to leverage its brand partner relationships to expand penetration and capture additional share in growing markets such as workwear in North America and Asia, outdoor in markets outside of Korea, and golf in North America. BOA has developed region and category specific products to better cater to the individual dynamics of each market including products that deliver a better price/value proposition, new product configurations for region specific trends and performance fit messaging to increase consumer awareness and adoption. Through its reputation in the marketplace, athlete endorsements and deep relationships with leading brand partners, the company is focused on delivering the performance benefits of the BOA system across an expanding set of sporting categories and geographies.
Expand into Pioneering Categories - BOA has identified several adjacent segments including alpine skiing, trail running, and court sports such as tennis, badminton and basketball which management believes are well suited to benefit from the performance fit that BOA provides. BOA is actively working with leading brand partners to develop sport-specific footwear configurations that can benefit from the advantages of the BOA system. By leveraging BOA’s brand equity and proven solutions, the company believes there is significant whitespace to increase penetration in these early adoption segments.
Competitive Strengths
Culture of Innovation and New Product Development - Management believes that there is significant opportunity to continue advancing product offerings through its commitment to innovation. Product development and innovation are divided amongst (i) BOA’s internal innovation and evolution of its fit systems and platforms, refining and improving on the aesthetics, durability, user experience, and price/value, (ii) the design and engineering collaboration that BOA engages in with its brand partners for project and application-specific needs, and (iii) BOA’s advanced research through its PFL, which is transforming markets through innovative performance fit solutions that are scientifically tested and validated.
Deep Collaborative Partnerships – BOA has deep partnerships with the premier brands in every segment they compete within. They collaborate throughout the entire product lifecycle process, including product strategy, design and development, factory operational/service support, retail education, consumer warranty support, and marketing/demand creation. BOA has a high partner retention rate due to the depth and value of the relationships.
Premium Brand Position - BOA is focused on continuing to build awareness around its aspirational, global brand through content leadership, athlete endorsements, paid media, brand partner affiliations, and other business. BOA primarily increases awareness through direct-to-consumer marketing and co-marketing with its established brand partner relationships. In 2019, BOA launched its “Pioneer Program,” an athletic sponsorship platform. BOA leverages athlete endorsements to further establish its positioning as a performance fit leader as well as drive cross-segment brand awareness. The company recently launched its “Dialed in” Campaign, which showcases pioneers performing at their peak both physically and mentally. BOA also relies on its trusted brand partners to increase BOA brand awareness. The company focuses its efforts on collaborating with brand partners who are innovative market leaders that meet BOA’s brand standards and align with BOA’s positioning as a high-performance, premium brand. 
Technology Leader with Robust Patent Portfolio – BOA is a leader in performance fit innovation and has built a diverse global portfolio of issued and pending utility and design patents, creating barriers to entry. Throughout BOA’s history, the company has continually innovated on dial attributes including quick release, durability, manufacturing ease, and micro adjustability, in addition to integrated lace and lace guide designs and configurations critical to imparting precision fit and reduced friction. BOA’s engineering and technical expertise enables the development and production of performance fit solutions, allowing their brand partners to offer performance enhancing technology and product differentiation. 
Competition
BOA’s competition can be segmented into three categories: established footwear brands that maintain their own proprietary technology for particular market segments, lower-quality subscale BOA imitators, and non-mechanical lace alternatives (bungies, buckles, plastic lace locks, Velcro, and webbing). Management estimates that BOA is 20+ times the size of its next closest direct competitor.
Research and Development
BOA’s approach to new product development is a multi-stage, cross-functional process. For each new product introduction, BOA works closely with brand partners to identify or develop the best suited BOA solution, its optimal placement on the shoe (or other application), color and design specifications, and cost targets. On existing products, BOA is committed to continuous innovation, including key improvements such as lower installation costs for brand partner factories, thinner and sleeker product profiles for improved aesthetics, in field warranty rate reduction to 0.5%, improved user experience, and the broadening of the platform suite to address key opportunities in alpine skiing, basketball, and outdoor. 
As part of BOA’s innovation strategy around improving fit, the company has invested in a state-of-the-art PFL to quantitatively measure the impact of the BOA system on end products. In partnership with the University of Denver, the PFL is testing a significant number of products to evaluate a) Agility & Speed, b) Power & Precision, and c) Endurance & Health. By addressing these global performance attributes rather than segment-by-segment specific needs, PFL findings will be relevant and applicable across BOA’s product lines. The results of these studies help further validate BOA’s value proposition, strengthening the company’s position as a fit and performance leader. Moreover, the PFL serves as a platform to test and refine new product offerings ahead of launch.
Suppliers
BOA maintains a longstanding deep relationship with a sole supplier for plastic injected parts (dial units and lace guides), representing approximately 70% of total purchases. The vendor is based in China with multiple facilities. Furthermore, the vendor has supplied the company since 2001 and has continuously invested in its tools and infrastructure to maintain quality standards and keep up with demand. BOA owns all its injection molds. Lastly, the vendor is also a minority shareholder in BOA and is committed to supporting its growth. The remainder of BOA’s purchases are for steel and steel coated lace, textile laces and guides, monofilament lace and webbing, which are sourced from China, Korea, Europe, and the U.S. Management believes its manufacturing partners have sufficient capacity to accommodate future growth.
Intellectual Property
BOA has built a diverse global portfolio of 233 issued and pending utility and design patents. The company has created 37 patent “families” with intellectual property covering its core technology (dials, guides, laces), as well as strategic configurations and component installation methods. BOA maintains 10 Trademarks in 40+ countries.
Seasonality
Due to the diversity of sporting segments BOA participates in, there is no significant seasonality to the business, though BOA typically has higher sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher cycling and golf sales in preparation for the spring retail season, as well as higher sales in the second quarter each year due to purchasing trends in the snow sports product group.
Environmental, Social and Governance
As a forward-looking company, BOA is working towards making a sustainable impact throughout the world, minimizing their imprint on the environment, and diversifying the Outdoor and STEM industries. BOA has set bold goals to dramatically reduce the use of virgin fossil fuel-based plastics, overall manufacturing waste, and materially increase use of sustainable energy. The company has already made progress in all three areas and will be formally distributing its environmental and community impact report in the second quarter of 2022. In the last year, BOA has increased their budget and invested in three new roles to focus on these efforts. The company has formed partnerships with organizations in every region that are focused on providing more access and opportunities to under-represented populations and protecting the environment. Through these programs, BOA is working to create purposeful connections to their employees, partners, and consumers – bringing their mission, values, and products to the hearts and minds of their audience.
Human Capital
BOA strives to be an inclusive global team that trusts and cares for each other, their partners, the community, and the environment. Since their launch in Steamboat, CO in 2001, BOA has maintained a strong and healthy company culture that is rooted in a passion for the outdoors and the various industries that encompass their product offering. As the team has expanded over the last 20 years, BOA has placed an emphasis on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace with the goal of representing their global communities. BOA employees are located in four countries and the United States. As of December 31, 2021, BOA had 241 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. 131 employees are located in the United States and 114 work outside of the United States in Austria, Greater China, Japan, and South Korea. 
BOA is focused on both attracting new talent and growing talent from within the organization - providing learning and development opportunities, placing an emphasis on independent career plans, and building a team of leaders, managers, and staff that represents their mission, vision, and values. BOA maintains a high retention rate of their employees and believes the company's relationship with its employees is connected and transparent.
Ergobaby
Overview
Ergobaby is dedicated to building a global community of confident parents with smart, ergonomic solutions that enable and encourage bonding between parents and babies. Ergobaby offers a broad range of award-winning baby carriers, blankets and swaddlers, nursing pillows, strollers, and related products that fit into families’ daily lives seamlessly, comfortably and safely.  Ergobaby is headquartered in Torrance, California.
History of Ergobaby
Ergobaby was founded in 2003 by Karin Frost, who designed her first baby carrier following the birth of her son. The baby carrier product line has since expanded into 3-position and 4-position carriers, with multiple style variations. In its second year of operations, Ergobaby sold 10,500 baby carriers and today sells over 1 million a year. In order to support the rapid growth, in 2007, Ergobaby made a strategic decision to establish an operating subsidiary (“EBEU”) in Hamburg, Germany. 
In 2014, Ergobaby launched the Ergobaby Four-Position 360 Baby Carrier which expanded on Ergobaby’s leadership in the baby carrier category by offering an ergonomic, outward forward facing position for the baby and comfort for the parent. The Ergobaby 360 Carrier won the 2014 JPMA Innovation award in the baby carrier category. In 2016, Ergobaby launched the 3-Position Adapt Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and offers some unique parent comfort features including lumbar support and crossable shoulder straps, as well as the benefit of being an all-in-one carrier with no need for an infant insert accessory (for babies 7-12lbs.). Also in 2016, Ergobaby acquired membership interests of New Baby Tula LLC (“Baby Tula”). Baby Tula designs, markets and distributes premium baby carriers and accessories and focuses its efforts on both the ergonomics and fashion of its products. In 2017, Ergobaby launched the All Position, All-in-One Omni 360 Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and includes all of Ergobaby’s parent & baby comfort features from the 360 and Adapt Baby Carriers, as well as the same consumer benefit of no infant insert accessory needed. 
In 2018, Ergobaby entered into the stroller category with 2 new models. The first product launched was a full-size option called the 180 Reversible Stroller. This was followed later in the year by a premium compact option, the Metro Compact City Stroller. In 2019, Ergobaby launched the Embrace Baby Carrier which is geared for newborns (7lbs-25lbs) and merges the coziness of a soft wrap carrier with the simplicity and comfort of a structured carrier. In 2020, Ergobaby launched Everlove, a first of its kind carrier buyback, restoration, and resell program to extend the lifecycle of our carriers for a more sustainable future. In 2021, Ergobaby launched the multiple award winning Aerloom, the first-of-its-kind, FORMAKNIT™ baby carrier made to move, stretch and fit parents' daily life. This carrier has a seamless knit design and 87% of the knit is made with recycled plastic bottles. 
We purchased a majority interest in Ergobaby on September 16, 2010.
Industry
Ergobaby competes in the large and expanding infant and juvenile products industry. The industry exhibits little seasonality and is somewhat insulated from overall economic trends, as parents view spending on children as largely non-discretionary in nature. Consequently, parents spend consistently on their children, particularly on 
durable items, such as car seats, strollers, baby carriers, and related items that are viewed as necessities. Further, an emotional component is often a factor in parents’ purchasing decisions, as parents’ desire to purchase the best and safest products for their children. On average, households spent between 11 - 27% of their before-tax income on a child. Similar patterns are seen in other countries around the world.
Demand drivers fueling the growing spending on infant and juvenile products include favorable demographic trends, such as (i) a high percentage of first time births; (ii) an increasing age of first time mothers and a large percentage of working mothers with increased disposable income; and (iii) an increasing percentage of single child households and two-family households.
In purchases of baby durables, parents often seek well-known and trusted brands that offer a sense of comfort regarding a product’s reliability and safety. As a result, brand name, comfort and safety certifications can serve as a barrier to entry for competition in the market, as well as allow well-known brands such as Ergobaby and Baby Tula to compete in a growing premium segment.
Products, Customers and Distribution Channels
Products
Baby Carriers - Ergobaby has two main baby carrier product lines: baby carriers and related carrier accessories, sold under both the Ergobaby and Tula brands. Ergobaby’s baby carrier designs support a natural, ergonomic ("M" shaped) sitting position for babies, eliminating compression of the spine and hips that can be caused by unsupported suspension. The baby carrier also distributes the baby’s weight evenly between parents’ hips and shoulders and alleviates physical stress for the parent. Both Ergobaby’s 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers have been recognized by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute as being “hip healthy”. Additional accessories are provided to complement the baby carriers including the popular Infant Insert.
Within the Ergobaby Baby Carrier product line, Ergo sells 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers in a variety of style and color variations and Baby Tula sells 3-Position and 4-Position fashion-oriented baby carriers. Baby Carrier sales represented approximately 90%, 89% and 88%, of net sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Within the baby carrier accessories category, the Infant Insert is the largest sales component of the accessory category but has seen declining sales as customer move to newborn ready carriers. Accessory sales represented approximately 3.2% in 2021, 5.4% in 2020 and 6.1% in 2019, of net sales.
Ergobaby’s core Baby Carrier product offerings with average retail prices are summarized below:
Ergo
•9 styles of baby carriers - $80 - $220
•2 styles of Infant Inserts - $35 
Tula 
•8 styles of baby carriers - $79 - $1,000
•1 style of Infant Inserts - $20
Customers and Distribution Channels
Ergobaby primarily sells its products through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers and distributors. In Europe, Ergobaby products are sold through its German based subsidiary, which services brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers in Germany and France; it’s United Kingdom based subsidiary; and its Tula subsidiary in Poland; as well as a network of distributors located in Sweden, Norway, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Russia and the Ukraine. Customers in Canada are predominately serviced by Ergobaby’s Canadian subsidiary. Sales to customers outside of the U.S., Canadian and European markets are predominantly serviced through distributors granted rights, though not necessarily exclusive, to sell within a specific geographic region.
Ergobaby had approximately $14.3 million and $11.5 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Two individual customers accounted for approximately 25% of Ergobaby's gross sales in 2021 and 2020. No other single customer represented more than 10% of Ergobaby’s gross sales in 2021 or 2020.
Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths
Business Strategies
Increase Penetration of Current U.S. Distribution Channels - Ergobaby continues to benefit from steady expansion of the market for wearable baby carriers and related accessories in the U.S. and internationally. Going forward, Ergobaby will continue to leverage and expand the awareness of its outstanding brands (both Ergobaby and Baby Tula) in order to capture additional market share in the U.S., as parents increasingly recognize the enhanced mobility, convenience, and the ability to remain close to the child that all Ergobaby carriers enable. Ergobaby currently markets its products to consumers in the U.S. through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers, and directly through Ergobaby.com and Babytula.com websites. 
International Market Expansion - Testimony to the global strength of its lifestyle brand, Ergobaby has historically derived approximately 60% of its sales from international markets. Like it has in the U.S., Ergobaby can continue to leverage the Ergo and Tula brand equity in the international markets it currently serves to aggressively drive future growth, as well as expand its international presence into new regions. The market for Ergobaby’s products abroad continues to grow rapidly, in part due to the fact that in many parts of Europe and Asia, the concept of baby wearing is a culturally entrenched form of infant and child transport.
New Product Development - Management believes Ergobaby has an opportunity to leverage its unique, authentic lifestyle brands and expand its product line. Since its founding in 2003, Ergobaby has successfully introduced new carrier products to maintain innovation, uniqueness, and freshness within its baby carrier and travel system product lines and has become the baby carrier industry leader with the Omni 360 baby carrier. In addition to expanding into new product carriers like swaddling and nursing pillows, in 2018, Ergobaby entered the stroller category by introducing a new premium compact stroller (Metro Compact City Stroller) and a full-size stroller (180 Reversible Stroller).
Competitive Strengths
Ergobaby innovation - Ergobaby Carriers are known for their unsurpassed comfort. Ergobaby’s superior design results in improved comfort for both parent and baby. Parents are comfortable because baby’s weight is evenly distributed between the hips and shoulders while baby sits ergonomically in a natural ("M" shaped) sitting position. The concept of baby carrying has increased in popularity in the U.S. as parents recognize the emotional and functional benefits of carrying their baby. Consumers continually cite the comfort, design, and convenient “hands free” mobility the Ergobaby carrier offers as key purchasing criteria. Ergobaby is also recognized as an industry leader in innovation. With the launch of the Ergo 4-Position 360 Carrier in 2014, the launch of the 3-Position ADAPT carrier in 2016, the launch of the All Position Omni 360 carrier in 2017, the launch of the Embrace carrier in 2019, and the launch of the Aerloom carrier in 2021. Ergobaby continues to innovate in the baby carrier segment on a regular basis.
Baby Tula Community - Tula enjoys an active and enthusiastic community who are vocal advocates for the brand. The Tula community acts as both an avid source of feedback on new product launches, which influence future product and patterns, as well as brand influencers to the broader new parenting community.
Competition
The infant and juvenile products market is fragmented, with a few larger manufacturers and marketers with portfolios of brands and a multitude of smaller, private companies with relatively targeted product offerings.
Within the infant and juvenile products market, Ergobaby’s baby carriers primarily compete with companies that market wearable baby carriers. Within the wearable baby carrier market, several distinct segments exist, including (i) slings and wraps; (ii) soft-structured baby carriers; and (iii) hard frame baby carriers.
The primary global competitors in this segment are BabyBjorn, Infantino, and Chicco. In geographies globally, Ergobaby also competes with companies that have developed wearable carriers, such as Infantino, Manduca, Cybex, Nuna, Stokke, Boppy, and Pognae. Within the soft-structured baby carrier segment, Ergobaby benefits from strong distribution, good word of mouth, and the functionality of the design.
Suppliers
During 2021, Ergobaby sourced its Ergo carrier and carrier accessory products from Vietnam and India, and manufactured its stroller systems and accessory products in China. Baby Tula products predominantly were produced from factories in India and Poland and were also produced in its own facility located in Poland. In 2009, Ergobaby partnered with a manufacturer located in India, and in 2012, Ergobaby began sourcing carriers and accessories from a manufacturing facility in Vietnam. More than 50% of Ergobaby’s carriers and accessories came from Vietnam in 2021. Baby Tula sourced its carrier, accessories and blanket products from Poland, Vietnam and India, with purchases from these locations accounted for approximately 14% of total Ergobaby purchases. Management believes its manufacturing partners have the additional capacity to accommodate Ergobaby’s projected growth.
Intellectual Property
Ergobaby maintains and defends a U.S. and international patent portfolio on some of its various products, including its 3-position and 4-position carriers.  Currently, it has 81 patents (including allowances) and 33 patents pending in the U.S. and other countries. Ergobaby also depends on brand name recognition and premium product offering to differentiate itself from competition.
Human Capital
Ergobaby is a global organization headquartered in Torrance, California, with offices in Hamburg, London, Paris and Bialystok, and distribution and retail partnerships in more than 75 countries. As of December 31, 2021, Ergobaby had 183 employees globally. Ergobaby’s people are its most valuable asset and the organization is proud to be recognized as one of LA’s Best Places to Work 2021. Ergobaby strives to create a culture of trust with diversity of thought to drive innovation, create products and be a resource that helps to empower families everywhere. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, and unique capabilities of Ergobaby employees is evident in its positive culture and highly recognized brand. The company’s corporate responsibility and diversity and inclusion efforts are employee led, driven by the belief that supporting a global society that is resilient, empathetic, anti-racist, and inclusive starts with having a community where all people can thrive, starting from within the company itself.
Lugano
Overview
Lugano is a leading designer, manufacturer, and retailer of high-end jewelry. Lugano utilizes an extensive network of suppliers to procure high-quality diamonds and rare gemstones. Often taking inspiration directly from the stone, Lugano designs and creates one-of-a-kind jewelry that it sells to a broad base of clients. Lugano conducts sales via its own retail salons as well as pop-up showrooms at Lugano-hosted or sponsored events in partnership with influential organizations in the equestrian, art, and philanthropic communities. Lugano is headquartered in Newport Beach, California.
History of Lugano 
Lugano was founded in 2004 by husband-and-wife team Moti and Idit Ferder. The company’s chosen name, “Lugano” was inspired by the picturesque Lake Lugano of southern Switzerland, a one-of-a-kind “gemstone of nature” surrounded by the Lugano Prealps mountains. 
Lugano opened its first retail salon in 2005 in Newport Beach, California as an appointment only showroom. This salon, located in Orange County’s high-end Fashion Island shopping district, grew rapidly, and served as a critical proof of concept for the Lugano’s bespoke retail strategy. In the subsequent years, Lugano opened three more retail salons with its trademark high-touch sales approach to expand the Lugano’s geographic footprint in key destinations frequented by its target clientele. 
In 2008, Lugano started an equestrian division focused on the Southeastern United States to complement its retail sales strategy. Today, Lugano sponsors many key equestrian events and is a long-standing supporter of equestrian-related causes. 
Throughout its history, Lugano has also focused on building strong relationships with influential social and philanthropic organizations in the local communities surrounding its retail salons. In Aspen, Colorado Lugano frequently hosts private dinners and events in collaboration with organizations like the Aspen Institute or the Aspen 
Museum of Art. Lugano’s event-based marketing strategy enables Lugano to regularly meet prospective clients and reconnect with repeat clients.
In 2020, Lugano expanded its production capabilities by building an in-house workshop to provide increased production efficiencies and improve control over its high-end gemstone inventory. Today, Lugano’s unique go-to-market strategy, one-of-a-kind designs, vertical integration and carefully cultivated network of clientele serve as critical differentiators among the retailer’s competitors in the high-end jewelry market.
We purchased a majority interest in Lugano on September 3, 2021.
Sales and Distribution 
Products
Lugano designs, manufactures, and retails high-end jewelry including unique rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets and brooches that range in price from under $1,000 to well over seven figures, with an average price of approximately $115,000 per piece. Lugano’s designers start with a rare stone as inspiration and craft jewelry that highlights the beauty and perceived value of the stone. As a result, Lugano’s pieces are often seen as one-of-a-kind works of art, creating a highly desirable niche in the broader jewelry marketplace. Competitors’ products are typically high volume or collection-based jewelry lines that are inherently less unique or exclusive – traits highly valued by Lugano’s clientele. 
Customers
Lugano’s client base generally consists of sophisticated, high-net-worth individuals who value long-standing relationships and a personalized sales approach over one-time purchases and the high-pressure sales tactics used by other jewelry competitors. A typical Lugano client is community and relationship-driven and seeks unique products with emotional significance. The purchasers or recipients of Lugano pieces are predominantly women and often leaders in their respective communities. Lugano’s clients can range in age from 25 to over 80 and come from all over the nation, with most based in California, followed by Florida, New York, Texas, and Colorado, reflecting the company’s current retail salon footprint, along with limited international clientele. 
Lugano’s retail revenue is diversified with no customer representing greater than 10% of total revenue in 2021. Management also believes its client relationships are significantly stickier than those of other jewelry retailers. Lugano enjoys a growing percentage of repeat business year-over-year, with repeat customers contributing an increasing percentage of revenue. Beyond its retail business, Lugano also sells loose diamonds via its wholesale division representing approximately 12% of Lugano’s revenue in 2021. 
Distribution
Lugano goes to market via four retail salons in Newport Beach, CA, Palm Beach, FL, Aspen, CO and Ocala, FL, all strategically located in wealthy regions near popular vacation and up-scale shopping destinations frequented by Lugano’s target clientele. In a salon, Lugano aims for an elegant and private ambience to facilitate its high-touch sales approach. Salons are carefully laid out, enabling Lugano to host private dinners, parties, or other social events. Unlike other jewelers that highlight their jewelry with long, rectangular counters that separate the customer from the salesperson, Lugano decorates its salons with curved tables and couches designed to facilitate comfort, relationship-building, and ease of conversation. Lugano also markets and sells jewelry via pop-up showrooms at Lugano-hosted or sponsored events or in the homes of its clients. 
Market Trends, Business Strategies and Competition 
Market Trends
Lugano competes broadly in the personal luxury goods market, a portion of the overall global luxury market. According to Bain & Company, after years of consistent growth, the personal luxury goods market experienced a brief contraction in 2020. However, since then, the personal luxury goods market grew by 29% to hit $320 billion, increasing the size of the market by 1% versus 2019 levels. Bain & Company estimates that the personal luxury goods market could reach $408-$430 billion by 2025 with a sustained growth of 6-8% annually. 
Lugano currently has very low penetration (<1%) within its target market of high-net-worth individuals. Lugano’s addressable client base has been steadily increasing for over a decade and increased by nearly 10% in 2019 to an estimated 290,000 individuals worldwide, mirroring the growth seen in their combined net worth, which increased to 
over $35 trillion. As a result, management believes there is significant runway for additional growth by expanding brand awareness and household penetration.
Business Strategies
Lugano believes it is well-positioned to emerge as a leading domestic and international luxury brand. Lugano’s key growth opportunities include expanding its geographic footprint across target markets, domestically and internationally, growing the number of events it hosts, and branching into activities beyond equestrian sports that similarly attract wealthy participants. 
Competition
The luxury jewelry market is highly fragmented with the leading six to seven companies accounting for approximately 20% of the market. LVMH, with brands like Tiffany, Bvlgari and Chaumet; Richemont with brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels; Graff Diamonds; and Harry Winston lead the market. These competitors often utilize a traditional retail model focused on foot traffic and tourism, are typically collection-based, and do not exclusively focus on the high-end segment of the jewelry market. The remaining portion of the market consists of national retail brands and small or midsize players that operate regionally or in an online-only format. 
Competitive Strengths
Sourcing, Design and Production Capabilities
A deep network of international vendors enables the company to source rare and difficult-to-find stones. These stones are then combined with the world-class capabilities of Lugano designers who create sought-after masterpieces that cater to the company’s target clientele. Lugano’s in-house production workshop or close network of captive workshops provide increased production efficiencies, improved control over its inventory and better speed to market.
High-touch Retail Model
Lugano’s one-of-a-kind inventory requires a unique and high-touch sales strategy which the company has cultivated over its nearly 20-year history. The company’s retail experience is carefully curated, emphasizing both exclusivity and elegance, both critical to the sale of Lugano jewelry. 
Event-based Marketing Strategy
Lugano sponsors over one hundred events each year, enabling the company to meet prospective clients and reconnect with existing clients that have become loyal and repeat purchasers. In each market that Lugano enters, management takes great care to establish itself as part of the local community and become a focal point for its clients’ lifestyles and activities. Through its efforts, Lugano invests in relationships which build brand value and customer loyalty. Lugano-sponsored events are often a client’s gateway into the Lugano community (management estimates over 60% of clients are initially contacted at Lugano-sponsored events). Once a part of the Lugano community, customers tend to view jewelry purchases from Lugano as recurring events and often increase the size of their purchase from their previous transaction. 
Sourcing and Availability of Materials 
Lugano sources diamonds and precious gemstones from a variety of vendors and wholesalers. Generally, Lugano sources polished diamonds and gemstones that are crafted into a Lugano-designed piece. From time to time, Lugano also opportunistically acquires finished jewelry with a high resale value from its global network of vendors. Most of Lugano’s diamonds are sourced from domestic wholesalers. By not purchasing raw stones directly from mines, Lugano limits conflict diamond exposure. Lugano ensures all its diamond vendors adhere to the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme to prevent conflict diamonds from entering its supply chain.
Lugano’s vendor base is diversified with no vendor making up more than 10% of total purchases and the top 10 vendors making up less than 50% of all purchases. Lugano maintains decade-long and trusted relationships with its top vendors. 
Seasonality
While individual retail salons experience some seasonality (e.g., winter in Aspen, summer in Newport Beach), these patterns offset one another at the company-level. Additionally, due to the variety of events Lugano hosts all-year-round, there is no significant seasonality in the business. 
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2021, Lugano employed a non-union labor force of 54 full-time employees. 25 employees work in sales and marketing, 12 work in design & production, 9 work in operations, 4 work in accounting and 4 work in corporate. Lugano intends to continue to grow its headcount and build out its middle management as it executes on its growth strategy of new salon openings, increased event-based marketing, and international expansion. Management believes Lugano's relationship with its employees is good.
Marucci Sports
Overview
Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Marucci is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium wood and metal baseball bats, fielding gloves, batting gloves, bags, protective gear, sunglasses, on and off-field apparel, and other baseball and softball equipment used by professional and amateur athletes. Marucci also develops and licenses franchises for sports training facilities. Marucci products are available through owned websites, their team sales organization, Big Box Retailers, and third-party e-commerce and resellers. In 2017, Marucci acquired Victus Sports, a King of Prussia, Pennsylvania based complementary baseball equipment manufacturer and distributor. Marucci has vertically integrated wood bat manufacturing and has built long-standing relationships with international suppliers who manufacture the remainder of their product lines.
Marucci is an established brand commanding strong market share across product categories. Marucci’s mission is to “honor the game” and brands itself as such with simplistic imagery and to-the-point marketing campaigns.
Victus is a more recent entrant to the baseball equipment market but garners similar wood bat usage as Marucci. The brand is widely recognized for its edgy designs and big attitude. Victus’ mission, in contrast to Marucci’s, is to embrace the evolution of the game and to salute the next generation of players who set out to change it.
History of Marucci Sports
Marucci Sports was founded in 2009 by a team including two former professional baseball players. Marucci released its first metal bat, the Marucci CAT5, in 2009. In 2013, Marucci released batting gloves and launched its first series of fielding gloves, the Founders’ Series. Marucci was able to leverage its brand power to expand into the baseball apparel and accessories market as well. In 2018, Marucci acquired Carpenter Trade to expand the quality and technology of its fielding glove offering and change the current consumer expectations for a truly customized fielding glove. Victus’ product offering expanded into metal bats in 2019 with the launch of its Vandal line and recently expanded with the launch of the NOX. In 2019 Marucci also acquired two timber mills and a wood drying facility, securing vertical manufacturing capabilities within its wood bat product category and ensuring access to the best wood in the game. In 2021, Marucci acquired Lizard Skins, a designer and seller of branded grip products, protective equipment, bags and apparel for use in baseball, cycling, hockey, Esports and lacrosse. Marucci believes that the acquisition of Lizard Skins will allow it to build on its leading position in diamond sports while simultaneously developing the company’s presence in new sports markets such as hockey and cycling.
Today, Marucci is a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium Marucci and Victus-branded baseball and softball equipment including wood and metal baseball bats, fielding gloves, batting gloves, bags, protective gear, sunglasses, on and off-field apparel, and other baseball and softball equipment. All of these products are sold around the world in retail stores, online and through its corporate owned and franchised training facilities.
We acquired a majority interest in Marucci on April 20, 2020.
Industry
Marucci Sports primarily competes primarily in the domestic baseball equipment market which includes wood bats, metal bats, fielding gloves, cleats, protective and other gear, and uniforms/ team apparel of which management estimates constitutes approximately $1.3 billion of annual retail revenue. Marucci Sports also competes within the greater global baseball equipment market which management estimates constitutes approximately $2.2 billion of 
annual retail revenue. Marucci’s product offering targets primarily the premium equipment price point more often used in competitive club and travel leagues, for which participation rates are generally more stable.
The industry is generally considered to be a stable sector with growth rates in the low single digits. Baseball equipment is largely sold through national retailers. Independent resellers and online platforms also sell baseball equipment while the balance is purchased directly from the manufacturer.
Products, Customers and Distribution Channels
Products
Marucci designs, manufactures, and markets six categories of products: (i) metal bats, (ii) wood bats, (iii) apparel & accessories, (iv) batting gloves, (v) fielding gloves, and (vi) bags & protective equipment. Marucci’s product strategy encompasses producing high quality products recognized by consumers for their performance, craftsmanship, and value, and building on a rich history to introduce innovative new products. 
Metal Bats - Metal bats have historically represented Marucci’s largest product category by revenue. The metal bats are priced at the premium end of the market, with average retail prices ranging from $219.99 to $549.99. Marucci produces metal bats for all ages, from college to tee ball, with a focus on elite high school players. The CAT series is the flagship metal bat product from Marucci. Marucci also offers a lower price point model, the F5. Victus’ first metal offering, the Vandal, was first launched in 2019, and is priced similarly to the CAT series. Victus later introduced its first two-piece bat in the NOX. Metal bats used in youth and elite travel leagues are subject to strict regulations limiting spring and exit velocity. The company has historically followed a two-year product release cycle, and Marucci metal bats have notable staying power with their customer base as prior year models remain in production. 
Wood Bats - Marucci’s wood bats are built with quality, precision, and customization. Marucci prides itself in making every pro-bound bat a “game bat”. Marucci offers two types of wood bats: ash and maple. Ash is a soft, open grain wood. Maple bats are a much harder, closed grain wood and constitute a large majority of the company’s wood bat sales. The wide variety of selection and price points offer professional-level quality and cuts to amateur players as well. Innovative customization options further drive engagement. 
Fielding Gloves - Marucci offers a growing set of fielding gloves across eight product series: Capitol, Cypress, Ascension, Oxbow, Acadia, Caddo, Magnolia (softball), and Palmetto (softball). Marucci has a complete line of gloves to meet the needs of every position player at every age and skill level. Marucci offers gloves across the pricing spectrum. Marucci acquired Carpenter Trade in 2018, along with their C-Mod technology which provides a unique fit. The C-Mod technology uses a size-specific, ergonomically shaped fit system that creates a more form fitting hand stall for greater control, leverage and responsiveness when fielding. The tailored-fit technology is available in straight or shift.
Apparel & Accessories - Marucci offers a full suite of apparel and accessory offerings that is rapidly expanding. The current product portfolio includes on-field and off-field apparel, sunglasses, hats, grips, and more. Most sales of these products are sold direct-to-team in custom apparel packages including baseball pants, jerseys, practice shirts, and more. Marucci has in-house screen-printing operations allowing for customization of various pieces of apparel. The acquisition of Lizard Skins in October 2021 further enhanced the company’s accessory offering. Lizard Skins is the top manufacturer and marketer of grips used in baseball, cycling, hockey, lacrosse, gaming, and various other sports.
Batting Gloves - All Marucci batting gloves are designed to meet professional standards of comfort, durability and performance while also appealing to users of all levels. Marucci has four lines of batting gloves: Pittards’ Reserve, Signature, Quest, and Code while Victus has one, the Debut. Marucci also offers limited production customized batting gloves. Marucci’s batting gloves span the pricing spectrum. 
Bags & Protective Gear - Marucci offers an extensive line of bags and protective gear including bat packs, bat quivers, helmets, shin and elbow guards, catchers gear, and more allowing Marucci to cater to nearly all its customers playing needs.
Customers and Distribution Channels
Marucci sells its products through several channels including Big Box Retailers; Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC"), Direct-to-Team ("DTT"), the company's experiential Clubhouse retail stores and other Owned Channels; and third-party e-
commerce and resellers. Marucci’s top 5 customers accounted for 57.7% of 2021 of net sales.
Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths 
Business Strategies
Continued Innovation in Existing Product Categories - Marucci plans to continue to build on its successful history of bringing new, innovative, highly anticipated products to market through leveraging its stringent new product development process, and external and internal manufacturing capabilities. The company has near-term new product launches and existing product updates planned across all categories that will further drive innovation, strengthening our competitive positioning.
Further Penetration of Existing Customer Accounts - Marucci has identified opportunities to leverage its existing relationships with retailers to drive expanded SKU offerings across categories, especially in apparel. Additionally, management believes the company can continue to improve Victus product adoption with existing channel partners. 
An approximately $150 million fielding glove market represents a significant growth opportunity for Marucci. Fielding gloves are the second largest hard goods market in baseball / softball. Marucci plans to leverage its brand strength and innovation to capture share in this high margin category. The acquisition of Carpenter Trade in 2018 has allowed Marucci to offer a highly customized glove that serves as a key differentiator in fielding gloves.
Victus Category and Product Expansion - Victus has strong penetration in the majors and key affiliations with top players. The brand released its first metal bat in 2019, the one-piece Victus Vandal BBCOR bat and later launched its first two-piece bat, the NOX. Metal bats sales are expected to meaningfully contribute to Victus’ overall sales in the future. Victus’ key affiliates and player advocacy has driven a halo effect across other categories. Growth in lifestyle and fan apparel represents a significant opportunity for Victus to leverage its brand. 
Lizard Skin Expansion – With the acquisition of Lizard Skins in October 2021, Marucci plans to expand its distribution of the company’s key grip product which are used in various sports including baseball, softball, cycling hockey and lacrosse. Additionally, Marucci sees opportunity to expand its grip offering into gaming and other similar applications, as well as batting gloves. 
International Market Expansion - International sales currently represent a small portion of total sales. Natural expansion opportunities exist in baseball markets abroad such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, and Latin America. Marucci has achieved profitable growth in Asia by leveraging its premium brands and accessing markets through proven team dealers and distributors. In late 2021, Marucci launched a Japan-based sales office.
Further Penetration of Softball Market - Marucci’s plans to leverage its brand strength in baseball to further penetrate the softball market. Marucci is driving brand awareness and growth in the softball market from the ground up through grassroots marketing efforts, social media influencers, leveraging its partnerships with colleges and affiliated Marucci club teams, as well the recently launched softball mobile tour, to get in front of players of all ages. Marucci has dedicated employees who focus on softball expansion and have experience in the category as former collegiate athletes and coaches.
Expansion of the Direct-to-Team Sales Channel - The Direct-to-Team sales channel, launched in 2014, allows Marucci to sell its equipment and apparel directly to thousands of players. Marucci currently has 29 Founders’ Club organizations, representing 15,000 players. The Founders’ Club is an elite alliance of some of the nation’s premier amateur baseball programs selected by Marucci for their dedication to excellence on and off the field, reputation as a positive influence in their community, and commitment to growing their organization.
Marucci’s proprietary online platform for this channel, “Locker Room”, is ideal for any group that requires individual processing and purchasing. There is potential opportunity to leverage Locker Room capabilities across other team sports as the total market size for U.S. Team Sports Uniforms is approximately $1.3 billion. Marucci feels the DTT strategy is still in its early stages of growth.
Industry Consolidation - With a well-developed global supply chain, external and internal manufacturing capabilities, sophisticated management systems infrastructure, and extensive network of relevant relationships, Marucci is a platform for consolidation within both the baseball and softball equipment and apparel spaces. Management has identified a pipeline of potential acquisition targets that would help Marucci strengthen and expand its product offering and address new market segments. 
Competitive Strengths
Originally founded to focus on baseball and softball, Marucci has a unique strength with its authentic knowledge and experience of these sports. Whether leading the Company’s strategy, cutting and sanding wood bats, or shipping product, the Marucci team consists largely of former players or coaches of the game itself. This same strategy extends to any category or market the company participates in so that the product is truly designed by the player for the player.
Product Development – the product development cycle varies by product with bats taking approximately 16 months to reach distribution and batting gloves requiring approximately 9 months. New product development at Marucci occurs in six successive stages: (1) Identify Market Opportunity – search for player needs via internal leads, supplier partners, or on-the ground feedback from players in their network, (2) Cross Functional Ideation – host ongoing dialogue with sourcing partners to identify next-gen technology, (3) Product Development – have sourcing partners begin preliminary testing runs once viable new products are identified, (4) Production and Validation – continue rigorous prototyping and product validation on the field and in the Marucci performance lab where Big League and amateur players test and provide feedback, (5) Marketing – engage in-house marketing team to drive product naming, rollout, branding, and marketing stories to expand awareness, and (6) Product Rollout and Distribution – finalize the marketing story, conduct sales presentations, and provide samples to representatives and finally receiving orders from channel partners and beginning full production.
Leading Brands with Professional Halo – Both Marucci and Victus products are preferred by Big League players (#1 and #2 bat brands in the Big Leagues, respectively), and Lizard Skins is the grip tape of choice for many top athletes at both the professional and amateur levels. Marucci’s leading share of use among the top players at the top levels of baseball underlies the aspirational nature of the brand and creates a “halo effect” for its broader product lines, giving the brands credibility and permission to play in adjacent product categories, customer demographics, and geographic markets.
Vertical Integration – Marucci owns its own wood mills, giving the company greater control over the availability and quality of the supply of wood billets used to produce its wood bats. Marucci’s original value proposition to professional players was to guarantee that each bat delivered would meet the most stringent standards demanded for in-game use. As product tolerances continue to tighten and supply chain complexity creates operational challenges for many competitors, Marucci’s ability to ensure both product quality and availability is a unique competitive advantage.
Competition
Marucci competes with offerings from multiple large baseball equipment manufacturers, including Easton (under the Easton and Rawlings brands) and Wilson Sporting Goods Company (under the Wilson, DeMarini, Louisville Slugger, and Evoshield brands), and numerous smaller wood bat specific brands including Old Hickory, Chandler Bats, Tucci, Dove Tail, Sam Bat, and D-Bat. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty.
Suppliers
Marucci leverages a combination of sourcing and in-house manufacturing. Metal bats, apparel, batting gloves, fielding gloves, bags, and other accessories are sourced from an international network of primarily Asian manufacturing partners, while wood bats are manufactured domestically at the company’s Baton Rouge (Marucci) and King of Prussia (Victus) facilities. In 2019, the company acquired two timber mills, effectively consolidating its wood bat supply chain to improve quality and production efficiency and ensuring continued access to the best wood in the game.
Intellectual Property
Marucci maintains 47 trademarks in the U.S., 41 of which are registered and 6 of which are pending registration. Marucci also has 1 issued patent. Management considers its trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages.
Regulatory Environment
Baseball and softball equipment, outside of bats, enjoys a largely restriction free Federal/Local government regulatory framework. Metal bats used in youth and elite travel leagues are subject to strict regulations limiting 
spring and exit velocity determined by self-regulatory associations connected to the sport. There are three key regulatory groups associated with baseball: USA Baseball, United States Specialty Sports Association (“USSSA”), and Bat-Ball Coefficient of Restitution (“BBCOR”). Each have their own method for measuring bat performance. BBCOR is the standard currently governing adult baseball bats used in High School and Collegiate play while USA and USSSA govern youth leagues. There are also regulatory bodies specific to softball including Amateur Softball Association (ASA) and Independent Softball Association, among others. Wood bats used in professional baseball are subject to league-specific regulations. We believe all of our products adhere to established regulations
Seasonality
Marucci typically has higher sales in the first quarter each year, ahead of the primary baseball season. However, management expects seasonality to smooth as baseball becomes an increasingly year-round sport. 
Human Capital
Marucci had 322 employees at December 31, 2021, 256 full-time and 66 part-time employees, all located in the United States. Additionally, Marucci works with a third party Employer of Record in Japan to deploy its strategies in Asia and currently has 5 full-time employees. Marucci's labor force is non-union. Management believes that Marucci has a good relationship with its employees. 
Velocity Outdoor
Overview
Velocity Outdoor, headquartered in Bloomfield, New York, is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of airguns, archery products, laser aiming devices and related accessories. Velocity Outdoor offers its products under the highly recognizable Crosman, Benjamin, LaserMax, Ravin and CenterPoint brands that are available through national retail chains, mass merchants, dealer and distributor networks. Airguns historically represent Velocity Outdoor's largest product category. The airgun product category consists of air rifles, air pistols and a range of accessories including targets, holsters and cases. Velocity Outdoor's other primary product categories are archery, with products including CenterPoint crossbows and the Pioneer Airbow, consumables, which includes steel and plastic BBs, lead pellets and CO2 cartridges, lasers for firearms, and airsoft products. In September 2018, Velocity acquired Ravin Crossbows, a manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology.
We acquired a majority interest in Velocity Outdoor on June 2, 2017.
History of Velocity Outdoor
Velocity was founded in 1923 as Crosman Rifle Company and was one of the first manufacturers of recreational airguns in the United States. Velocity Outdoor acquired Visible Impact Target Company in 1991 and Benjamin Sheridan Corporation in 1992. Benjamin was, and continues to be, a dominant U.S. producer of high-end pneumatic and CO2 powered airguns while Sheridan was one of the world’s foremost manufacturers of high-quality paintball markers. In 2007, Velocity expanded its offerings outside the traditional airgun category with the debut of its new optics division, Centerpoint Precision Optics. In 2008, Velocity diversified further by adding Crosman Archery to its list of branded products and introduced two new hunting crossbows in addition to youth archery products. In 2016, Velocity debuted its Centerpoint line of crossbows and the Benjamin Pioneer Airbow, the first ever mass-produced air powered archery device and with the 2018 acquisition of Ravin Crossbows, Velocity expanded their archery product line into the higher-end segment of the crossbow market. 
Today, Velocity Outdoor is an international designer, manufacturer and marketer of Crosman and Benjamin airguns including related ammunition and accessories, archery products including the Ravin and Centerpoint crossbows, airsoft rifles, pistols, and ammunition, laser aiming devices, and precision optics.
Industry
Velocity Outdoor primarily competes within the airgun and archery sub-segments of the broader outdoor recreational products industry, which together management estimates constitute approximately $1.1 billion of annual manufacturer revenue. Both categories share certain common characteristics, including consumer demand for innovation, similar sales channels, and unique regulatory frameworks.
The airgun industry is estimated by management to constitute approximately $275 million of annual manufacturer revenue, including consumables and excluding accessories. With a history stretching back over a century, the industry is generally considered to be a mature sector, with stable growth rates in the low single digits. Airgun products are largely sold through big box specialty sporting goods retailers, mass merchants and online retailers, each accounting for roughly 22%, 21% and 26% of purchases, respectively. The remainder moves through Dealers and Distributors. Airguns are less seasonal than archery because there is no defined hunting season, although sales spike somewhat around holidays.
The archery equipment market is estimated by management to constitute approximately $770 million of annual manufacturers sales, of which $500-$550 million is attributable to bows and $200-$250 million is attributable to related archery consumables. Vertical and compound bows, and crossbows each comprise about half of the category sales, with crossbows gaining share in recent years. Independent archery Dealer’s account for 38% and big box specialty sporting goods retailers account for approximately 33% of consumer purchases. Distributors, mass merchants, and online retailers make up the remainder of consumer sales.
Products, Customers and Distribution Channels
Products
Velocity designs, manufacturers and markets five categories of products: (i) airguns, (ii) archery products, (iii) consumables, or pellets, BBs and CO2 cartridges, (iv) optics, and (v) airsoft. Velocity's product strategy encompasses producing high quality, feature-rich products recognized by consumers for their craftsmanship and value, and building on a rich history to introduce innovative new products.
Airguns - Airguns has historically represented Velocity's largest product category. The airgun product line consists of air rifles, air pistols and a range of accessories including targets, holsters and cases. Velocity's airguns are designed to be multi-purpose, multi-occasion products, for use in recreational plinking and target shooting, pest control, and hunting. Velocity offers a “good, better, best” array of airguns under the Crosman and Benjamin brands. The Crosman brand is known for high value at an accessible price, where the Benjamin brand is typically associated with premium products falling within the mid- to high-price point. Additionally, Velocity rounds out its offering with mid-level products produced under an exclusive licensing agreement with Remington for its Remington, Marlin, DPMS, and Bushmaster brands. 
Archery Products - Velocity re-entered the archery market in 2016 with a product line anchored by the Centerpoint crossbow and the first-of-its-kind Pioneer Airbow. Centerpoint has grown rapidly since it was launched to become the second largest player in the crossbow category. The Centerpoint Sniper 370 is the top-selling SKU in the crossbow market, with more than twice the volume of its nearest competitor. Centerpoint acquired market share by offering features like an aluminum frame, higher shooting velocity, integrated string stops, a 4x32mm scope and shoulder sling at very competitive retail prices.
Concurrent with the launch of the Centerpoint line of crossbows, Velocity also introduced the Pioneer Airbow. The Pioneer Airbow created a new sportsman category as the first ever mass-produced air-powered archery device, effectively bridging the gap between airguns and archery. Velocity acquired Ravin Crossbows in 2018, further expanding its product line in the archery market. Ravin Crossbows is a leading designer, manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology.
Consumables - Velocity's consumables segment consists of steel and plastic BBs, various styles of lead pellets, and single-use CO2 cartridges used to power airguns. BBs are typically used for plinking, training, or target shooting at a more affordable cost, while different pellet styles are designed either for accuracy, maximum penetration, or a combination of the two. Velocity is the world’s largest provider and only domestic manufacturer of CO2 cartridges, having first introduced the use of C02 as an airgun propellant in 1961. Consumables are produced under the Crosman, Benjamin, and Copperhead brand names. 
Optics - Launched in 2006, Velocity's line of optics products offers high-performance, value-priced optics under the Centerpoint brand. The scopes, sights, binoculars, lights, and lasers are marketed for traditional firearms, in addition to select airgun and crossbow offerings. In 2017, Velocity added to their optics product line with the acquisition of the commercial division of LaserMax. LaserMax is a global leader in hardened and miniaturized laser systems, offering a comprehensive line of premium laser sights for home defense, personal protection and training use. LaserMax’s commercial business provides laser sighting solutions and tactical lights to the firearm original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and retail channels. Management believes that the addition of the LaserMax products enables Velocity to reach a wider range of new customers across retail channels. 
Airsoft - Airsoft guns are a class of air, CO2, gas, or electric-powered guns that are typically made from high-impact plastics and are engineered with recreation in mind to fire safe, plastic BBs quickly and accurately. Airsoft products are most often used for recreational purposes by a younger demographic and a strong user base amongst military and law enforcement customers. Velocity offers a broad portfolio of airsoft rifles and pistols under its owned Crosman Elite and Game Face brands, as well as the licensed U.S. Marines brand. 
Distribution Channels
Velocity's products are sold through over 900 customers across a mix of sales channels, including mass merchants, national retailers, distributors/dealers/regional chains, international distributors, and e-commerce. Over the last 5 years, management has successfully diversified both its sales channel composition and customer mix.
Velocity sells its products through nearly all major domestic mass merchants and sporting goods retailers currently selling airguns and has established a strong e-commerce platform to allow for flexibility in a changing retail environment. The company has been selling to many of its customers for over 20 years, maintaining close relationships with key purchasing personnel through high-touch customer service. Velocity is one of the only players in the sportsman category offering category management services, product assortment, and SKU optimization feedback typical of larger multinational consumer products companies. This data-sharing has resulted in higher retailer sell-through and margin enhancement, more accurate sales forecasting, and a 98% fulfillment rate, all of which are key components in maintaining status as a vendor of choice. 
Velocity maintains an internal sales team responsible for covering the vast majority of its customer relationships, or approximately 90% of total sales. Furthermore, Velocity supplements its in-house team with four independent sales representative organizations, providing coverage for approximate 375 additional customers across their respective geographic territories. International sales efforts are handled by Velocity-employed account executives who work through local distributors in order to ensure that products conform to local regulatory standards. 
Customers
Velocity sells its products through nearly all major domestic mass merchants and sporting goods retailers and has established a strong e-commerce platform to allow for flexibility in a changing retail environment. The three largest customers represented 35.8% of gross sales in 2021 and represented the major sales channels; mass merchant, e-commerce, and regional retail.
Velocity had approximately $26.6 million and $39.0 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Business Strategies and Competitive Conditions
Business Strategies
Continued Innovation in Existing Product Categories - Velocity plans to continue to build on its successful history of bringing new, technically superior products to market through leveraging its stringent new product development process, internal manufacturing capabilities, and a flexible supply chain. The company has near-term new product launches and existing product updates planned across all categories, including the highlights below. 
•Airguns - Building on the Silencing Barrel Device (SBD) technology, Velocity is introducing a line of multi-shot break-barrel models that feature a 10-shot clip that advances automatically. Velocity is also enjoying success with its recent introduction of fast shooting full-auto BB guns under the Crosman brand. In addition, Velocity continues to be the world’s largest producer of BB, pellets and CO2 powerlets.
•Archery - Following the successful 2016 launch of the CenterPoint crossbow line, Velocity continues to offer the best value proposition in the industry. Recently CenterPoint has introduced new crossbow models at higher price points to segments of the market and Ravin continues to introduce models that lead the industry in innovation and performance. Ravin recently introduced its new electric cocking/de-cocking model that shoots at 500 feet per second. 
•Optics - In addition to the launch of three CenterPoint Spectrum First Focal Plane series of scopes, the company recently released CenterPoint optics to include range finding binoculars and scope adapters. Additionally, following the launch of the grip activated GripSense lasers in 2017, Lasermax has introduced a universal rail mounted laser featuring the same activation technology.
•Airsoft - Airsoft guns are a class of air, CO2, gas, or electric-powered guns that are typically made from high-impact plastics and are engineered with recreation in mind to fire safe, plastic BBs quickly and accurately. Airsoft products are most often used for recreational purposes by a younger demographic and a strong user base amongst military and law enforcement customers. Velocity offers a broad portfolio of airsoft rifles and pistols under its owned Game Face brand.
Expand into Adjacent Product Categories - Management believes that the company can leverage in-house manufacturing and sourcing partners to develop products in new categories that utilize Velocity's existing distribution network and brand strength. 
Further Penetration of Existing Customer Accounts - Management has identified several strategies for further penetrating its existing customer accounts. First, Velocity has identified opportunities to leverage its existing relationships with retailers to drive expanded SKU offerings across categories. Additionally, management believes the company can expand the CenterPoint brand into the dealer network due to the acquisition of Ravin. Furthermore, management believes that the company is well positioned to grow as its brick-and-mortar customers adapt to a changing retail landscape. Velocity believes it can leverage its structured analytical sales approach and new marketing initiatives to assist retailers with enhancing their online sales, similar to the strategies it already employs working with pure e-commerce customers like Amazon and Pyramyd Air.
Consolidation Platform - With a well-developed global supply chain, refined manufacturing capabilities, sophisticated management systems infrastructure, and extensive network of relevant relationships, Velocity sees itself as a platform for consolidation within both the broader outdoor recreational goods space and the archery space specifically. Management has identified a pipeline of potential acquisition targets that would help Velocity strengthen and expand its product offering and address new market segments. 
International Growth - Velocity is exploring opportunities to grow international sales and increase market share by pursuing new international distributor relationships. Management has recently focused its efforts on key markets within Latin America. However, with a more fulsome archery product line in development, the Company believes it is well positioned to expand into key international bowhunting markets such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Competitive Strengths
Innovation and Engineering Capabilities with Strong IP - Velocity is a consumer-focused organization with a deep understanding of our consumers. In addition, Velocity employs and retains engineers who are the most accomplished in our markets which, combined with an innovative culture, have created significantly differentiated, demonstrably superior products with strong intellectual property protection.
Leading Consumer Brands with Branding and Marketing Capabilities to Drive Consumer Awareness, Affinity and Engagement. Velocity owns a portfolio of premium, iconic brands that are leaders in consumer awareness and affinity. These include brands with a long, rich heritage such as Crosman and Benjamin airguns with 99 and 138 year histories, respectively, as well as the fast growing, super premium, and market disruptive brand like Ravin.
Broad Coverage of Consumer Segments and Price Points. Velocity’s portfolio of brands and product lines provides broad coverage of consumer segments and allows the business to position products with a combination of features and retail prices that appeal to all consumers in the category from recreational to avid.
Balanced Manufactured vs. Outsourced Production Model. Velocity retains high quality in-house product manufacturing capabilities while also outsourcing a balanced portion of its product line to vendors in low-cost manufacturing regions. This strategy is aligned with the broad portfolio of brands and product lines and reduces supply chain risk.
Diverse Customer Base. Velocity employs channel strategies that align with each brands market positioning. A brand’s channel strategy may favor independent specialty dealers and in other cases a significant presence in large chain retailers in best to maximize sales and profitability. Taken as a whole, this approach yields a broad and diverse customer base, limiting the reliance on any one customer while reaching all levels and types of consumers.
Competitive Conditions
Airguns - Velocity's airgun line competes with offerings from several airgun manufacturers, including Daisy Outdoor Products, Gamo Outdoor USA (which acquired Daisy in July 2016 but remains separately branded), and Germany-based Umarex. The market for airguns is relatively concentrated, led by Crosman, Daisy, Gamo, and Umarex, according to Sports OneSource data. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty.
Archery - The archery market competes within a “good, better, best” spectrum. Velocity's CenterPoint product line, as a value-for-price, entry to mid-level brand, tends to lie between the “good” and “better” segments, competing with Barnett Outdoors, Killer Instinct, and PSE Technologies, among others. Consumers tend to make purchasing decisions based on brand awareness, reliability, customer service, and pricing. Although CenterPoint is a recent entry into the archery market, the brand has been able to outpace more established brands on the reliability, pricing, and service aspects to win market share. The Ravin product line has a higher price point and falls within the "best" segment for crossbows, competing with the higher end Tenpoint crossbows. Ravin entered the market in 2017 and management believes has since become the number one selling brand as measured by retail dollars.
Suppliers and Manufacturing 
Suppliers
Velocity’s supply chain has both a domestic and foreign sourced component, where sourcing decisions are based on manufacturing expertise, cost, lead time, demand requirements as well as other factors. Finished goods manufacturing is balanced between domestic and offshore, largely from the Asia Pacific region. In addition to a well-seasoned supply chain team in the United States, Velocity Outdoor employs an Asian based Supply Chain team to support current sourced product and future growth. In general, raw materials utilized in Velocity’s products include steel, lead, plastics, and corrugated materials. There is ample capacity throughout the value-chain to fully support growth objectives.
Manufacturing
Velocity's product manufacturing is based on a dual strategy of in-house manufacturing and strategic alliances with select sub-contractors and vendors. Velocity conducts its domestic manufacturing operations in two locations. The first is a 225,000 square foot facility on a company-owned 49-acre campus located in East Bloomfield, New York, approximately 30 miles southeast of Rochester. The second is an 85,000 square foot leased facility in Superior, Wisconsin. In addition, the company utilizes approximately 144,000 square feet of leased warehouse space in nearby Farmington, New York, five miles from the East Bloomfield facility. 
Intellectual Property
Velocity Outdoor currently holds a global portfolio of more than 100 registered trademarks and a global patent portfolio of more than 50 issued patents with many more pending. Management considers its patent holdings, trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages.
Regulatory Environment
Airguns - Airguns enjoy a relatively unrestrictive federal regulatory framework, with most regulations determined at the state level. Although there are no federal laws regulating their transfer, possession or use, non-powder guns are subject to oversight from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CSPC”). Therefore, airguns are subject to generalized statutory limitations involving “substantial product hazard” and articles that pose a substantial risk of injury to children, though the CSPC has not adopted specific mandatory regulations in this area. Federal law 
prevents states from prohibiting the sale of airguns but allows for state-by-state restrictions on sales of airguns to minors. Thirteen states have imposed such restrictions. Historically, there have not been attempts to grandfather the regulation of airguns into that of traditional powdered firearms, as legislative efforts have largely focused on responding to and refining the existing regulatory framework for each respective category rather than overhauling the coordination or transfer of enforcement duties across agencies.
Archery - Crossbow hunting restrictions have become less stringent over the last several years. Since 2006, 12 states, including populous hunting states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, have legalized crossbow hunting, while many others moved to relax restrictions through the opening of limited seasons or creation of exceptions to hunting restrictions for those with disabilities. Today, only Oregon classifies crossbows as illegal but there is currently a proposal to allow crossbows during the all-weapon deer season in the eastern half of the state. Nearly 90% of all hunting permits are filed in states that currently allow crossbow hunting for at least part of the season. Although continued deregulation is expected, it likely will not be the largest driver for the crossbow category moving forward. Participation levels have steadily increased within the states. This will continue to be the main driver behind market growth moving forward.
Seasonality
Velocity typically has higher sales in the third and fourth quarter each year, reflecting the hunting and holiday seasons, respectively. 
Human Capital
Velocity had 383 employees on December 31, 2021, 349 full-time employees and 34 part-time employees, with 382 employees located within the United States. Velocity’s labor force is non-union. Management believes that Velocity has a good relationship with its employees.
Niche Industrial Businesses
Altor Solutions
Overview
Altor Solutions, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, is a designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components made from expanded polystyrene (EPS) and other expanded polymers. Altor provides products to a variety of end-markets, including appliances and electronics, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, grocery, automotive, building products and others. Altor's molded foam solutions offer shock and vibration protection, surface protection, temperature control, resistance to water absorption and vapor transmission and other protective properties critical for shipping small, delicate items, heavy equipment or temperature-sensitive goods. Altor operates 16 molding and fabricating facilities across North America, creating a geographic footprint of strategically located manufacturing plants to efficiently serve national customer accounts.
History of Altor Solutions
Altor Solutions was founded in 1957 and began its operations as a single plant in St. Louis, MO, dedicated to the manufacture of rigid foam plastics. Through the years, Altor expanded its geographic footprint, adding additional molding plants to its operation, as well as growing through acquisitions. Altor also opened two greenfield plants in Mexico to better serve their multinational manufacturing customers. 
In July 2020, Altor acquired the assets of Polyfoam, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of protective and temperature-sensitive packaging solutions for the medical, pharmaceutical, grocery and food industries, among others. In October 2021, Altor acquired Plymouth Foam, a designer and manufacturer of custom protective packaging solutions and componentry. Today, Altor operates out of its corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and 16 manufacturing facilities across North America. 
We purchased Altor on February 15, 2018.
Industry
Altor competes in the broadly defined global protective packaging market which we estimate was approximately $30 billion in 2021, with foam materials making up the largest component of this market. On the basis of product type, this market is segmented into rigid protective, flexible protective, and foam protective applications. Altor primarily 
competes in the North American foam protective packaging market which includes expanded polyurethane foams, loose fills, foam in place polyurethane, and molded foams products. Producers of molded foam products generally fall into two categories: block molders and shape molders. Block molders manufacture large blocks of EPS foam that are typically used as insulation in building products such as walls, roofs and floors and are closely tied to the construction market. Shape molders, such as Altor, manufacture customized molded foam solutions for protective packaging applications, insulated shipping containers and internal parts and components for OEMs. Products made of EPS foam have broad applications across various end markets due to a unique combination of performance characteristics. The superior cushioning and barrier properties paired with insulating and hydrophobic properties make it an ideal material for protective packaging of heavy or valuable goods as well as insulated shipping containers for temperature and moisture sensitive products. 
Products, Customers and Distribution Channels
Products
Altor Solutions designs and manufactures a broad array of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components serving various end markets. Altor's molded foam products are predominately made of expandable polystyrene (EPS), which is a rigid, closed-cell foam. EPS is comprised of polystyrene, a thermoplastic derived from the styrene monomer and benzene, and an added expansion agent, usually pentane. The final shape mold finished product is 98% air and is created in a low-pressure press which heats EPS beads that expand and fill a customer-specific mold. Altor also uses other moldable materials including expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE) depending on project and customer requirements. EPS foam is an environmentally friendly material that is fully recyclable, uses less energy to produce, generates fewer emissions and has less environmental impact than most competitive material options.
Altor Solutions’ custom-engineered molded foam products fall into four major categories: protective packaging, insulated shipping containers, OEM parts and componentry and fabricated foam. These products are used across a variety of end markets including consumer electronics, appliances, temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and food, automotive, home and office furnishings and building products among others. 
Protective Packaging - Altor Solutions creates custom molded corner pads, edge pads, “clear-view” packages and other protective foam packaging solutions for durable goods such as large and counter-top appliances, furniture, consumer electronics and military applications. Molded foam is an ideal protective packaging choice because it can be shaped into almost any form at tight tolerances and provides lightweight yet strong cushioning during product shipment. 
Insulated Shipping Containers - Transporting healthcare and pharmaceutical products requires complex logistical processes, specific equipment, storage facilities and special handling procedures to maintain product integrity. These requirements make EPS foam an ideal material to be used in insulated shipping containers due to its thermal insulation, water impermeability and shock absorbing properties. Similar to its uses in the healthcare industry, Altor manufactures insulated shipping containers for online grocers and meal delivery services to transport prepared meals and perishable food and beverage products that must be shipped in a temperature-controlled environment. 
OEM Parts and Componentry - Altor Solutions manufactures a variety of internal components used by OEMs as replacements for injection molded plastic or sheet metal parts across various end-markets. Compared to traditional plastic parts, foam offers vibration protection, insulation benefits, lower tooling costs and shorter lead times. Altor offers thin-wall molded air ducts and other internal components for household appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners. In the automotive sector, Altor manufactures foam door panels, trunk liners, bumper components, instrument panels, center consoles, side pillars, seat components and head rests. Foam is increasingly being used in new vehicle designs because it offers equivalent impact strength and toughness to traditional chassis materials with 10 to 40% less weight. Altor also makes products used in personal watercraft flotation and seating parts as well as recreational vehicle roof panels and core laminates that go underneath aluminum outer skins. Lastly, Altor produces building products for the construction market including insulated concrete forms. Insulated concrete forms are hollow sections of molded foam that construction crews stack into the shape of the walls of a building and fill with concrete to create the permanent structure.
Fabricated Foam - Altor Solutions also uses a variety of methods including die cutting, saw cutting, hot wire slicing and pressure cutting to create fabricated foam shapes as opposed to molded shapes. These products do not require tooling or dies so there is less upfront costs for the customer and are usually best suited for medium to low volume projects. Fabricated foam products represent a small portion of Altor overall net sales.

Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths
Business Strategies
Defend Market Position - As a leading supplier of custom molded foam solutions, management believes Altor enjoys strong brand awareness and a reputation for superior quality and service in the industry. In a market characterized by fragmented competition, Altor will continue to focus on providing a best in class suite of products and capabilities. 
Remain Committed to Customers - Functional and error-free products are key considerations for its customers and Altor has maintained a disciplined approach to ensure its products meet the highest standard of quality. Utilizing a balanced scorecard, Altor has achieved a 99.0% 1st piece acceptance rate, less than 2 complaints per 1000 shipments and a less than 0.05% rejection rate. As a result of this strong quality assurance, Altor has had little customer attrition. 
Pursue Selective Acquisitions - Altor Solutions views acquisitions as a potentially attractive means to expand its national footprint or broaden its current product offering. Management will continue to seek tuck-in acquisitions of regional foam molders and other packaging suppliers where sales and operational efficiencies can be realized, and to diversify into packaging products other than molded foam.
Competitive Strengths
National Scale and Proximity to Customers - Altor Solutions maintains a national footprint of 16 manufacturing locations across North America. Facilities are strategically located near customers’ production locations enabling Altor to be one of only a few foam molders capable of serving large national accounts. Due to foam’s high volume-to-weight ratio, foam manufacturers generally confine product shipments to a 300-mile radius in which shipping costs are economically viable. Thus, Altor is uniquely positioned to provide multi-facility support to its largest customers who often have multiple manufacturing or distribution locations. 
Engineering and Design Capabilities - Altor Solutions has five coordinated design and testing centers with experienced packaging and mechanical engineers that work closely with customers to support packaging design needs. Engineering services include optimizing molds to meet customer needs and address complex design 
requirements, identifying pre-manufacturing challenges, solving post-manufacturing issues, improving packaging processes and laboratory testing final designs. Early customer involvement and collaboration to develop packaging solutions has resulted in increased project win rates and better visibility into product development pipelines. 
Barriers to Entry 
•High Customer Switching Costs - The operational risk and disruption associated with switching existing molds to operate on a competitor’s press makes shifting or splitting business between different shape molders difficult and infrequent. In general, most customers pay for their own molds, which are custom built for a specific molders’ presses. The financial cost of retooling is estimated to be $5,000 - $25,000 per mold, making it cost prohibitive to change molders on existing projects.
•Favorable Cost-to-value Proposition - The high cost of failure, relatively low proportionate cost of foam to the final product being protected, and a sometimes lengthy testing and qualification process represent significant barriers to customers changing solution providers or packaging material choices.
•Equipment and Processing Infrastructure - Altor's existing base of production equipment has a significant estimated replacement cost. Management estimates the cost of opening a new shape molding facility at approximately $5 million, excluding real estate, and it must meet stringent environmental standards. A new entrant could require as much as 1-2 years of lead time to match the process performance requirements, customization of equipment and material formulations necessary to effectively compete in the molded foam industry. Moreover, Altor has a strong preventive maintenance program and in-house equipment division that is responsible for repairing and rebuilding presses. This allows Altor to significantly extend the average useful life of its machinery and reduce the ongoing capital investment requirements, creating an advantage over competitors. 
Suppliers and Manufacturing 
The primary raw materials that are used in production are plastic resins, such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE). In addition to plastic resins, Altor also purchases fabricating material including blocks of EPE and EPP foam, polyethylene and urethane, as well as other packaging materials including corrugate, boxes, paperboard, tape and plastic film. Altor purchases its materials from a combination of domestic and foreign suppliers and has maintained strong relationships with key resin suppliers for over 30 years. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Altor's management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future.
Altor maintains 16 manufacturing facilities across North America with 15 located in the U.S. and two in Mexico, as well as one non-manufacturing corporate headquarters. Given the high volume, low density nature of foam, Altor's manufacturing facilities are strategically located near its largest customers’ production locations to minimize freight and logistics costs. Altor's geographic footprint covers a large portion of the continental U.S. and Mexico. Each plant has a warehouse space for raw materials, supplies and finished goods. Several plants also use third-party warehousing to store excess inventory. Altor uses common carriers to deliver finished product and in certain cases, some customers pick up directly from the plants.
Regulatory Environment
Altor's manufacturing operations and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous materials. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, Altor employed 789 full-time employees. None of Altor's’ U.S.-based employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Under Mexican Federal Labor Law, 111 employees at the two Mexican manufacturing facilities are unionized. Altor believes its relationship with its employees is good.

History of Arnold
Arnold was founded in 1895 as the Arnold Electric Power Station Company. Arnold began producing AlNiCo permanent magnets in its Marengo, Illinois facility in the mid-1930s. In 1946, Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation (Allegheny) purchased Arnold, and over the next few years began production of several additional magnetic product lines under license agreement with the Western Electric Company. In 1970, Arnold acquired Ogallala Electronics, which manufactured high power coils and electromagnets.
SPS Technologies (SPS), at the time a publicly traded company, purchased Arnold Engineering Company from Allegheny in 1986. Under SPS, Arnold made a series of acquisitions and partnerships to expand its portfolio and geographic reach. In 2003, Precision Castparts, also a publicly traded company, acquired SPS. In January 2005, Audax, a Boston-based private equity firm acquired Arnold from Precision Castparts.
In February 2007, Arnold Magnetic Technologies completed the acquisition of Precision Magnetics, which expanded its geographic footprint to include operations in Sheffield, England and Lupfig, Switzerland.  In addition, Arnold’s Lupfig, Switzerland operation is a joint venture partner with a Chinese rare earth producer. The joint venture manufactures RECOMA® Samarium Cobalt blocks for select markets.
In 2016, Arnold developed and launched the world’s strongest Samarium Cobalt magnet grade, RECOMA 35E, that enables significant opportunity for increased performance in smaller packages, and at higher temperatures, with no trade off in stability. 
Through 2018 and 2019, Arnold deployed more advanced material from its PTM group such as Arnon 2 and 4 gauge electrical steels along with advanced performance molypermalloy metals. Advancements from the PMAG group during this same timeframe were targeted at magnet retention in high performance applications. The result of this hard work was the development of Carbon Fiber sleeving capabilities at its Sheffield UK facility. Lastly, Flexmag also introduced customized highly loaded composite materials for a variety of applications. In 2021, Arnold acquired Ramco Electric Motors, Inc. ("Ramco"), a provider of custom electric motor solutions for general industrial, 
aerospace and defense and oil and gas end markets. Ramco's complementary product portfolio will allow Arnold to offer more comprehensive, turn-key solutions to their customers.
We purchased a majority interest in Arnold on March 5, 2012.

History of Sterno 
Sterno’s history dates back to 1893 when S. Sternau & Co. began making chafing dishes and coffee percolators in Tenafly, New Jersey. In 1914, S. Sternau & Co. introduced “canned heat” with the launch of its gelled ethanol product under the “Sterno” brand. Since then, the Sternau and Sterno names have been the most well-known names in portable food warming fuel. In 1917, S. Sternau & Co. was renamed The Sterno Corporation. During World War I, Sterno portable stoves were promoted as an essential gift for soldiers going to fight in the trenches of Europe. Sterno stoves heated water and rations, sterilized surgical instruments, and provided light and warmth in bunkers and foxholes. During World War II, Sterno produced ethanol and methanol chafing fuels under contract with the U.S. military. Sterno's production facilities were moved from New Jersey to Texarkana, Texas in the early 1980s. In 2012, Sterno merged with the Candle Lamp Company, LLC ("CandleLamp"). CandleLamp, founded in Riverside, California in 1978, focused initially on the liquid wax candle market. Over the next several decades, CandleLamp began to supply chafing fuel in addition to lighting products.
In 2016, Sterno expanded their product offering with the acquisition of Northern International Inc. ("Sterno Home"). The success in the outdoor lighting of an innovative use of LED technology evolved into the development of patented flameless candle product line. In February 2018, Sterno acquired Rimports, a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label wickless candle products used for home decor and fragrance systems. Rimports offers unique lines of wickless candle products including ceramic wax warmers, scented wax cubes and essential oil and diffusers. 
Today, Sterno operates out of its corporate headquarters in Corona, California, two manufacturing facilities in Texarkana, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee, and the Rimports facility in Provo, Utah.
We purchased Sterno on October 10, 2014.
Industry 
Sterno Products competes in the broadly defined U.S. foodservice industry where historically restaurant, catering and hospitality sales have accounted for approximately 60% - 70% of the market with the remainder comprised of the travel and leisure, education and healthcare related sales. The Sterno Products product offerings focus on safe, portable fire solutions for cooking and warming, as well as tabletop lighting décor. 
Rimports operates in the broad North American home decor space (retail) which is heavily correlated to general consumer spending. Flameless and reusable wax products have seen increased adoption by younger consumers 
who prioritize economical and environmentally friendly products. Within the home decor space, Rimports competes in the U.S. candle space and the U.S. home fragrance space, and, with the integration of Sterno Home, has added the flameless candles, lanterns and outdoor lighting industry. Management believes that a rise in demand from high-income households and businesses will bolster growth, with consumers spending more money on the cocooning trend and specifically on beautifying their indoor and outdoor home, changing out trendy accent items more frequently and investing in more spacious and comfortable outdoor spaces with many equivalent amenities of their indoor spaces.
Sterno is a “full-line” supplier offering a broad array of portable chafing fuels, table lighting, outdoor lighting products, wickless candles and fragrance products with approximately 4000 SKUs serving the foodservice and retail markets. Sterno originally focused on chafing fuel (“canned heat”) products and later expanded its offerings to include table ambiance products such as liquid wax, wax candles and votive lamps, as well as outdoor lighting with the acquisition of Sterno Home in 2016, and wax cubes and warmer products through its acquisition of Rimports. Sterno’s products fall into six major categories: canned heat, catering equipment and butane products, table lighting, flameless candles and outdoor lighting, wickless candle and fragrance products.
Products, Customers and Distribution Channels
Products
Canned Heat - The canned heat product line is composed of various chafing fuels packaged in small, portable cans. The portable warming (canned heat) line is composed of wick-based and gel-based chafing fuels packaged in steel cans. These products are used by foodservice professionals in a variety of food serving and holding applications and are designed to keep food products at an optimal food-safe serving temperature of 140-165 Fahrenheit. The canned heat product line is composed of two subcategories: wick chafing fuel and gel chafing fuel. The subcategories are distinguished based on the type of chafing fuel being used; the four primary chafing fuels are diethylene glycol (“DEG”), propylene glycol, ethanol and methanol. Each fuel contains unique characteristics and properties that allow the Company to offer a broad array of configurations to suit varying user requirements.
•Wick Chafing Fuel - The wick chafing fuel line (“Wick”) is composed of either DEG or propylene glycol chafing fuel. DEG and propylene glycol chafing fuels with advance wick technology have higher heat output than alternatives such as ethanol and methanol. The liquid Wick products feature a variety of wick types and burn times to meet the specific needs of the user. Wick fuels are clean burning, biodegradable, nonflammable if spilled (will not ignite without a wick) and the can stays cool to the touch when lit.
•Gel Chafing Fuel - The gel chafing fuel line (“Gel”) is composed of either gelled ethanol or gelled methanol chafing fuel. Ethanol chafing fuel has a higher heat output than methanol fuel; both ethanol and methanol fuels have lower heat output than some DEG and propylene glycol products. The Gel product line tends to have shorter burn times than the Wick product.
For an environmentally preferred chafing fuel, the Company offers a patented line of “Green” chafing fuels featuring USDA Certified Biobased Product formulas that are also endorsed by the Green Restaurant Association. The “Green Heat” and “Green Wick” products perform similar to the Wick and Gel chafing fuels, but are made from renewable resources that are biodegradable and more environmentally friendly.
Catering Equipment - Catering equipment products are designed to provide a complete commercial catering solution whether indoor or outdoor. Products include chafing dish frames and lids, wind guards and buffet sets.
Butane - Sterno produces a full line of professional quality portable butane stoves, ideal for action stations, made-to-order omelet lines, tableside and off-site cooking, outdoor events and more. Products also include select butane accessories for special culinary applications such as the culinary torch. Sterno butane fuel comes with an additional safety feature called Countersink Release Vent (CRV) Technology.
Table Lighting - Sterno sells a variety of items designed to enhance lighting and ambiance at meal settings which are critical to a customer’s experience. Products include liquid wax, traditional hard wax and flameless electronic candles, as well as votive lamps, shaded lamps and accent lamps.
Flameless Candles and Outdoor Lighting - Sterno offers a wide selection of lighting for your home, garden, patio and yard with over 1000 SKU's available in our retail markets. All of Sterno's products are powered by one of the following - 1) Solar - solar panel with rechargeable power source - usually a rechargeable battery; 2) Battery - battery operated; 3) Plug-in - plugs directly into a regular wall socket either with 2 or 3 prong plug and with or without included and attached transformer; 4) Low Voltage - part of a set which includes a stand-alone transformer. Fixtures connect through a stand-alone wire via clip connectors; 5) Line Voltage - hardwired into a home's electrical circuitry, or 6) Rechargeable - product is recharged when empty usually through a plug in wire and an onboard rechargeable power source.
•Flameless Candles - The flameless candle product line is made up of various types and sizes of candles with all of them sharing the one main attribute: their glow is powered by an artificial power source, most often battery. This makes them inherently safer than traditional candles as there is no flame or even heat generated to cause any type of accidents. Although pillar type candles are the most common shape, Sterno also designs and manufactures votives, tealights, tapers as well as specialty molded candles. Sterno candles stand out from the competition as they are the only manufacturer that offers the patented black wick. Sterno also developed its unique algorithm-based light circuit which gives the candle a naturally random flicker and glow.
•Landscape Lighting - Landscape lighting is lighting that promotes and accentuates elements of a consumer’s home, yard or garden so its beauty can be enjoyed both in daytime and nighttime. Another benefit of landscape lighting is added safety as it is easier to navigate around a home at night when it is reasonably well-lit. Landscape lighting was originally most commonly powered through a low voltage setup but as solar technologies have rapidly developed, many of these fixtures can achieve their lighting purposes with only a solar panel for power generation. Consumers with higher and more consistent lighting requirements most often opt for low voltage kits using wire and transformers to light their fixtures. Solar powered fixtures are advantageous for those consumers looking for cheaper and quicker to set up lighting solutions even if it often means less lumens and light. Another notable technology has been the development of LED lighting. LED’s more efficient power generation technology has allowed for advantageous fixture designs and a higher level of power generation which were not easy or as cost effective to achieve as with legacy lighting technologies such as incandescent or halogen. LEDs also last longer and are generally more robust than older technologies. 
•Décor Lighting - Décor lighting has similar functions to landscape lighting but is usually less about safety and functionality and more about accenting an area of the outside home with ornamentation of some sort. With a décor piece, the light the piece gives off and the item itself together become elements of beauty in the setting. Because these items are very trend driven, consumers are more apt to switch them out more often therefore increasing repeat purchase potential and other recurrent sales opportunities for Sterno. Some of the most common categories of décor lighting are lanterns and baskets and string lighting.
Wickless Candle and Fragrance Products 
•WaxWarmers and Scented Wax Cubes - The wax and wax warmer line is composed of a large variety of fragrance and warmer design choices for consumers. The wax cubes are long-lasting and consistently release strong fragrance. The consumer likes the product because the scented wax cubes are an impulse item ($2~ price range) and this product makes it easy and quick for the customer to change fragrance. The flameless feature is a plus in that it is very safe. The proprietary formula and world-class fragrances add to the high quality of the domestically-made products. Ongoing research ensures consumer loyalty, superior quality, and well-rounded fragrance programs. The wax warmers are made up of quality materials including wood, metal, ceramic, and glass.
•Essential Oils and Diffusers - The 100% Pure Essential Oil lines and brands consists of Peppermint, Lavender, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Tea tree, Cinnamon, etc. Customers are attracted 
to high quality, 100 percent pure oil products with no additives or fillers. Attractively designed diffusers appeal to consumers in the Aromatherapy Home Fragrance section.
•ScentCharms - ScentCharms is Rimports’ newest product category. With various interchangeable high-quality fragrance oils and plug-in designs, consumers enjoy a personalized experience. The product is designed to be no spill, no mess, clutter-free, and long-lasting.
•Aromatherapy Products - The aromatherapy line consists of room sprays, liquid hand soaps, foaming hand soaps, hand sanitizers, body lotions, and body scrubs, etc. The five unique fragrance combinations - lavender and chamomile, eucalyptus and rosemary, orange and vanilla, lemon and grapefruit, and peppermint and geranium - are made with 100 percent pure essential oils.

Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths
Business Strategies
Defend Leading Market Position - As a leading supplier of canned fuels, flameless candles and outdoor lighting, wickless candles and fragrance products, Sterno’s places great value delivering unmatched customer service and product selection. In a market characterized by fragmented categories and competition, Sterno will continue to focus on providing the best in class service to its customers. Sterno Products has been the recipient of numerous vendor awards for its high degree of customer service.
Pursue Selective Acquisitions - Sterno views acquisitions as a potentially attractive means to expand its product offerings in the foodservice and retail channels as well as enter new international markets. 
Expand Retail Distribution - Sterno’s management believes that there is an opportunity to leverage the iconic nature of the “Sterno Products” brand to expand its retail product offering and to expand distribution into additional retailers. 
Create Innovative Products - Having innovative design, marketing, and production teams enables Rimports to expand into new fragrance systems markets, as it has done with Essential Oil Diffusers and ScentCharms (Decorative Liquid plug-in fragrance units). Rimports will continue to focus on providing the best quality products and low prices to retailers and end-users.
Competitive Strengths 
Leading Brand Recognition & Market Share - Sterno Products is the market share leader in the canned chafing fuel market. Management believes Sterno Products enjoys outstanding brand awareness and a reputation for superior quality and performance with distributors, caterers, hotels and other end users. Sterno Home offers a wide variety of products to a cross section of North American retail and its diversity gives us a unique standing in this marketplace. Most of Sterno Home's competitors specialize in one aspect of fulfilling the market. They either only sell to a few retailers or only actively develop few or even only one category of product. This exposes them to major financial challenges when they lose that account or when that product is beat out by a competitor or starts to wane in the marketplace. Rimports is a leader in fragrance systems, particularly the wickless candle market, and is growing its market share in the essential oils and diffusers and plug-in liquid fragrance markets. Rimports offers a large variety of products to retailers in North America, Canada, China, and the United Kingdom.
Low Cost versus Alternatives - Sterno Product's customers are typically caterers, hotels or restaurants who utilize canned chafing fuel to maintain prepared food at a safe and enjoyable serving temperature. The risk of ruining a dining experience and the low proportionate cost of canned chafing fuel relative to the cost of a catered event represent significant barriers to customers switching out of Sterno’s canned chafing fuel products. Additionally, management believes that there is no other technology available today that offers the portability, reliability and low cost of the Sterno canned chafing fuel products. Rimports’ ultimate consumers seek high quality products in the Home Fragrance section. This high value strength ensures consumer loyalty and satisfaction.
Suppliers and Manufacturing 
Sterno's product manufacturing is based on a dual strategy of in-house manufacturing and strategic alliances with select vendors. Sterno operates an efficient, low-cost supply chain, sourcing materials and employing contract manufacturers from across the Asia-Pacific region and the U.S.
Sterno Products' primary raw materials are Diethylene glycol, ethanol, liquid paraffin and steel cans for which it receives multiple shipments per month. Sterno Products purchases its materials from a combination of domestic and foreign suppliers. 
Rimports sources raw materials from and outsources manufacturing processes to companies in the U.S. and China. Raw materials include wax, fragrances, and color dye for waxes; essential oils; wood, metal, ceramic, and glass for warmers and diffusers; and packaging supplies. Products are shipped to retailers from outsourced manufacturing warehouses and Rimports’ two Utah warehouses. The Sterno Home product lines are sources entirely from China.
Intellectual Property 
Sterno relies upon a combination of trademarks and patents in order to secure and protect its intellectual property rights. Sterno currently owns approximately 269 registered trademarks and 74 patents globally, and has 28 applications for patents pending. 
Regulatory Environment
Sterno is proactive regarding regulatory issues and management believes that it is in compliance with all relevant regulations. Sterno maintains adequate product liability insurance coverage. Management believes that Sterno is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations.
