--------+---------

General Business and Products Description
 
International Isotopes Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) produces an FDA approved generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product, manufactures a wide range of nuclear medicine calibration and reference standards, and provides radiochemicals for clinical research and life sciences. The Company also produces a variety of cobalt-60 products and supports contract manufacturing activities for clients radiopharmaceutical and radiochemical products.
 
We were formed as a Texas corporation in 1995. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries are International Isotopes Idaho Inc., a Texas corporation; International Isotopes Fluorine Products, Inc., an Idaho corporation; International Isotopes Transportation Services, Inc., an Idaho corporation; RadQual, LLC, a [X] limited liability company (RadQual); and TI Services, LLC, a [X] limited liability company (TI Services). Our core business consists of five reportable segments which include: Nuclear Medicine Standards, Cobalt Products, Radiochemical Products, Radiological Services, and Fluorine Products.
 
During 2021, we focused our efforts on achieving profitability in each of our core business segments and reached several significant goals. During 2021, we:

Also, in February 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of certain assets (the “Assets”) to Pharmalogic Idaho, LLC for $4.0 million in cash (the “Transaction”) pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated February 10, 2022 (the “Agreement”). The Assets consisted primarily of manufacturing equipment and a sublease acquired by the Company in connection with the previously announced termination of the manufacturing and supply agreement with another company.
 In 2022, we plan to continue efforts to further expand and improve upon our operations in our core business segments. We intend to continue to invest in these segments and work to pursue product development, reduce production costs, and expand sales in each of our segments. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of each of our business segments. Certain financial information with respect to each of our business segments, including revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets, is set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements which begin on page F-7.
 
Nuclear Medicine Standards
 
This segment consists of the manufacture of sources and standards associated with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, patient positioning, and calibration or operational testing of dose measuring equipment for the nuclear pharmacy industry. Our nuclear medicine standards products include flood sources, dose calibrators, rod sources, flexible and rigid rulers, spot markers, pen point markers, and a host of specialty design items. These products are manufactured through an exclusive manufacturing agreement with our wholly-owned subsidiary, RadQual. In July 2021, we purchased the remaining 75.5% interest of RadQual. Prior this purchase we were one of two managing members of RadQual and had significant influence in management decisions with regard to RadQual’s business operations. Following the July 2021 acquisition, we have now fully consolidated the income and expenses from both RadQual LLC and TI Services.
 
There are over 5,000 nuclear medicine centers in the United States (U.S.) that require nuclear medicine products on a regular repeat basis. We have been manufacturing these products for RadQual since 2001. Most nuclear medicine product sales are to U.S. customers. However, in recent years, because of stronger marketing efforts, we have seen an increase in foreign sales, as shown in Note 14 to the accompanying audited financial statements. All these products contain radioactive isotopes that decay at a predictable rate. Therefore, customers are required to periodically replace most of these products when they reach the end of their useful lives. The useful life of these products varies depending on the isotope used in manufacture, but in most cases averages eighteen months to two years. Most of the isotopes used in manufacturing these nuclear medicine products are available from various sources world-wide and we are not dependent on a single supplier. In addition to the products themselves, we have developed a complete line of specialty packaging for the safe transportation and handling of these products.
 
Cobalt Products
 
Our cobalt products segment includes the production of bulk cobalt (cobalt-60), fabrication of cobalt capsules for radiation therapy as well as various industrial applications, and recycling of expended cobalt sources.
 
Bulk cobalt sales have historically accounted for a significant amount of the total revenue from this business segment, and we are reliant on cobalt production in the DOE’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) located in Idaho. Through continued work with the DOE, a new cobalt target was designed and in October 2014 we entered into a ten-year agreement with the DOE for the irradiation of the new target design. In 2020 and 2021, we received shipments of these cobalt targets. Unfortunately, their specific activity was far below expectations. As such, we revised our contract with the DOE to purchase the remainder of these cobalt targets at a discounted rate. We are again working with the DOE to schedule future production of both high and low specific activity cobalt. After completing the 2014 agreement with the DOE, we entered into contracts with several customers for the sale of this material. In accordance with those agreements, we began receiving pre-payments from customers on future cobalt shipments which we recorded as unearned revenue. We were able to fulfill some of these contracts with the cobalt we received in 2020 and 2021 from the ATR and with cobalt we obtained through secondary suppliers. Accordingly, at the time of shipment, customer payments previously recorded as deferred revenue were reclassified as revenue.
 
The year-over-year demand for cobalt products has remained strong as a result of the introduction of several new types of cobalt therapy units and we have continued to see demand for cobalt-manufactured products for those devices. We have explored, and intend to continue to explore, opportunities to further develop cobalt products and sales on an on-going basis. The production, use, transport, and import/export of these products are all heavily regulated, but we have developed an experienced staff of technicians, shipping specialists, and supervisors as part of our efforts to comply with the regulations and support cost effective, timely delivery of these products.
 
At the present time, we are the sole purchaser of high activity cobalt from any of the DOE reactors in the U.S. There are a few other cobalt source manufacturers in North America. We believe both our product and service provide us with a competitive edge in competing with these other manufacturers.

Radiochemical Products
 
This segment includes the production and distribution of various isotopically pure radiochemicals for medical, industrial, and research applications. These products are either directly produced by us or are purchased in bulk from other producers and distributed by us in customized packages and chemical forms tailored to meet customer and market demands. In February 2020, we received FDA approval of our ANDA for our generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product. Our generic sodium iodide drug product is the only generic product of this type manufactured in the U.S. and offers customers an attractive domestic alternative to the single existing foreign commercial drug manufacturer. We have two suppliers of sodium iodide I-131 from whom we purchased material during 2021 to produce this product in the most reliable manner possible.
 
In April 2019, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a company to provide contract manufacturing services for certain iodine products. We completed a 6,000 square foot expansion to our existing facility and installed the equipment necessary to support this cGMP contract manufacturing opportunity. However, in December 2020, at the request of the other company we terminated the contract manufacturing relationship through a settlement agreement. As part of the agreement, we received a termination payment consisting of cash and the other company’s relinquishment on all claims to their improvements in the expansion to our facility and all the equipment purchased by them. The termination payment resulted in a significant one-time gain of approximately $2,900,000 which we recognized under “other income” in 2020. In February 2022, we were able to sell these improvements and equipment in the expansion of our facility for an additional gain of approximately $1,800,000.
 
Radiological Services
 
The current services included in this segment are radioactive source disposal and processing certain materials for exempt distribution.
 
On May 2, 2019, our radiological services team was involved in a contamination event involving a breached cesium-137 source at an off-site location in the state of Washington. This work was being performed under a contract with the DOE. On January 5, 2021, we were notified by the DOE that we had been indemnified from any financial liability for this event under the Price Anderson Act (PAA). As part of this indemnification notification, we received payment in full for our claim with the DOE for recovery of certain expenses incurred for this event. We recognized Other Income of approximately $150,000 in the 2021, for additional cost recoveries for this event. All remaining cost recoveries as part of this settlement with the DOE were recognized in previous financial periods pursuant to ASC 410-30. We used these funds to pay all outstanding subcontractors and reimburse their insurance company for payments they previously paid to us for this matter. We concluded a final settlement with our insurance company and all others regarding this claim in 2021.
 
Our corrective actions for this event included termination of all field service activities and removal of these activities from the Company’s NRC license. The loss in revenue resulting from suspension of radiological field service work has been compensated for by increased revenues in our remaining business segments.
 
In January 2020 we notified our gemstone processing customer that we were terminating their contract for a failure to meet minimum processing volume requirements. The termination activities and wrap up of this service was substantially concluded in 2021 and we saw a steady decline in revenue from this service as production has been concluding. In the first half of 2022, we plan to convert the spaces in the facility that had been used to perform this contract work into expanded Nuclear Medicine product manufacturing. The loss in revenue expected from termination of the gemstone processing agreement is expected to be more than compensated for by the expansion of sales in our nuclear medicine and radiochemical products segments.
 
Fluorine Products and the Planned Uranium De-Conversion Facility
 
We established the fluorine products business segment in 2004 to support production and sale of various fluoride gases produced using our Fluorine Extraction Process (FEP). FEP was intended to be completed in conjunction with the operation of a proposed depleted uranium (DUF6) de-conversion facility in Lea County, New Mexico. DUF6 is the waste by-product of uranium enrichment, and any uranium enrichment facility will create very large quantities of DUF6. In October 2012, we received a construction and operating license from the NRC for the planned facility. Changes in the nuclear industry near the end of 2013, however, significantly reduced commercial demand for this type of facility. Therefore, we suspended all further development work on the project. We still anticipate a potential future need for a depleted uranium conversion facility and, therefore, we are keeping all licenses and permits current.
 
In connection with the proposed de-conversion facility, Lea County, New Mexico transferred property to us under the provisions of the New Mexico Local Economic Development Act, Project Participation Agreement (PPA) as a location for construction of the facility. Under the original agreement, we were obligated to meet certain performance objectives for construction start and staffing levels. Because of the project delay we did not meet those objectives. We plan to continue to work with Lea County to execute a modification to the agreement at some future point should the project move forward. If we do not extend or modify the commitment

dates in a modified agreement then we may either purchase or re-convey the property to Lea County, New Mexico. If we do not retain title to the property, it could have a material adverse impact on future plans for the project.
 
Industry Overview, Target Markets, and Competition
 
The industries and markets that require or involve the use of radioactive material are diverse. Our current core business operations involve products that are used in a wide variety of applications and in various markets. The following provides an explanation of the markets and competitive factors affecting our current business segments.
Nuclear Medicine Standards
 
Calibration and reference standards are required for the daily operational checks and calibration of the measurement of SPECT and PET imaging devices frequently used in nuclear medicine. Calibration and quality assurance testing are required as a routine part of the normal operations of this equipment to ensure its reliability and accuracy. We exclusively manufacture many of these reference standard products for our wholly-owned subsidiary, RadQual, which in turn has many distributors who make direct sales in the U.S. and internationally. We directly ship these products to all 50 states and many overseas locations. There is only one other major producer of these products in the world that competes directly with us for these products. Most of the products manufactured by our competitor are similar in design to our products because all must meet Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) dimensional and performance standards. However, we attempt to differentiate our products from our competitor’s products through increased levels of quality control and customer service. We are certified under ISO-9001:2015 and ISO-13485-2016 quality programs that have allowed us to start selling these products into several foreign countries that require this additional quality certification for manufacturers. We use a small number of suppliers for the isotopes and other materials used in manufacturing these nuclear medicine products, but if we were to lose any of these suppliers, others would be available. We are also working to expand the number and types of products that are manufactured in this segment.
Cobalt Products
 
In 2014, we entered into a new 10-year agreement with the DOE utilizing a new cobalt target design for high activity cobalt production. Because of the lengthy irradiation time required we initially anticipated that cobalt shipments to customers would resume in late 2018. However, due to delays in the ATR operating schedule we were not able to take our first shipment of these targets until March 2020. Due to lower than desired activity rates in the material, we bought the remaining targets at a discounted rate and are now working with the DOE on future purchases. Our cobalt products are used in applications such as radiation therapy, security devices, radiography examination and in some commercial applications. While there are other technologies available to provide external radiation therapy, there are several new devices just gaining market approval that still depend on cobalt sources for their specialized applications. There are currently no other producers of high specific activity cobalt in the U.S., however, there are producers of high specific activity material in Canada and several other countries. In addition to us, there is only one other company in the U.S. currently licensed to handle large quantities of cobalt.
 
There has been a significant increase in regulation by the NRC in recent years that has created a significant barrier to new entrants to this market. We expect steady demand for cobalt sealed source products over the next several years but are primarily dependent upon our contract relationship with the DOE for a large portion of our cobalt production supply. An interruption in the operation of the ATR could have a negative impact on our cobalt products business segment.
 
Radiochemical Products
 
In February 2020, our ANDA for a generic radiochemical sodium iodide drug product was approved by the FDA. This product is approved for use in treatment of hyperthyroidism and carcinoma of the thyroid and is the first and only generic sodium iodide I-131 product approved by the FDA in the US. Our product is the only generic product of this type manufactured in the U.S. The only other supplier in the U.S. of an FDA approved sodium iodide product comes from a foreign manufacturer.
 
We started commercial sales of the drug product in the first quarter of 2020, and these sales had a significant positive impact on our revenues for 2020 and 2021. We expect continued growth in sales for this product in 2022 and beyond. We are also considering other generic drug opportunities and plan to expand the range of FDA approved products offered within this business segment in the coming years.
 
We also supply radiochemical products in bulk form. The markets for most radiochemicals are highly competitive. The target markets for these products are customers who (1) incorporate them into finished industrial or medical devices; (2) use radioisotope products in clinical trials for various medical applications; or (3) further process and include the radioisotope products into pharmaceutical products approved by the U.S. FDA for labeled use in therapy or imaging.

In February 2022, we sold the improvements and equipment in our expansion to our manufacturing facility. Using the capital from this sale, we are currently developing a business plan and exploring other opportunities to produce additional radiopharmaceutical products or explore new contract manufacturing opportunities. We believe that we are uniquely qualified and have a competitive advantage for future opportunities because we have a unique combination of NRC licensing, GMP compliant operating facility, and trained personnel.
 
Fluorine Products and the Planned Depleted Uranium De-Conversion Facility
 
Our Fluorine Products segment was developed in conjunction with uranium de-conversion to take advantage of the anticipated need for depleted uranium de-conversion services. During 2013, we curtailed all further work on the de-conversion facility because of a lack of demand for uranium de-conversion services at that time. However, we believe that in the future there will be a demand for this service to address still growing stockpiles of depleted UF6. When that demand occurs, we believe the groundwork we have completed on the depleted uranium de-conversion and fluorine extraction project should put us in a strong position to take advantage of the NRC license that has already been issued for this facility and should serve to justify the financial investment in this uranium de-conversion project in the future.
Radiological Services
 
In previous years, we performed radiological field service activities involving installation or decommissioning of radiation devices in hospitals, research institutions, and various other commercial facilities. In May 2019, while performing a contract for the DOE, our field services team was involved in a contamination event involving a breached cesium-137 source at an off-site location in the state of Washington. Because of the severity of this event, we suspended these contract activities and have removed this activity from our NRC license. We believe that the loss in revenue resulting from suspension of radiological field service work will be compensated for by increased revenues in our remaining business segments.
 
In January 2020 we notified our gemstone processing customer that the service contract with them was being terminated because the volume of gemstones sent for processing did not meet contract minimums. The termination activities and wrap up of this service were substantially performed in 2021 and we saw a steady decline in revenue from this service as production was wrapped up. In the first half of 2022, we plan to convert the spaces in the facility that were used to perform this contract work into increased Nuclear Medicine product manufacturing. The loss in revenue expected from termination of the gemstone processing agreement is expected to be more than compensated for by the expansion of new nuclear medicine source products.
 
Government Regulation
 
Licensing
 
We currently operate under two NRC licenses, one for broad scope operations and another for exempt distribution. Our broad scope license covers calibration and reference standard manufacturing and distribution, radioisotope processing and distribution, large scale cobalt processing and recycle operations, radioactive gemstone processing, environmental sample analysis, certain field service activities, and research and development. The exempt distribution license permits the release and distribution of irradiated gemstones to unlicensed entities in the U.S. All of our existing licenses and permits are adequate to allow current business operations. We do not handle “special nuclear materials” (i.e. nuclear fuels and weapons grade uranium, thorium or plutonium); therefore, our facility is not designated as a “nuclear” facility that would require additional licensing.
 
As a condition of our NRC licenses in Idaho, we are required to provide financial assurance for decommissioning activities. We fulfill this license requirement with a surety bond which names the NRC as beneficiary and is supported by a restricted cash account held in trust by a third party. Similar financial assurances will be required to fund the decommissioning of the proposed de-conversion facility.
 
In October 2012, we were granted a 40-year construction and operating license by the NRC for our planned depleted uranium de-conversion and fluorine extraction processing facility (the “de-conversion facility”). The de-conversion facility is planned to be located in Lea County, New Mexico. Further engineering work on the proposed de-conversion facility was placed on hold in 2013 until additional contracts for utilization could be obtained. There is no specific timeline required by the NRC for the start of construction on this project. The majority of the pre-construction design, licensing and state permitting has already been completed for the project and a ground water permit from the state of New Mexico remains to be obtained before the plant could begin operation.

Regulation of Radioisotope Production Waste
 
All our manufacturing processes generate some radioactive waste. We must handle this waste pursuant to the Low-Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) Policy Act (LLRW Act), which requires the safe disposal of mildly radioactive materials. The estimated costs for storage and disposal of these materials have been included in the manufacturing and sales price of our products. However, actual disposal costs are subject to change at the discretion of the disposal site and are ultimately applied at the time of disposal. We have obtained all necessary permits and approvals for the disposal of our waste materials, and we do not anticipate any negative changes in capacity or regulatory conditions that would limit or restrict our waste disposal capabilities.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission Oversight
 
We operate under two NRC licenses and are subject to NRC oversight and periodic inspections of our operations.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are registered as a medical device manufacturer through the FDA for several of our nuclear medicine reference and calibration standards. We are registered with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the shipment of radioactive materials. We also have an NRC license for the import and export of radioactive materials. Because of increasing security controls and regulations, it is likely that we may encounter additional regulations affecting transportation, storage, sale, and import/export of radioactive materials.
 
We are also subject to inspection by the FDA to manufacture our sodium iodide I-131 product in compliance with our ANDA for sodium iodide I-131 and all applicable cGMP requirements for this and other contract manufactured products. We are registered with the FDA as a drug manufacturing facility, and we are subject to periodic and random inspections by the FDA for the continued manufacture of drug products.
 
We are subject to government regulation and intervention both in the U.S. and in all foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to current regulations with which we must comply can necessitate further capital expenditures and increases in operating costs to enable continued compliance.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and state statutes such as the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act, the LLRW Policy Act, NRC regulations concerning various irradiated, radioactive, and depleted uranium materials, and U.S. DOT regulations concerning shipment of radioactive materials. Certain of these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred costs of approximately $52,000 and $190,171, respectively, for licensing and monitoring fees. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Distribution Methods for Products
 
We sell our products directly to our customers who, in some cases, are both end users and distributors. We use common commercial carriers for delivery of our products. For smaller quantities of material, and overnight and next-day delivery, we utilize other commercial carriers.
Dependence on Customers
 
Historically, we have been dependent on one customer, RadQual, of which we owned 24.5%, for a significant amount of our gross revenue. In July 2021, we purchased the remaining 75.5% of the ownership interest in RadQual, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. Our sales to RadQual for 2021 accounted for approximately 28% of our total gross revenue for 2021 and our sales to RadQual for 2020 totaled approximately 26% of our total gross revenue for 2020. The change in ownership of RadQual has substantially eliminated any risks associated with having RadQual as a single major customer.

-

Combined sales, on which we are dependent, to our three largest customers, accounted for 17% of our total gross revenues in 2021 and accounted for 11% of our total gross revenues in 2020.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Royalty Agreements
 
In 2004, we obtained certain patents related to the FEP. In 2010, we were granted an additional process patent on the FEP process. During 2012, we were granted additional process patents for the FEP process in the United States.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 32 total employees, including 30 full-time employees.
