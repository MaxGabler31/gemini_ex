ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. (“Heidrick & Struggles”) is a human capital leadership advisory firm providing executive search, consulting and on-demand talent services to businesses and business leaders worldwide by helping them to improve the effectiveness of their leadership teams. When we use the terms “Heidrick & Struggles,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” in this Form 10-K, we mean Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. We provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 430 consultants located in major cities around the world. Heidrick & Struggles and its predecessors have been a leadership advisor for more than 60 years. Heidrick & Struggles was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1999 when two of our predecessors merged to form Heidrick & Struggles.
Our service offerings include the following:
Executive Search. We partner with our clients - respected organizations across the globe - to help them build and sustain the best leadership teams in the world, with a specialized focus on the placement of top-level senior executives. Through our unique relationship-based, data-driven approach, we help our clients find the right leaders, set them up for success, and accelerate their and their team’s performance.
We believe focusing on top-level senior executives provides the opportunity for several competitive advantages including access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search and consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility, and a leveraged global footprint. Working at the top of client organizations also facilitates the attraction and retention of high-caliber consultants who desire to serve top industry executives and their leadership needs. Our executive search services derive revenue through the fees generated for each search engagement, which generally are based on the annual compensation for the placed executive. We provide our executive search services primarily on a retained basis.
We employ a global approach to executive search built on better insights, more data and faster decision making facilitated by the use of our Infinity Framework and Heidrick Connect. Our Infinity Framework allows clients to holistically evaluate a candidate's pivotal experience and expertise, leadership capabilities, agility and potential, and culture fit and impact, thereby allowing our clients to find the right person for the role. We supplement our Infinity Framework through a series of additional online tools including our Leadership Accelerator, Leadership Signature and Culture Signature assessments. Heidrick Connect, a completely digital, always available client experience portal allows our clients to access talent insights for each engagement, including the Infinity Framework and other internally developed assessment tools. In response to working remotely, our Executive Search teams employed Heidrick Connect to operate effectively and efficiently while engaging virtually with our clients. Additionally, we have introduced upgrades to Heidrick Connect, resulting in greater flexibility, increased productivity and the ability to deliver more insights to our clients.
The executive search industry consists of several thousand executive search firms worldwide. Executive search firms are generally separated into two broad categories: retained search and contingency search. Retained executive search firms fulfill their clients’ senior leadership needs by identifying potentially qualified candidates and assisting clients in evaluating and assessing these candidates. Retained executive search firms generally are compensated for their services regardless of whether the client employs a candidate identified by the search firm and are generally retained on an exclusive basis. Typically, retained executive search firms are paid a retainer for their services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, executive search firms often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. In contrast, contingency search firms are compensated only upon successfully placing a recommended candidate.
We are a retained executive search firm. Our search process typically consists of the following steps:

•Analyzing the client’s business needs in order to understand its organizational structure, relationships and culture, advising the client as to the required set of skills and experiences for the position, and identifying with the client the other characteristics desired of the successful candidate;
•Selecting, contacting, interviewing and evaluating candidates on the basis of experience and potential cultural fit with the client organization;
•Presenting confidential written reports on the candidates who potentially fit the position specification;
•Scheduling a mutually convenient meeting between the client and each candidate;
•Completing reference checks on the final candidate selected by the client; and
•Assisting the client in structuring compensation packages and supporting the successful candidate’s integration into the client team.
On-Demand Talent. In April 2021, we acquired Business Talent Group, LLC ("BTG"), a market-leader in sourcing high-end, on-demand independent talent. Our on-demand services provide clients seamless on-demand access to top independent talent, including professionals with deep industry and functional expertise for interim leadership roles and critical, project-based initiatives. Our unique model delivers the right independent talent on demand by blending proprietary data and technology with a dedicated Talent Solutions team.As a result of the acquisition,we identified a new operating segment, On-Demand Talent. This segment represented less than 10% of our net revenue in 2021.
Heidrick Consulting. As a complement and extension of our search services, we partner with organizations through Heidrick Consulting to unlock the power of their people. Our tools and experts use data and technology to bring science to the art of human capital development and organizational design. Our services allow our clients to accelerate their strategies and the effectiveness of individual leaders, teams and organizations as a whole. 
Heidrick Consulting offers our clients groundbreaking approaches to human capital development through a myriad of solutions, ranging from leadership assessment and development, team and organization acceleration, digital acceleration and innovation, diversity and inclusion advisory services, and culture shaping. Applying our deep understanding of the behaviors and attributes of leaders across many of the world’s premier companies, we guide our clients as they build a thriving culture of future-ready leadership. These premium services and offerings, which complement our Executive Search expertise, significantly contribute to our ability to deliver a full-service human capital consulting solution to our clients. 
We continue to focus on increasing the scale and impact of our Heidrick Consulting business and expect to improve the operating margins of this important business as we do so. Our consulting services generate revenue primarily through the professional fees generated for each engagement which are generally based on the size of the project and scope of services. Our Heidrick Consulting teams have pivoted to create new digital solutions for Leadership Assessments, Team Acceleration, and Organization and Culture Acceleration that can be delivered virtually in response to the global pandemic. This segment represented less than 10% of our net revenue in 2021.
Organization
Our organizational structure, which is arranged by geography, service offering and industry and functional practices, is designed to enable us to better understand our clients’ cultures, operations, business strategies, industries and regional markets for leadership talent.
Geographic Structure. We provide senior-level executive search and consulting services to our clients worldwide through a network of 48 offices in 28 countries including our affiliates. Each office size varies; however, major locations are staffed with consultants, research associates, administrative assistants and other support staff. Administrative functions are centralized where possible, although certain support and research functions are situated regionally because of variations in local requirements. We face risks associated with political instability, legal requirements and currency fluctuations in our international operations. Examples of such risks include difficulties in managing global operations, social and political instability, regulations and potential adverse tax consequences. For a more complete description of the risks associated with our business see the Section in this Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors”.
In addition to our wholly owned subsidiaries, our worldwide network includes affiliate relationships in South Africa and Turkey. We have no financial investment in these affiliates but receive licensing fees from them for the use of our name and our databases. Licensing fees are less than 1% of our net revenue.
Information by Geography. We operate our Executive Search services in three geographic regions, each of which is reported as a separate reporting segment: the Americas (which includes the countries in North and South America); Europe 
(which includes the continents of Europe and Africa); and Asia Pacific (which includes Asia and the region generally known as the Middle East). Our On-Demand Talent and Heidrick Consulting reporting segments operates globally.
Americas Executive Search. As of December 31, 2021, we had 193 consultants in our Americas segment. The largest offices in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are located in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.
Europe Executive Search. As of December 31, 2021, we had 103 consultants in our Europe segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.
Asia Pacific Executive Search. As of December 31, 2021, we had 69 consultants in our Asia Pacific segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Japan.
On-Demand Talent - The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United States and the United Kingdom.
Heidrick Consulting. As of December 31, 2021, we had 69 consultants in our Heidrick Consulting segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.
The relative percentages of net revenue attributable to each segment were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Executive Search | | | | | 
Americas | 58 | % | | 58 | % | 58 | %
Europe | 17 | % | | 20 | % | 19 | %
Asia Pacific | 11 | % | | 13 | % | 14 | %
On-Demand Talent | 7 | % | | — | % | — | %
Heidrick Consulting | 7 | % | | 9 | % | 9 | %

For financial information relating to each segment, see Note 18, Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Global Industry Practices. Our executive search and consulting businesses operate in six broad industry groups listed below. These industry categories and their relative sizes, as measured by billings for 2021, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:

 | Percentage of Billings
Global Industry Practices | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Financial Services | 27 | % | | 25 | % | 26 | %
Global Technology & Services | 23 | | | 21 | | 21 | 
Industrial | 20 | | | 20 | | 21 | 
Consumer Markets | 15 | | | 17 | | 17 | 
Healthcare & Life Sciences | 13 | | | 14 | | 12 | 
Social Impact | 2 | | | 3 | | 3 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Within each broad industry group are a number of industry sub-sectors. Consultants often specialize in one or more sub-sectors to provide clients with market intelligence and candidate knowledge specific to their industry. For example, within the Financial Services sector, our business is diversified amongst a number of industry sub-sectors including Asset & Wealth Management, Consumer & Commercial Finance, Commodities, Corporate and Transaction Banking, Global Markets, Hedge Fund, Infrastructure, Investment Banking, Insurance, Private Equity Investment Professionals and Real Estate.
We service our clients with global industry interests and needs through unified global executive search teams who specialize in industry practices. This go-to-market strategy allows us to leverage our global diversity and market intelligence and is designed to provide better client service. Each client is served by one global account team, which we believe is a key differentiator from our competition.
Global Functional Practices. Our Executive Search consultants also specialize in searches for specific “C-level” functional positions, which are roles that generally report directly to the chief executive officer.
Our Global Functional Practices include Chief Executive Officer & Board of Directors; Human Resources Officers, Financial Officers; Information and Technology Officers, Legal, Risk, Compliance & Government Affairs, Marketing, Sales and Strategy Officers and Supply Chain and Operations.
Our team of Executive Search consultants may service clients from any one of our offices around the world. For example, an executive search for a chief financial officer of an industrial company located in the United Kingdom may involve an executive search consultant in the United Kingdom with an existing relationship with the client, another executive search consultant in the United States with expertise in our Industrial practice and a third executive search consultant with expertise in recruiting chief financial officers. This same industrial client may also engage us to perform skill-based assessments for each of its senior managers, which could require the expertise of one of our leadership advisory consultants trained in this service.
Client Base
For many of our clients, our global access to and knowledge of regional and functional markets and candidate talent is an important differentiator of our business. Our clients generally fall into one of the following categories:

•Fortune 1000 companies;
•Major U.S. and non-U.S. companies;
•Middle market and emerging growth companies;
•Private equity firms;
•Governmental, higher education and not-for-profit organizations; and
•Other leading private and public entities.
Clients and Marketing
Our consultants market the firm’s executive search and consulting services through two principal means: targeted client calling and industry networking with clients and referral sources. These efforts are supported by proprietary databases, which provide our consultants with information as to contacts made by their colleagues with particular referral sources, candidates and clients. In addition, we benefit from a significant number of referrals generated by our reputation for high quality service and successfully completed assignments, as well as repeat business resulting from our ongoing client relationships.
In support of client calling and networking, the practice teams as well as individual consultants also author and publish articles and white papers on a variety of leadership and talent topics and trends around the world. Our consultants often present research findings and talent insights at notable conferences and events as well. Our insights are sometimes acknowledged by major media outlets and trade journalists. These efforts aid in the marketing of our services as well.
Either by agreement with the clients or to maintain strong client relationships, we may refrain from recruiting employees of a client, or possibly other entities affiliated with that client, for a specified period of time but typically not more than one year from the commencement of a search. We seek to mitigate any adverse effects of these off-limits arrangements by strengthening our long-term relationships, allowing us to communicate our belief to prospective clients that we can conduct searches effectively notwithstanding certain off-limits arrangements.
No single client accounted for more than 1% of our net revenue in 2021 and 2020, and no more than 2% in 2019. As a percentage of total revenue, our top ten clients in aggregate accounted for approximately 6% in 2021 and 2020, and 7% in 2019.
Information Management Systems
We rely on technology to support our consultants and staff in the search process. We employ a global approach to executive search built on better insights, more data and faster decision making facilitated by the use of our proprietary Infinity Framework and Heidrick Connect. Our Infinity Framework allows clients to holistically evaluate a candidate's pivotal experience and expertise, leadership capabilities, agility and potential, and culture fit and impact, thereby allowing our clients to find the right person for the role. We supplement our Infinity Framework through a series of additional online tools including our Leadership Accelerator, Leadership Signature and Culture Signature assessments. Heidrick Connect, a completely digital, always available, client experience portal allows our clients to access talent insights for each engagement, including the Infinity 
Framework and other proprietary assessment tools. In response to working remotely, our Executive Search teams employed Heidrick Connect to operate effectively and efficiently while engaging virtually with our clients. Additionally, we have introduced upgrades to Heidrick Connect, resulting in greater flexibility, increased productivity and the ability to deliver more insights to our clients. 
Our consulting business’ proprietary Web-based system, Culture Connect, is integral to the culture-shaping process. This technology platform enables our consultants to administer, analyze and interpret online Corporate Culture Profiles™ surveys to develop clarity around team and organizational need and desired outcomes. In addition, we gather data using our online Culture Impact Survey™ to determine which culture-shaping concepts are being utilized by individuals and the team as a whole. Our Heidrick Consulting teams have pivoted to create new digital solutions for Leadership Assessments, Team Acceleration, and Organization and Culture Acceleration that can be delivered virtually in response to required social distancing practices.
Competition
The executive search industry is highly competitive. While we face competition to some degree from all firms in the industry, we believe our most direct competition comes from four established global retained executive search firms that conduct searches primarily for the most senior-level positions within an organization. In particular, our competitors include Egon Zehnder International, Korn Ferry, Russell Reynolds Associates, and Spencer Stuart. To a lesser extent, we also face competition from smaller boutique firms that specialize in certain regional markets or industry segments and Internet-based firms. Each firm with which we compete is also a competitor in the marketplace for effective search consultants.
Overall, the search industry has relatively few barriers to entry; however, there are higher barriers to entry to compete with global retained executive search firms that can provide leadership consulting services at the senior executive level. At this level, clients rely more heavily on a search firm’s reputation, global access and the experience level of its consultants. We believe that the segment of executive search in which we compete is more quality-sensitive than price-sensitive. As a result, we compete on the level of service we offer, reflected by our client services specialties and, ultimately, by the quality of our search results. We believe that our emphasis on senior-level executive search, the depth of experience of our search consultants and our global presence enable us to compete favorably with other executive search firms.
Competition in the leadership consulting markets in which we operate is highly fragmented, with no universally recognized market leaders.
Seasonality
There is no discernible seasonality in our business. Revenue and operating income have historically varied by quarter and are hard to predict from quarter to quarter. In addition, the volatility in the global economy and business cycles can impact our quarterly revenue and operating income.
Human Capital Resources
As a premier provider of leadership advisory services, people are at the center of all we do. Using our culture as a differentiator to attract, develop and retain the highest-performing talent and build a more diverse and inclusive firm is a strategic priority. 
Employee Summary. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,846 individuals, comprised of 1,081 in the Americas, 482 in Europe, and 283 in Asia Pacific. Our headcount includes 434 consultants (365 related to Executive Search and 69 related to Heidrick Consulting), 575 associates and 837 other search, consulting, on-demand, support, and Global Operations Support employees.
Within Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting, our professionals are generally categorized either as consultants or associates. Associates assist consultants by providing research support, coordinating candidate contact and performing other engagement-related functions. We promote our associates to consultants during the annual consultant promotion process, and we recruit our consultants from other executive search or human capital firms, or in the case of executive search, consultants new to search who have worked in industries or functions represented by our practices. In the latter case, these are often seasoned executives with extensive contacts and outstanding reputations who are entering the search profession as a second career and whom we train in our techniques and methodologies. Our Heidrick Consulting consultants are recruited for their executive business experience as well as their skills in consulting and leadership advisory and often are former clients who are familiar with our consulting methodology. We are not a party to any U.S. or non-U.S.-based collective bargaining agreement, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Diversity Equity and Inclusion. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to make meaningful contributions. Our commitment to hold ourselves accountable by measuring our own diversity and inclusion is demonstrated by our achievements as of December 31, 2021:
•Women represented 64% of our overall workforce. In 2021, women represented 69% of our new hires and 65% of our promotions.
•People of color represented 26% of our overall workforce. In 2021, people of color accounted for 35% of our new hires and 21% of our promotions.
•37.5% of our Board of Directors consists of women and 25% consists of people of color, including three women, one Black man and one Asian man. 
•Our Management Committee, a global body, is 32% gender diverse and 9% racially/ ethnically diverse, including nine women, one of whom is Black, and one Asian man. 
•50% of the CEO’s direct reports are diverse, including seven women, one of whom is Multiracial. 
•Our Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary and Global Managing Partner, Head of Search Go-To-Market are women. 
•Our Regional Leader, Americas is a Black woman; our Regional Leader, Europe is a woman.
•The leader of our Americas CEO & Board practice and global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion practice is a Black man and our Managing Partner, Culture Shaping is a Hispanic woman.
•Women lead our Corporate Officers, CEO & Board, CHRO and Financial Officers practices and two of our largest offices.

Diversity , equity and inclusion (“DEI”) is imperative for our internal culture, as we believe it drives innovation and future growth. We have committed substantial time and resources to advance diversity in our workforce and create a culture of inclusion, where everyone feels valued and supported, and is encouraged to meaningfully contribute to our success through 
authentic participation. By cultivating a culture that brings the maximum range of ideas and experiences to our work with clients around the world, we believe we create better solutions to our clients’ business challenges and win as one firm.
In 2021, our DEI efforts were comprised of many initiatives, including:
•Applying our proprietary DEI process, anchored by a robust organizational diagnostic. The process was activated in 2021 after holding working sessions with firm leadership, planning for a firm-wide programmatic cascade and establishing dynamic diversity aspirations.
•Investing in and expanding key development and mentorship programs to accelerate the advancement of our diverse talent and enhance our culture of inclusion. For instance, we expanded our U.S.-based Advancing Black Leaders mentorship program to include all junior and mid-level, new hire professionals of color. We also completed the third cohort of Accelerating Women’s Excellence (AWE), our flagship program to develop high-potential women for promotion into leadership positions of increasing responsibility.
•Launching firm-wide DEI learning content through our Inclusive Culture Learning Journeys – a monthly collection of content for our employees to broaden their knowledge around the topics of diversity, inclusion and integrity. Each month, we introduce a new theme and share relevant articles and learning resources focused on strengthening our inclusive culture and aligning with our Values.
•Launching regional HRIS system campaigns to allow employees to voluntarily self-identify with respect to gender, ethnicity and LGBTQ+ identity, in order to facilitate a better understanding of the composition of our employee community and accurate measurement and monitoring our progress against diverse workforce objectives.
•Continuing employee resource group-led initiatives including: 
•Our Professionals of Color (POC) employee research group ("ERG") hosted a webinar on the topic of “Courageous Conversation” with Congresswoman Grace Meng; 
•Pride@Heidrick hosted several global informational sessions on topics including Gender, Sex and Sexuality, The LGBTQ+ Acronym, Inclusive Language and Tips for being an Ally; 
•Our Pride, Americas Women’s Inclusion Network and POC ERGs came together to host a session on “unraveling Identity” discussing the ways unique identities shape our experiences in the workplace and beyond. 
We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion are key elements of an organization’s ability to mobilize, execute and transform with agility. Our commitment to DEI is a key strategic imperative that is deeply rooted in our organizational values. 
Our Values. We believe that our success is grounded in how we operate each and every day as individual professionals and, collectively, as a firm. In 2015, we formalized our long-held beliefs into defined values to guide our employees – Grow with our clients; Win as one firm; Always act with Integrity; and Own the results. These values still represent who we are and who we want to be. With the unique circumstances brought on by the pandemic and the renewed urgency to address racial inequality, in 2020, we added the very important new value – Respect and value each individual, to more clearly articulate our commitment to increasing diversity and fostering an inclusive environment. Our values serve to guide us in how we approach our business and how we treat our colleagues and clients, and also help us build trust and a common understanding of what we stand for and believe in as a firm.
Employee Engagement.  Every two years we provide all employees with the opportunity to share their perspectives and feedback on their experience within our organization through our proprietary Organization Accelerator Questionnaire (“OAQ”). The results are organized against a research-based framework we call META, which provides insight into how the organization mobilizes, executes, and transforms with agility. The OAQ captures an individual’s perception of the organization, as well as their own personal experience within the organization, and tracks progress from period to period, while also benchmarking teams within the same organization. The insights provided enable focused action planning. Results of the questionnaire are measured, analyzed and discussed in live sessions in each office to enhance the employee experience, drive change, and leverage the overall success of our organization. On a global basis, 92% of our employees participated in our second firm-wide OAQ which was conducted in 2020. Results showed marked improvement across all areas, in spite of the survey being conducted in a pandemic year. In addition, we continue to focus in key areas that affect employee engagement such as recognition, simplicity and communications.
In addition, we use pulse surveys to gain timely feedback and insights on employee sentiment. Our “Voice of Employee” tools include traditional survey questions, blended with “digital conversations” on a platform that provides real-time feedback enabled by machine learning and AI technology, that is designed to identify actionable initiatives. 
Finally, we have a global network of Culture Champions who work closely with our leadership to support, reinforce, and challenge the alignment of cultural values with the day-to-day experience of employees and clients. 
Learning and Development. We are committed to the professional development of our employees and promoting a continuous learning culture within our firm. Our learning and development programs have been created with the goal of building leadership, business development, account management, client service, and change leadership skills among our employees. In addition to building personal and professional capabilities, these programs set a standard for the behaviors that will help us realize our business goals and strategies.
In 2021, our Learning & Development team delivered over 12,800 hours of aggregate live training to our colleagues globally throughout the year across all programs. We continued with a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our learning catalog outlines dozens of live, virtual programs and thousands of eLearning courses designed to help build and enhance employee leadership, business acumen and business development skills. These programs are continually updated to reflect best practices and feedback received from employees.
Participation in our Communities. We are proud members and eager participants in communities where we work. We know first-hand from our client work the positive eﬀects that strong leaders can bring to both organizations and communities, and to encourage employees to contribute to our communities as well.
The Company formed a Global Philanthropic Committee in 2019 to establish a coordinated, global approach to supporting the charitable causes and philanthropic endeavors that impact our employees, clients and communities. We collaborate to find appropriate charitable and community causes by promoting suggestions to the Global Philanthropic Committee. In 2021, employees participated in our 3rd annual Global Day of Service where 442 colleagues in 35 offices around the world supported 38 non-profit organizations. We also respect the right of our employees to independently engage in charitable causes and encourage the same.
Compensation and Benefits. Our goal is not only to challenge our employees to reach their potential professionally, and reward them for great work, but also to understand and consider their need to be simultaneously healthy, balanced and focused. We believe in fair compensation, based upon demonstrated capabilities and achievement, experience, and superior performance. We place great importance on incentivizing, recognizing, and rewarding performance and behaviors aligned with our values in the form of discretionary bonus awards. Through our benefits program, we demonstrate commitment to fostering an environment in which employees are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and in which the best talent wants to work and thrive. Our benefits are administered on a country-by-country basis, so that benefits are comparable to other employers within each jurisdiction and our industry. We use several measures to ensure that our benefits offerings are up-to-date, competitive in the marketplace, and in line with employee needs, including employee surveys, benchmarking exercises, and other benefits measurement tools. Benefits offered to our employees may include annual leave and other paid time off, medical, dental and vision benefits, prescription drug benefits, flexible spending accounts, employee assistance programs, 401(k) and deferred compensation retirement programs, short and long-term disability insurance, critical illness insurance and life insurance.
Employee Safety. As we continue to navigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been ensuring the health and safety of our employees, clients and the communities where we live and work around the globe. To minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, and in line with guidance and mandates from local and national governments and health authorities, we have rolled out our “flexible workspace” guidance across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Under this guidance, our employees have the flexibility to work remotely several days per week, with variations depending upon location and role, and in alignment with country- or state-level guidance. In addition, we will take a phased approach to returning to offices, with the health and wellbeing of our employees as our top priority. As we plan for the future of work, we expect to provide our employees with enhanced flexibility in how and where we work while maintaining our culture of mentorship, collaboration and community.
We continued to take steps in 2021 to support our employees during the ongoing health crisis resulting from the pandemic, including monitoring guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and other relevant health authorities and sharing such guidance with our employees. We have provided various benefits and resources related to the pandemic, including mental health resources and additional support, and a recognized Global Mental Health Day. We encourage our managers to communicate frequently with their team members to support them through the continued challenging times of COVID-19. We continue to engage with both state and national governments to understand their approaches to vaccination (including the extent to which regulation may cover some of our employees), and with our employees to educate them about vaccines and the importance of being vaccinated. Further, we rolled out our vaccination policy in the U.S. and Canada in September 2021, which states that all employees, contractors and guests must provide a proof of vaccination to visit a Heidrick & Struggles office in the U.S. or Canada.

Ethics. Employees are encouraged to speak to their colleagues and representatives in Legal and Human Resources whenever an ethical question or situation arises. We also have established the Heidrick & Struggles EthicsLine, a service that provides a mechanism for reporting alleged breaches of any legal or regulatory obligations, financial fraud, including accounting, internal controls and auditing, or any alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or corporate policies to the Company. The EthicsLine is a web-based and telephonic reporting hotline available to all company employees, contractors, vendors, stockholders, clients, or other interested parties. The EthicsLine is administered by an independent third party that is separate from the Company and specializes in running whistleblower hotline programs for companies throughout the U.S. Calls are not recorded and callers may remain anonymous. The EthicsLine is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To contact the EthicsLine, you may dial 800-735-0589 toll-free in the U.S. or 704-731-7242 outside the U.S. or by visiting https://heidrickandstruggles.alertline.com.
Regulation
We are subject to the U.S. securities laws and general corporate and commercial laws and regulations of the locations which we serve. These include regulations regarding anti-bribery, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, data security, data retention, personal information, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. Most notably, certain aspects of our business are subject to the EU's and UK's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). We have a global privacy program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with global privacy regulations, including GDPR and other rapidly emerging privacy and data protection laws in countries such as Brazil and China, or states in the U.S such as California. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to change.
